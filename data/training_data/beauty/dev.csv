45270,0,"The cream is very good, but the price is quite high for such a tiny, little tube. Think I'll look for an alternative product or source."
171720,0,"I've been using this soap for years and I love it. Keeps my skin very clear. However, I think that the company has stopped making the soap because I can't find it in stores or on the Burt's Bee's website. I ordered through Amazon and the soap smells differently than it normally does. Almost like it's expired/dated or infused with a fake smell. Not sure what's going on with that."
199180,0,"Did Tresor change or did I? certainly from 20 years ago I have changed. It was magic, magic, magic: soft wonderful apricot, rose, floral musky beauty. I worked overtime to afford it. A whole shift back in the day, 8 nasty hours on one's feet. It was worth it. Fast forward 15 years: I bought a large bottle and its just not the same. Boring, generic stuff. The bottle certainly looks authentic but perhaps the juice has been reformulated. I'll probably give it away, sigh."
171102,1,This is a neon pink polish that I absolutely love. It is so bright and smooth. And on top of that I got it brand new for only a penny with free shipping (I think somebody messed up really bad on that one). What an AWESOME deal!!!
10946,0,"Claiborne Sport is a good cologne, but like Claiborne Curve, the smell may be a bit overwhelming. There are other sport colognes out there that are much better."
112997,0,The reason I say this hair dryer is just ok and gave it 3 stars is because I've had 2 of them. The first one only worked for a week and then I had to return it. It would only blow out luke warm air at half the speed it should. The second one works great. I do love how shiny the dryer makes my hair. It is worth the money if you get one that works. My hair looks great!
298,1,I am in my 40th and have very good skin in general. Over the years I tried many different creams (both expensive & inexpensive brands) and keeps coming back to this one. It's light weight and it does not feel greasy at all. It works great to keep my skin moisturized at night & exfoliated at the same time. It's a great cream and the price is great-I get it from Butystore when they have super discount :-)NeoStrata makes very good functional products. Will definitely buy it again.
37859,1,"lo recomiendo al aplicarse el polvo compacto deja la piel como una porcelana, dura en la piel y es facil de retirar de la piel junto con el maquillaje"
236380,0,"I was hoping I would not need 3 layers of this polish to get the full effect of the look-it DOES look great after the 3 coats AND a good, shiny top coat. Mine did peel off in chucks but he next day, however. :-(. Maybe a good look for an evening out-that's about it."
236616,2,"I've tried several of these eyelash growth products. Mavala Double Lash, unfortunately, did not work. First of all, I'm a little paranoid about product tampering, especially with something that's going to be applied near my eyes. The Mavala Double Lash bottle did not come with a safety seal around the cap. It did come in a box, but inside the box was a single styrofoam peanut. I found that somewhat odd, and it made me a little concerned that someone could have put something in the bottle. Anyway, I used it on my brows for the first week and then decided it was probably safe to use on my eyelashes, which I've been doing for the last six weeks. I can't say that I've seen a noticeable difference. And I'm not crazy about the odor. It's not particularly strong, but it has a glue-like smell. Also, I'm near the end of the bottle and it seems like the remaining product has hardened. It comes out in chunks on the tip of the applicator. If you're really serious about growing longer eyelashes, opt for Rapid Lash or Renew Lash. They are more expensive, but I've had fantastic results with both of those products."
71447,1,"At last I have a product that has solved a long standing problem. Terranova Shea Butter has eliminated the dry, flaky, skin on my legs. I have tried so many lotions and creams over the years and none of them worked. My daughter gave me this Shea butter as a gift. I have only been using it for about three weeks. I use it on my face, arms and legs. I am delighted with the improvement in the look and the condition of my skin. I use it on my face and am very pleased with the result. After I cream my face,I run my hands through my hair and it produces a non-greasy shine. I only do it once between washings."
102284,1,"Sublime is a chypre-floral with an oakmoss developing into jasmine and citrus. The dry-down is elegant. When you spray it intially, however, it is VERY strong. Two sprays in the bath scented the entire house. The flask is gorgeous, like a lotus bud."
90854,1,Stila eye shadow pans are super! They are apllied easily and they last all day! The eye shadows are very affordable and they are true to the color that you see! I would highly recommend this product!
201245,0,"I read all the reviews before purchasing and I was very excited when I saw that it smells just like fresh laundry but when I received it for Christmas and took that first sniff my high hopes were deflated. The scent is nice but it did not smell like laundry to me. I was hoping for a downy, snuggle or bounce type smell. This product is a bit flowery sort of old ladyish. I don't know if I got a defective bottle or not but I just wanted to share my experience."
10455,0,"Well, it's actually a hygiene product, but you get the point. It works. It's a little wet and its easy to drip the stuff on the floor, but it beats getting infected with some brat's rhinovirus."
4259,1,I gave these as a gift to my wife once and since then she has refused to use any other hair elastic. This is the best one out there.
10234,1,It tastes and smells amazing like marshmallows love liplites!! This is so pretty and glossy definetly reccomended by me great buy!!!
185769,1,"This is a very pretty color that will look great on any skin tone. I honestly bought it because I heard this was the color Kate Middleton wore on her wedding day. I purchased it here because it was cheaper than in stores, and I couldn't find it in any stores! I'm glad I got this shade that I can wear and I know where I can buy another bottle when I run out of this shade."
228046,0,clairol conditioner much better...high in price...did nothing for hair rather thick to put on and rinse..wld not buy again..hard to rinse out of hair
118244,0,I had an old version of this dryer for over 20 years and loved it. It went to 3 different homes with me. The one I just purchased doesn't heat up as much for drying/curling hair at same time. Have to use a curling iron now. Not happy about adding a step to morning routine.
217348,2,"Love my other B&B products (Sunday shampoo and Coco shampoo/conditioner), but for the price I don't find much to rave about with this product. Slight scent is OK, but don't feel any real tonic action--very little if any tingling or refreshing feeling as described by other reviewers. Cleans ok though. Maybe just me, but was disappointed with this purchase otherwise."
251610,2,"this product does not do anything, applying lotion would provide better results. I have left this on for over 30 minutes and can not see any difference"
79530,2,"I would never buy from Perfumia again. The bottle of Estee Lauder perfume smells like a bottle of alcohol. I contacted Perfumia for a refund and they will only refund a part of my money, and only if the package was not opened. HOW DO YOU TELL THAT A BOTTLE OF PERFUME IS BAD UNLESS YOU OPEN IT!!! Please spread the word about this company."
249619,0,"I picked this color because I am working on going back to my natural color. This dark blonde turned out more of a light brown. Still not a bad color, just not what I was going for. Oh, and the color holds very well, it's been 3 weeks since I colored it and hardly any change!"
99293,0,"The product arrived and the lid was faulty. The spray part would not come out and after being opened once the bottle refused to close. I logged on and attempted to return it but noted that colognes can't be returned. Highly irritated, I tried speaking to customer service using the live chat option. Within 10 minutes I had a response and was informed my replacement was on its way. Naturally I havn't received it yet, but assuming it arrives - BRILLIANT service from Amazon. Did make me a little concerned about the quality of the product though! Anywaz, smells good!"
5461,1,"I've seen both positive and negative reviews for this product. Since twelve years old, I have had issues with acne, particularly blackheads. I tried Proactiv for six months and I didn't really notice any change in my acne. After several years, I decided a month ago to try AcneFree Severe, simply because it's supposed to work well against stubborn cases. So far I'm pretty impressed; I started off with worse acne, but things have settled down. I'm not completely clear, but much better than I was with Proactiv. It can dry out skin, so I make sure to use a moisturizer, and that eliminates it.Keep in mind, I'm not saying Proactiv doesn't work--it does for some people, I'm sure. But AcneFree seems to be working for me."
152011,1,"I love this hair turban! I've tried 2 other kinds; this one is so much lighter, softer, and fluffier AND stays in place. Very nice."
200238,0,If you sweat stained shirt collar.Covers well...anyway...Even after hairspray fraction disslved by rain./water/Covers well and does not fail in dry weather.
184320,2,"This is my first time using any China Glaze product, and I have to say that I'm disappointed. I read so many rave reviews about China Glaze, and the fact that they add clay as a hardener seems appealing (I'm a busy house-wife who tends to chip her polish). However, I think the clay addition might be its downfall. This stuff is thick, goopy, and takes FOREVER to dry. 3 hours after application, and I could still leave an impression on the surface of my nails. Not good! The polish also went on rather streaky. I wasn't able to test out how hard or long-lasting the product is, because I had to use nail polish remover before it even fully dried (4 hours after application). For those interested, I did use a base & (fast drying) top coat. i could literally feel the polish squishing around in between base & top coat, so I knew it was not dry. Big pain in the ass. China Glaze has let me down. Perhaps not all color formulas are as difficult as the Re-fresh Mint."
191526,0,"The nail side of the brush could and should be stronger. I'm in the garden every day this time of year and found myself spending just as much time trying to clean my nails as it took for me to get them dirty! There's no way to choose the colors that are available, either. I ordered 3, and got three different colors."
229069,1,I Love it!!! This is the best Cologne ever!!! I get headaches from most perfumes and colognes... but not this kind. The price was great and it makes my hubby smell amazing!!!
23744,2,"First let me say this is my first review although I have been buying from Amazon for years. I also have been using Mrs. Meyers products for several years. I believe my most recent purchase of Mrs. Meyer's hand soap is a knock off. I have the real stuff from the company and this order of hand soap does not smell or feel the same. It smells pungent, very drying and the bottles were broken. Ingredients are slightly different and the back label is different. I am going to contact both Amazon and Mrs. Meyers company, but I felt I should warn others."
185805,0,"A travel companion raved to me about this makeup and I had to try it. Basically, I like the feel of this makeup. It's really soft and it feels nice when I am wearing it. It's also long lasting which is also really nice. My biggest issue with this foundation is the color. I have really ivory/fair skin and in certain lighting it appears orange. I also bought the lightest shade which is Ivory. If this foundation matched my skin color I would consider buying it again, but the price to way too high."
54346,2,"Gentlemen, I wonder when they will make the refund of the purchase on my credit card issued in May, because they never received the product.Thank you"
231554,0,"This is a review for the color ""Shindig""Its a little more pink then I would have expected. I thought it would be more of an orange color. However, the color started to grow on me the longer I wore it. It has a very pretty pearly sort of sheen to it which gives it some interest. Its not my favorite color but I usually lean more toward blues, purples, and greens. The color was quite sheer too. I think it took me about 4 coats to get it to a nice opaqueness. All in all, I don't this I would purchase this color again, but I'll use up the rest of the bottle."
56178,1,"I'm a guy, so this perfume I obviously purchased as a Holiday gift for a ""lovely"" young lady. & she loved it !!!! & it smells great on her !!! Very satisfied with the super fast delivery !!! Thanx Amazon !!! Regards, Joseph. Scranton, PA."
163789,0,"Beautifully designed, easy to handle BUT power is severely lacking. Would take an hour to actually dry even slightly damp short hair with this device."
6089,0,"I really expected more from this product. I dropped one bag directly into the water while i ran my bath. Although the fragrance was pleasant, it was too weak. Next time i will try steeping the bag in boiling water on the stove first."
120304,2,This was the worst mascara long lasting or otherwise I have ever tried.The first morning after I applied it my top and bottom eyelashes were literally knitted together so I couldn't open my eyes. The rest of the formula was in two large smudges under my eyes. terrible
16148,2,"Because I liked this soap I ordered 9 bars and received 9 bars of Pure & Natural in various aged packaging. The soap appears to be rather old the packaging somewhat sun-faded and of mixed parentage, different wrappers some from Pure & Natural and others from Dial Soap. I called the telephone number on the soap and was informed by Dial that their Dial Basic was the identical product and the Pure & Natural label had been discontinued. So instead of spending a fortune on soap from here, shipping cost more than my 9 bars, look about in the supermarket for Dial Basic because it's the same thing with different packaging. And will probably be a year or so younger."
200637,2,"I love J. Lo's GLOW perfume, so this was a big disapointment. This particular perfume has a very strong, bitter lime scent when first applied, and even after it dries, does not ""wear"" well at all. My daughter detected cocoa and vanilla in it, but for me, the lime/citrus scent is most predominant. I think it would be oppressive on a hot day. I didn't like this scent at all, but it may be suitable for a very young girl -- it seems like a very ""young"" scent. This is of course strictly personal opinion, but frankly the smell of this perfume reminded me of Joy lime-scented dishwashing liquid."
81725,2,"I was unaware that they are selling tester bottles until my order arrived. Nowhere on the product info does it say this. I ordered it as a gift for my sister and now I will feel like a cheap person if I give this to her. With shipping, this price was only a couple dollars cheaper than the other sellers on Amazon who include a cap with their bottles, as well as the cute pink and white striped cylinder it comes in. This product does not include either of those things."
196101,0,"This is a nice ""okay"" fragrance. It's only draw back is that it doesn't have staying power unless you use a lot. Cologne shouldn't arrive before you do - but I like to know that it's there.I smelled the cologne on a co-worker who is from Sierra Leone. Oddly enough, it was because he sprayed a tad too much - which is how I came to notice it. Now I understand why he over did it a bit.As a side note; this same guy told me something interesting. This fragrance is by a French designer. My co-worker told me that once a cologne/parfum crosses an ocean, it changes it's scent. He said that it is a known mystery. Can anyone validate this?"
138709,2,I ordered this product and received 3/4 inch product. It didn't come close to anything that I ordered and was of real poor quality. What were they thinking when they shipped the product. I will forget and keep the product and they will have made a good deal. I needed the hair curler in time for my daughter for certain occasion. I returned it and am hoping to receive the money back along with the shipping charges. Let us hope.
137075,2,"Ok, so there are apparently two shades with the same name:*One is (theoretically) a sheer pale pink that is said to be pretty. Sadly, that's not what this is.*The other is a beige-pink sheer shade, which I thought it would be an ok consolation prize.I was SO wrong. This was unoriginal, blah, milky, sorta-nude. HIGHLY disappointing. There may be folk who like this, but I'm not one of them. Coverage is average for a sheer, prone to streaking. It doesn't chip too quickly.But if you really /must/ have such a meh nude tone? You can get roughly the same color with Sally Hansen's ""Shall We Dance?""[That's in their ""Complete Salon Manicure"" line. Oddly, it's LEAGUES better. I never thought to see it outperform OPI, but it certainly did in this case. Everything from the brush to the coverage to the lasting power. Go figure.]Seriously, ditch Bubble Bath and just buy that instead."
77813,1,"The color was beautiful, wonderful texture and consistency. No smell or flavor, which was great, also lasts a very long time. I would recommend this product to everyone. Thanks, NARS!"
226511,2,"Fantasy is all vanilla on me. Granted, it's a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting that's has decent longevity & isn't sickly, almost like buttercream ... but sweeter, creamer, wetter. Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom. Weird because vanilla isn't even a listed note. Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain. Don't know.Some have said that Fantasy is similar to Escada Magnetism. On that we agree. However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better. Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile & more mature from Fantasy. However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T. For that, it is very well done."
227498,0,"Lovely warmth when my feet are cold, but the inserts are lumpy, thick, and very uncomfortable to walk on."
27250,0,"This sunscreen is a bit oily probably because it was left in the mailbox in sunny Florida. The emulsion must have separated due to heat, will not buy again via mail."
203092,1,"I have been using Alfred Sung cologne for over 25 years, it is refreshing and delicate not overwhelming . I get so many complements,a nice and mature fragrance, very exotic I love it and very glad Amazon carries it, I can not find it any where any more Thanks Amazon!"
50793,2,"I bought this product because of all the good reviews. It was a huge mistake. It does not keep my hair curled for longer than an hour. I have attempted different ways to keep the curl, and time after time, it doesn't get any better. Also it takes forever for the rollers to get your hair curled."
85274,1,"I am using this rosewater on my face and hair. I have noticed my skin is a little less red after about a week. Most important is my hair. I have very oily hair. I wash it every morning and by the end of the day it's greasy. I have been perming or coloring my hair for years to try and ""dry"" it out. I had read that rosewater was good for oily hair and is it ever! The picture does not show this but the bottle came with a spray top which was excellent. I spray this on my scalp after my shower and it keeps the oil away all day. I can finally stop chemically treating my hair! I looked at a lot of products and this is the only one I saw that is JUST rosewater with nothing else in it. I need to stock up on this."
7622,0,"I didn't feel this spray smelled too much like PlayDoh, but I don't know that I would recognize the smell. This was a gag gift, I have a friend that adores playdoh and they loved it."
165803,0,"Very quick delivery. Nice taste, a bit strong but in the mean time really ""delicate"" too."
112365,1,"In true OPI fashion, this color is beautiful and the quality of the polish is exceptional. You can never go Erin with OPI"
110066,0,I have never seen a hair appliance with such a short cord. I can barely get it to my hair while using a mirror. My hair dryer has a cord that is 3 feet longer!
96068,0,"I finnally purchased this product. I can honestly say, i didnt notice much diffrence in the responses i got from women. I was a little buzzed so maybe i wasnt being attentive enough. Im a very socialeble person so i really dont need anything to help me be confident or more aggressive. I didnt feel more aggressive from using the product. I'll have to put it to another test. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. It's all to your perception. I could say some of the things that happend in my interactions could be attributed to the npa but i feel like its a strecth cause nothing spectacular happened. i'll have to use it on a 1 one 1 date and then provide another review. If your wanting a story to tell your friends this product likely is not going to provide that..."
52325,2,"I bought a product that I expected to be a retail item, not something that someone had taken a soldering iron to..there were two deep burns on the bottle where the lot number and a 'not for resale' marking had been partially removed by using a sharp, hot, tool to burn partially through the plastic, but the markings were still legible.I somehow think that this compromises the integrity of the bottle itself.When I returned it because I considered BURNS on the plastic bottle as as defect, Amazon refunded me less than half of what I paid."
91392,2,"This product belongs on the shelves of the ""Dollar Store"". Better to stick to well known Drugstore brands."
63956,2,"I've been using this for years. It's the only body wash that doesn't dry my skin or cause an allergic reaction. However, it's been discontinued. I went to the Jergens web site and they recommend their bar soap as a substitute. It's not the same and I am so not happy with them. Can anybody recommend anything else?"
251311,2,I really didn't like the product. I like the plain lip balm that either you don't carry anymore or you have been out of it for a good while.
61127,0,It feels great on skin but have not noticed any brightening effects to my skin. It does last for 24 hours.
80775,1,FusionBeauty LipFusion Micro-injected Collagen Lip Plump Gloss should be an essential part of your beauty routine... Why? Because it actually works!
181974,2,"I had acne for many years ever since 9th grade. After a series of treatment and thousands of dollars spent on spa, medication, treatment, etc, I was finally clear. Then I wanted to use a product that's not too harsh on the skin to stay clear. So I tried the anti bacterial wash because the sales person keeps recommending it (don't trust these people, they just want to make commission). After a few times, my face developed severe cysts (I haven't had them for like a year). These cysts wouldn't go away for months. Dermalogica has ruined all the hard work I did for years to make my skin clear. I can't tell you how much I regret using this product. WORST skin product ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
31961,0,"I love the color but the blue washes out within 2 weeks,I don't think I will buy this product agian unless I just want blue in for fun"
117784,1,"It is what it is - the eternal and forever fragrance. In case, you don't get it - I really like this! LOL"
241842,0,"I looked at all the microwaveable socks on offer, and wanted something that went over my ankle and kept me warm.You can't walk in these (but they tell you that, it's no surprise) but they do make your feet toasty warm.They lost a star only because you really can't walk in them, which makes them a bit cumbersome to use, but I heat them up, and then pop them on while watching TV and they do their job nicely. Also used them in bed, but they are lumpy, and won't function as sleep socks.Edited to add: Having had these for a year, I can tell you I bought a much better pair (not on line) and that I didn't use these often, not being able to walk or sleep in them really did prove too inconvenient. In retrospect I would not buy them again. I can edit the review but I can't edit the star rating, but if I could, I would rate them 2 stars."
8539,1,"I'm a professional model and actress and I've never tried Stila products before this. It's absolutely perfect for everyday wear. It goes on light and evens out my skin without looking like I have a ton of makeup caked on my face. I also like the subtle glow that it gives.I'm a natural redhead with a very unique, very pale skintone. I have a lot of trouble finding foundations that aren't too dark or too ""orange-y"". The Stila 10 watts has solved my troubles.As a model, I wouldn't use this for a photoshoot because it doesn't provide the maximum coverage needed for such things, but for regular daily wear it's great."
90811,1,"Used this product for about 2 years, then stopped and tried a few L'Oreal products only to have my skin breakout and become dry. Went back to this and the Active Moist and within a couple weeks my skin is back to normal!"
69061,0,"I am always looking for the ""best"" product to control my frizzies. This helps but does not do a complete job. I still have to blow dry and then use a flat iron to get my hair under control. It does help to make my hair silky and more manageable. Let's see what happens in the rain tomorrow."
123806,1,"I have used this product for quite a few years and have been extremely happy with how fabulous it makes my hair look. It creates a beautiful shine. I was very disappointed when all my local reatailers where I used to purchase it told me they no longer carried it - I was on a mission to find some place to purchase it. I could not find anywhere locally...so I went to Amazon.com, keyed in the name of the product and voila!. I ordered a dozen and I am one happy camper. Try it, you will love the beautiful shine it puts on your hair."
100831,0,"The color wasn't what I expected, it was actually a dark purple. It doesn't glide on too easily either."
53875,0,I love finally finding hot rollers that are large enough for my longer hair as large roller sets are very hard to find. However..they burn the heck out of my hands. I have other rollers that don't. I don't know what's under the velvet covering but....ouch! You really have to work fast. I'm constantly dropping them....very frustrating.
234449,0,"I bought this for my nice and she has straight dark brown hair. It still got tangled even doing small sections on the top layer of hair. Must use on dark hair or the color doesn't show up well. Leaves the hair gunky till it drys, takes 2 good washings for color to rinse out of hair. Plus it doesn't get your roots at all, there's atleast an inch of the color missing. Over all it was pretty neat to use but I will not buy her refills."
78593,0,"I had high hopes for this shampoo because I use a TheraNeem product on my face which is the best non steroid treatment I've ever found for eczema. This shampoo does take care of most of the scalp itch, but it's terribly drying and I find that I'm unable to use it without augmenting it. If I add several drops of jojoba oil to it I can prevent most of the drying but I still don't feel comfortable using this more than once a week.YMMV. Maybe somebody with really oily hair would appreciate this, or a guy with very little hair, but I'm used to my hair coming out soft and bouncy even if I shampoo daily, and this stuff makes it feel like straw."
140559,2,I am very disappointed!I have never rec'd this item or a credit (refund)for this item. I have called customer serviceseveral times & keep getting the run around.No resolution has transpired for this purchase.
24641,1,I use this in the morning and night and have been very happy with it. I use it paired with another eyecream and apply this one first. It has a cooling sensation and a little goes a long way. Don't be scared by the blue color because that does not show up on your skin. I feel like this helps my other cream absorb better and helps to reduce my under eye puffiness. I will buy again!
33661,2,Doesn't do anything! Total waste of money. I don't really expect a wonderful change but taking before and after picture just to see and not a single bit of difference.
68500,1,"I ordered the tie on eye patch. Lo and behold, they came with elastic! However my husband was VERY pleased with the elastic. So I guess this seller is somehow psychic!!!"
238420,0,"I purchased this item for my daughter-in-law's birthday and she already has one. I inquired as to returning it and expected an easy return with credit back to my card as Amazon does, especially since I ordered it from Amazon.To my dismay, I can only get a credit from the company that sent it to me and I can't use any of their other products, so I'm stuck with something neither of us can use which is very disappointing.I will be very careful in the future about purchasing items through the mail/on-line that cannot be returned."
103804,0,"Good value and great function, would recommend large open space and easy to use for travel. Nice gift at Christmas.."
69125,0,Just an OK product- Glad I didn't spend any more money than I did.Product was sent by mail in a small envelope so I don't know why it took so long to receive unless it's not a stock item.
27166,0,"It's OK, wasn't as ""wowed"" as I thought I'd be. Doesn't seem to last very long, maybe I'm not using enough? And doesn't smell to me at all like the oil, which also doesn't seem to last very long."
98762,0,"I received gel fast but to me it seems like it could have been filled more there was a small amount inside also the lid was sticky so I contacted the seller and they said let it sit and let the gel fall back down WHAT??"" To me for 11dollars there should have been more inside just go ahead and buy the bigger size...but it works well"
16041,0,My mother always used Vel soap when I was growing up. I was really excited when I found it for sale.This is a different Vel. The smell is not the same. The soap feels different on the skin. This soap is almost translucent. Vel was a very solid white bar that lasted a long time.The soap is very acceptable--it is just not the product of my memory.
147793,0,I ordered 3 of these items to give as Christmas gifts and I was disappointed when I opened the box and learned that the products delivered were in plastic tubes rather than the glass bottles as pictured in the ad. I doubt if I would have ordered this as gifts if I had know how it was going to be packaged.
24743,2,"Yuck scent. No wonder it was priced so cheaply. But, if you savor heavy orientals, maybe you'll like it. I immediately resold the product on Craig's List at a loss."
4348,2,Bristles fell out within 3 weeks Terrible workmanshipUsed to purchase this but they changed the design Shame.They should of stayed with quality.
114513,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."
165677,1,This is my favorite scent. I ordered the 100 % and thats what I got. I would recommend this product and seller to my friends and family.
73730,0,"I thought I would try this shampoo given the other reviews and my experience with other Kerastase products. This is just okay in my opinion and def not worth the $$$. Using some of the other products, I noticed an immediate difference in my hair, and when I switch back to other types, I still do. I have dry, curly flyaway hair, and this just makes it dull and requires a ton of spray to keep in half way under control. I won't be buying this again."
94528,1,WAS HERE WHEN THEY SAID IT WOULD BE AND IT'S MY FAVORITE PERFUME IN THE WORLD. BAM VERY SATISFIED WITH HOW FAST THE COMPANY PROCESSED MY ORDER AND HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED IT.
162286,0,"I have chosen becouse it was recomanded by my friend.I am satisfied, It is good but not perfect.Yes i would recomend the product if you cannot afford expencive one."
49914,0,"First, I am caucasian with long, thick, fairly wavy/borderline curly hair that has been colored. My hair is healthy but since I am now coloring it, I thought I would try an oil treatment to keep it that way. I used this product with caution because I had read the other reviews that said it washes your color out. So, after applying the product and leaving it in my hair for 45 minutes, I washed my hair out in the sink and I could literally see my hair color coming out in the water (I use Loreal Color Vitamino shampoo that my colorist gave me). The Ojon packaging notes to *not* use this product within 5 days of chemically treating your hair, so I waited a couple of weeks and several washes before using it. Yes, my hair is soft. Yes, the earthy/smoky smell is still in my hair after washing it with shampoo and conditioner (it smells like a pipe, not like cigarettes). And yes, my hair is definitely *lighter* in color than it was before I used this product.So, while it may make your hair feel good....if it then causes you to have to get your hair colored more often, it might not be worth it. I am going to experiment with jojoba oil since my stylist mentioned it's the oil most like that naturally found in your hair."
243089,2,"After months of emergency use simply because my regular skin cleanser wasn't around, I began using Purity regularly. I was not a huge fan to begin with. I thought the consistency was too heavy and creamy for me but since i left my Yves Rocher cream cleanser about 150 miles away, I started using purity a for aweek straight.My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive. This cleanser dried out my face even further filling up and creating wrinkles and a saginess to my face that I NEVER had and I'm only in my mid 20s. I had aged about 10 years after 1 week of this stuff. Horrible! Not only that but it left this residue in my fine lines that not even the best exfoliator and moisturizer can get rid off. After switching back to my old cleanser my skin is once again bright firm and supple."
142941,1,Very good price. It is what me wife uses all the time. Easy to please my wife oor any gift giving day.
204698,0,"I received this kit as a gift. Although I don't have problem skin and don't normally use lots of products, I was psyched to try it out. On day three, I decided to use the microderm peel. The next day my skin was red and irritated and covered with little bumps. I stopped using the whole collection and two weeks later my skin is almost back to normal- I still have dry patches on my cheeks. I'd hate to waste such an expensive product, so I'm gradually working the products back into my daily routine (minus the peel) to see if I break out again. If my skin still goes haywire, I'll go back to using the trusty Phisoderm facewash and St.Ives moisturizer combo that has kept me in near perfect skin."
37126,0,"This iron works well, heats up fast and leaves nice big curls in my hair. The flaw I have noticed, that is really annoying is the control buttons are on the handle right where your hold you hand, so unless you make an effort not to hit the buttons, it is easy to constantly be turing it off and adjusting the temp when you dont want to! I would say that it is possible to find an iron in the same price range that works just as well that doesn't have this problem. I'm not sure why the manufacturer would not think of this...?"
215916,0,"I like the lotion. I have never used her lotion before so wasn't sure how it would smell and/or feel. I like the way it feels, but it has kind of a ""soapy"" smell to me. It goes away after a little while, but the initial smell is a little stronger than I like. I like the way the perfume smells better."
222702,2,"I'm really disappointed when the perfume came in. When i smelled it, i was expecting to smell something with mangos in it. Boy was the description wrong, to me the perfume smells like gardenias, which is going to make me sneeze during the allergy season. And what's even more disappointing is the fact that I can't return it. Yeppy, I'm stuck with this damn thing, woopy-do."
219187,1,I absolutely love this product I have been using it for over two years now. I have really thin hair and I like to spike it. I keep my hair less than two inches and it works great. It lasts all day and washes out easily. It also gives my hair a fuller look because my hair looks dry after applying it. I would not recommend it for people who want the wet look. but for me it works great. It is worth the money being that I probably would spend over 25 dollars a month trying other products that i was just disappointed in. one jar usually lasts me over three months.
159649,2,"After reading the positive reviews for this and other OLAY Reginerist products, I bought it and the Night Resurfacing Elixir. After 2 months of faithful application: Serum in the morning on a clean face; elixir in the evening on a clean face...EVERY day and night for 2 months....absolutely no change in my 51 year old skin. I have a magnifying mirror that showed no change. My jowls did not firm up like the other reviewer's did. My pores are not smaller or tighter. My fine lines are still there if not more evident. I do not smoke or drink alcohol. I take care of my body with healthy eating and lifestyle. I DO NOT RECOMMEND either of these two products."
216363,0,Cheaply made but gets the job done. Bought this because I wanted to thin my hair out myself. It is ok.
124889,2,"I didn't receive the real Poison perfume. My bottle shape is a bit different, it looks similiar to the picture, but is a different bottle. The front does not say ""Christian Dior"", it just says ""Dior"". The smell is very peppery, not even close to the original sweet fragrant scent. I'd never buy from that company again. I wasn't smart enough to keep all the paperwork and return the stuff, I was so excited to receive it, I just pitched box, receipts and all, unfortunately into a dumpster that was emptied right afterward. So I am stuck with this foul smelling bottle of liquid."
236117,0,"My wife likes this perfume, so I started price shopping. This is one of the few items where you want to shop elsewhere. the product is a lot better priced directly from Chanel. Saw one of the sellers on Amazon selling a 1.7 oz ""unboxed"" bottle of Chanel 1.7 oz Eau De Parfum Spray for over $80 claiming a suggested retail of well over $100!Flat out lie. This item is available from the manufacturer for $80 in a box including free shipping. Too bad Amazon lets some of these outfits get away with their lies and phony ""suggested retail"" pricing.JC"
25564,1,"This is an incredible find, it's difficult to find a cologne that is natural and smells like real cologne. This product does both. The smell is pleasant and long lasting, but doesn't overpower. This is absolutely great and it doesn't bother my wife who is sensitive to chemicals."
85531,0,Honestly I don't feel like this is a leave in conditioner with the residue and what not. It just doesn't feel like an actual conditioner. It seems to make my hair somewhat softer but not much. I think it just depends on what type of hair your have and mine is 3c mixed with 4a I think.
11421,2,"I bought this thinking it would be a solution to just using my fingernails to press blackheads out. However the lack of power is so obvious that even after a long hot shower when blackheads are almost popping themselves out it doesn't work. It's the same as doing nothing. It's just ridiculous, apparently was never tested on anyone before releasing."
133759,0,"This elixir smells great and feels nice on the skin, but I guess I just don't understand it's purpose or how it benefits my skin. I won't be repurchasing this product."
203766,1,"I have the Fig, the Tea Tree, and the Sweet Almond Mint. Love all. My suggestion is to check all the facts on his site -- make sure you use plenty! If you don't use enough, it can weigh your hair down. I use about 28 pumps of it on my longish curly hair, and it's fabbo! Soft, manageable, bouncy!!"
45997,2,"This cleanser was gentle, but it didn't clean my skin very well, which led to breakouts. My skin looks worse than before using it, even though I had been using a much harsher cleanser. I wiped my skin with toner after washing with this, both at the sink and in the shower, and more makeup came off on the cotton ball. I'm disappointed; I've heard good things about this line. I may try another."
144479,1,"After I bought this product from Amazon I found out that it's $13 cheaper at BJ's. I like the effect on my skin, but I don't like to know that the ingredients are not all natural."
81978,0,"So I DO know the difference between anti-antiperspirant and deodorant but I have also used some great deodorants that work perfectly in hot humid weather... this is not one of those. While the scent is great when you first spray it on, on a hot day, it does not mix well with regular person perspiration smell, and it's not like I'm a really sweaty and smelly, for the record."
8738,0,When I first used it I had enough hair to make it look good. Now a year later it just looks fake on my hair. It also gives me headaches when I use it and leaves clumps of black.
175182,1,"This is the brand she likes and when one finally fails, which isn't very often, we simply replace it with another one."
205518,2,"yesterday I recived my ""be delicous"" and is FAKE!!!I'm so sad... I bought this from Venezuela, it said ""sold and shipped from amazon"" and I was wating for something real! and it's not!I'm so disappointed!"
28117,1,I buy this for my husband and he looks just fine. Sometimes he uses 2 boxes if it doesn't take. I secretly wonder if he leaves it on long enough the first time......
29094,0,"When I tried this at the store I really liked it so of course bought it. I'm addicted to Auric Blends fragrance so I was excited to add another to my variety of perfume oils. When I got home however, I started to get a headache and I realized that it was the Jasmine oil. It is so strong, and doesn't last very long by itself. I started to experiment mixing it with some of the other ones I have. Egyptian Goddess is my favorite and I refused to mix anything with it before because it is magical all by itself, but mixed with this it enhances the EG and tones this down. I mean a dab of Jasime...like 6 parts Egyptian Goddess one part Jasmine otherwise it overpowers. The way that combination mixes with my body it smells alot like Chanel No 5. Recreation of a $100 perfume for 14 dollars, can't argue with that...It also works nicely with Sandalwood Vanilla and Love, but also with just a dab."
65885,0,THIS PERFUME IS VERY NICE BUT IT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG. THE ONE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON FOR 50% LESS THAN THEY SELL IT IN THE STORES.
119779,1,"This item not only moistens and clears out the nose for easier breathing, at the same time it moistens the face, might as well make use of the whole benefit since it came with the other accessories.I feel it is a good value for what i paid for it."
165643,0,"These are perfectly enjoyable bath salts, but you need to use a lot more of them then I am used to requiring to get a good scent and soft water. This makes the jumbo size much less jumbo, thus less of a good value. The peppermint scent overpowers the tea-tree, but that is not really a problem for me, as I enjoy the minty smell. There are a few small stones in the mix, not really a big deal. I would be happy to use this product again if I find it on sale, but at this price I probably won't buy it again."
32868,1,"This is one of those flights of fancy in which ladies imagine there is a magic that will restore their faces to what they used to be. Never going to happen, but we can dream."
31092,1,"I purchased the mitt and body scrubber a year ago for myself and love the clean feeling I get when I use them. I have traveled quite a bit lately, and take the mitt with me because I don't get the same feeling with any other products! The body scrubber is the greatest back scratcher ever!!!After a year of hanging in my shower, these products still look brand new. They rinse clean and fresh, and have not worn at all.I just purchased several sets as gifts and hope my friends enjoy them as much as I have.Not inexpensive, but worth the price!!"
156356,1,"A great straightner. My only problem is that after a little while my hair begins to get a little wavy again, but overall its great. Heats up fast and my hair feels SUPER SILKY AND SMOOTH after use. The feeling is actually pretty amazing and my hair looks really nice as well."
86435,0,MY SON WHO HAD AN ISSUE WITH BITING HIS NAILS STILL CONTINUED ON AFTER APPLYING THIS. IT DIDNT PHASE HIM AT ALL. MAYBE IT JUST WASNT FOR HIM. THANKFULLY HE HAS STOPPED ON HIS OWN ACCORD.
144850,0,"I ordered 4 bottles of Skin perfume from Parfumes de Coeur, who now makes the product. I think it smells very different than the original Bonne Bell version. So does my husband, who noticed it right away. I am very disappointed, as I still have 3 1/2 bottles to use......"
186513,0,"Please do yourself a favor and don't buy into the hype of this product. Beside the fact that it has mostly natural ingredients, it's no better than any other aveda, or any other natural brand hair products. In fact, I was very put off by the hair dresser at the aveda-certified salon pushing to sell it (her answer to all my hair related question was ""shampure""). Within a day of use, I find that it contributes to residue on my scalp. Honestly, not that impressed."
70990,0,"Nothing wrong with this product, and I know it is loved by many. The truth is, though, that when I use it, I don't get much of a sensation other then that of a cold water splash. I prefer a non-alcoholic after shave balm (check out prorasa pre-post).I am sure this stuff is great if you are a witch hazel fan, I just don't perceive the benefits for myself. I still have an almost full bottle, and I will use it up, so if my opinion changes, I'll edit this in the future."
1652,1,I first experienced this fragrance when I found it in Paris several years ago. It's so beautiful and makes me feel special.
112986,0,I got this hoping it would darken my pre bleached hair to a more golden tone. The color they show here in the picture is extremely off by the way. This color turned my hair brownish gold. Not a dark gold color(deep Gold)Now i have to bleach the crap out of my hair...again and try another color. The picture here shows it looking almost deep red to burgundy. That's not the color of it. I bought this in a store and it didn't look like that. The true color is not true at all during and after application. If you are looking for a deeper gold blondish color you will get brown with this. It shouldn't even be considered a blonde color at all. I am very disappointed and pissed that i have to subject my already damaged hair to another bleach application to get it out and start over again.
140086,0,"This is an OK product, it does its job but not well. The only problem this has is the fact that it gets transferred to things too easily, especially water! If you wash your face with this on your nails its going to come off on your face and you wont realise it until you lick your lips and realise the horrid bitter taste is somewhere its not suppose to be. If that is fixed this would be perfect."
224274,0,"I bought this straightener as a temporary replacement on a trip. I must say you get what you pay for. I have to use a liberal amount of John Freida Secret Weapon and Chi Silk Infusion when I use this straightener (using it wet or dry, it always needs a good amount of product to look well).The plates are somewhat cheap and are more ceramic than tourmaline, It might scratch up your hair.The plates WILL scratch up against each other at a minimum.The plates also have tiny gaps in the slots the are in so at a certain angle your hair might get snagged in them.Not bad for 20ish bucks though.Just a good temporary replacement or perhaps ""daughter's first straightener""."
189405,2,Nothing really special about this product. It's really gentle on your skin; so gentle that I question whether it's even doing anything. It doesn't even create suds/bubble. It smells nice though and I don't see a difference in the quality of my facial skin. I wouldn't recommend this as a daily face wash/cleanser but give it 2 stars because I support the fight against prostate cancer and I feel it would better suited someone who is Glycolic-ly informed.
205257,2,"I had been using Eucerin Skin Renewal Lotion for about 3 years whenit suddenly became unavailable. I tried this lotion and started having flaky, dry skin immediately."
175256,1,I am 70 yrs. old and can do only l/2 of the video a day. I like Bev's personality and would recommend it for moderately active people 50 or above.
168034,1,This color looks just like it was pictured! I have been looking for this color for a long time and i finally found it! It also came earlier than i expected! it came within 3 days! I love this color. And i would buy again! Would recommed it to everyone! Buy it! It's a great deal for your money.
137611,0,"I got it as a gift and while I would like it as a darker pink like the photo, it's a really bright hot pink. It is streaky, so you have to wear 2-3 coats. It's a cute summer color"

236917,1,"I have been using the mama mio tummy rub stretch mark oil since I was in my third month of pregnancy. My belly is huge but I'm happy to say that I have no stretch marks! I use it twice a day and sometimes add the mama mio butter as well. I use a lot so one bottle only lasts about a month and a half. I highly recommend this product.Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil, 4.1 fl oz, prevent stretch marks, safe for pregnancy"
166518,1,"I have been using Spring Rain Bath & Shower gel as a bubble bath for maybe 20 years. I can no longer find it at Crabtree & Evelyn stores, so I order it online. I just hope it is never discontinued....that will make me so sad."
84374,2,"The reason this store sells testers so cheaply is because the fill level is as low as half full. You're better off buying a regular bottle from any of other discounter or full price store.Nowhere on their website is ""low fill"" defined. If you call the store, they claim ""low fill"" means the bottle is actually 100% filled... it just doesn't ""look"" that way when it reaches you... Right."
30858,0,i though i would like it and i do but the smell is not that fantastic so make sure you know what it smells like before you buy it
113007,2,"Good morning, I regret to inform you that this article was mistakenly delivered to another person and never received it. This is why I can not deliver an opinion on the matter ...I imagine that the hair dryer is very good, so try to buy it but never came to my hands ...Isa&iacute;as Aguilar"
130898,2,"Horrible, bottle was tampered with. Smells nothing like how it should. I have perchased this perfume for years and make no mistake this is not it! It's a fake or been dilluted."
241894,1,"I love this gel. all I have to do is dab a little on and it'll hold really well. The following day, I re-moisten my hair with a spritz of water/Apple Cider vinegar/glycerin, and the gel that I've already put in my hair essentially re-activates, and I can go over that process for about a week.The ingredients are mostly organic, have no icky 'parabens or chemicals, and is all vegetarian."
81457,0,Still back ordered...so we will see. Good lord...it is a scrubby for the shower and I don't have it yet.
226834,0,"This stuff is waterproof for real. It doesn't sting my eyes, all others do sting. My friends are always telling me how red my eyes are. It is skin color. It does not dry clear, and it is the only sunscreen to give me zits. It is so uncomfortable that I cannot wait to get it off after I get out of the water. It turns my wash rag skin color. It's the most effective sunscreen I have tried, and I've tried most."
191398,0,"Would have given this 5 stars, but it contains parabens. It works great on my daughters hair, but I will discontinue using it due to the parabens."
78245,0,"On me, Heaven Sent is a predominately citrus & rose scent that is buttressed by patchouli and oakmoss. This is not a virginal fragrance for little girls! I guess I am lucky that I don't know what the original Heaven Sent smells like. This version from 2001 is gorgeous on me!Granted, Heaven Sent EdP is very light and close-wearing. However, it is in-step with today's rose trends yet patchy & mossy for those with classic tastes. In a stronger formula, I think fumies would be gaga for this one, and it strikes me that it would be edgy enough to come from JHAG and classic enough to come from Gres. However, in this weak formula, it is still a wonderful bedtime scent, or possibly one to wear when working in close quarters with others.I'm loving it and will wear it for restful, dreamy nighttimes ... smelling lovely and not suffocating my partner.PS - The original is not from Dana. This is not supposed to smell like it!PSS - Heaven Sent is a cheap substitute for modern L'Heure Bleue."
216952,2,"Good afternoon, mistakenly put a wrong data in the direction of my order that appears delivered. According to U.S. laws any package that does not correspond to the person you get in the error should be returned to the company. What could be done in this case?>>>> Thanks"
225492,0,"This product does not last long, keep that in mind if you have past shoulder length hair. Worked well for a few weeks and eventually the bristles started to bend."
63798,0,"This fragrance smells nice, but it's one of those scents that an older, mature/sophisticated woman would wear. My sister and I both thought it probably won't appeal to young girls. I gave it a three star because I don't think it fits me either, but my sister loved it!"
30014,2,"I couldn't find any difference in the amount of dandruff at all. I went through the entire bottle used as directed and there was 0 change. Every person is different but this was a waste of money for me. Luckily, Selsun Blue (the medicated one) worked in ONE treatment."
154459,1,"This is a great sponge! To begin with, it does leave your face looking very dewy and airbrush like. It's not like other cheap alternatives ones because 1. doesn't feel the same and 2. when both wet this sponge absorbs less 3. This reaches and is good for corners and edges. I tested this sponge to see how much it absorbed of my foundation AFTER I got it wet and squeezed out the excess water and to my surprise it was very little. I really like this because I can get a better look with cheaper foundations. I use the bottom big part of the egg when im done applying my makeup with the egg to get any excess out and im done!"
227273,0,"So far I have had a very unusual experience. I had it on for about 3 months an the scar without a doubt got better over time, and definitely lowered the bump as well. Then one day I noticed a small opening in the wound, and every time I took the pad off there was a small amount of puss. In fear of infection I called Cica Care and they said they never heard of this before and to remove it immediately and wait for it to close up, they said after that I can try it again but if for some reason it happens again to take it off. I will update this review at a later date."
221064,0,"This product is ok but I find it does not hold the moisture in my hair as I had read about after moisturizing my hair. Though I love the larger size of this oil the biggest disappointment is most of the oil leaks from the bottle and the lid does not stay securely closed. The first day of use I took the oil to work and by the time I got there a fourth of the bottle had leaked in my bag and that happen a couple of times. So when I need to travel with it I have to wrap the top with something and bind it down to keep the lid from leaking or opening. It was truly disappointing after spending all that money for it and still not get the results I was totally hoping for. I would still recommend this produce because where it may not have worked on my hair as I thought it would, does not mean it would not do better on some else hair. Mybe I got a defective bottle and maybe this won't happpen with another but be cautous because that oil will be on everything making a big mess."
8154,0,"don't get me wrong...this iron works well at straightening your hair and it gets REALLY hot. However, it only served me for about a year, if that long. Last week, I went to turn it on, and ten minutes later the plates were still cold. I dont know what happened, because it was not dropped, the outlets were fine, and it showed no signs of wear. I was displeased with its short life span, because when you spend 40 bucks on something, you expect it to last more than a year."
16300,0,"so, I read online that this mask was amazing. it may well be, if I could just get it to come out of the package correctly. maybe my packaging was just flawed, but i couldnt get the outer goop to come out.i didnt think it was that great, but maybe that was because i didnt have the correct mixture...oh well."

178829,2,total waste of my money. should have heeded the earlier reviews. clogged after 1st use. don't waste your money. product was worthless. pale powder doesn't work on dark hair... if you can get it to spray after the initial use.
159079,0,"I have two Remington Clippers... the other is HC-363 model. This one gets a lower grade mark from me than my HC 363 because after 10-15 minutes of use, the blades become HOT due to the self sharping feature. Normally, I would cut my hair first then afterwards line up the edges. By the time I start my lining the blades are hot and irriate my skin, so with these clippers I line first then cut the main area. I cut my own hair, and the cord can be a nuisance when directing certain angle cuts. An CORDLESS feature, such as my HC 363, void this issue. Otherwise, these clippers give a clean cut, are very quiet, and have enough assesories included. I did not break any of my guides though. I suggest taking you time when installing these guides, and use minimal pressure... they are plastic. I only marked 3 stars because I cut my own hair, CORDLESS is a plus, Ceramic blades (HC 363 model) are better than metal blades, and the blade heat after 10 or mintues is uncomfortable. If you cut other people's hair then I would advise you about the blades getting too hot while cutting."
165778,2,This product is way over priced you are paying for 1oz size what other sites charge for the 3.4 oz size... very disapointed will send back ASAP
113259,2,"At first it worked well, but it slowly started not heating up as much until it failed less than a year later. I expected it to last longer than it did at this price. I've paid less and they lasted a lot longer."
225434,0,This curling iron has some design defects that make it difficult to use. The control buttons for on off and temperature are located on the handle right under the spring loaded clamp. I have shut it off inadvertently and also changed the temperature by accident. It is frustrating when I am in a hurry as I constantly have to revue the setting to make sure they are where they have to be for optimal use.
137867,2,"Hello,That was my first time buying Murrays and by the reviews I decided to try however when I use the product on my hair it felt like I was using candle wax I could not remove the product easily from my hair it took me 6 consecutive washes to remove it and to be honest i still feel that I have some as I said I don't believe they should have this product for all hair types."
184209,1,"China Glaze delivers again. Excellent formula, quick drying time and an outstanding color. Bogie is a smoky purple that, while labeled as a frost, appears more like a metallic minus the brushstrokes.Stunning and a worthwhile purchase for fans of polish."
42532,2,I purchased both the Revlon lipliner in NUDE the Revlon #070 NUDE Lipstick.Both are aweful. Don;t waste you good money on the Nude SHADES.
180008,0,"Love the color, but it dries matte. It's not a matte polish. So I don't know what is wrong with that."
238120,2,"This is VERY quiet but i feel it compromised the power. If you looking for a quick blow dry, forget it, this thing takes forever. And the cord is way too short for me! Not satisfied."
221878,0,"Don't be fooled like I was. I needed a flat iron that I could use in Europe, and I bought this because the product description says ""Auto off-dual voltage."" Not true; I'm returning it. I hope Amazon corrects this error."
228857,2,"To be very honest, I would have no idea if the product its self is a good product or not, because the selling description with it, was not made clear enough for a man shopping for a woman, this item is not complete, and needs an additional product in order to be used. Enlarge of the presented photo also did nothing towards making that clear for the consumer. Bascially my family member, has an item that can't be used unless or untill we can find the other part needed to complete use of this item. My advise is, and suggestion, is to be able to ask a question of the seller of the item's for more complete information. Just my honest opinion."
183018,2,"i wanted to do an at home french manicure so i bought this. when i went to file my nail, my nail made sliced into the side of it. it did smooth the top of my nail, but i was still upset that i had to use another filer to shape my nails. i previously bought one of another brand that was much better and was dissapointed with this one."

44949,2,"This was a Christmas Gift that was scheduled to deliver Dec. 22nd. I have Never recieved it.Tracking pacage says that it is on the truck for delivery ever since Dec.22nd. UPS says that they can't help me, that Amazon has to request help. Problem is that I can'nt get hold of anyone at Amazon to help me. This is the last time that I purchase from them!!!!"
167681,2,who would know if this stuff works... it stinks so bad you have to shower before it has a chance.
29222,0,"Smells like carnations to me (love that scent!) but dries down to a sweet, candy smell, but not rich enough like I would prefer. It's nice - but I won't continue to wear it."
60812,0,My friend really liked this gift. It came quickly even though it was ordered around Christmas time.
221118,1,I use this in my dc treatment. It has lasted me for almost 2 months now and I have not had to buy replacement. So whenever I need another 1 I will be purchasing this again.
19827,0,Purchased product for wife. She said it was a little watery than usual but ok. I would not purchase online again.
1029,0,"This product didn't work as well as my own hair drier and brush. It certainly didn't dry my thick hair nor did it straighten or smooth it. It took an hour to do what I do with my usual method in twenty minutes, and my hair did not look good at all. Another item to take us drawer space . . ."
113721,1,"This is a 5 star scent, but it gets 1 star for longevity. Upon initial application, it smells wonderful - the citrus is very light and sweet. But sniff quickly - it begins to fade to nothingness quickly. If you want a fruity citrus scent to last for a while, look elsewhere (Chanel, Hermes, etc.). But for the short while it lasts, it is quite nice.Clinique should really consider making a loner lasting EdP version of this - I would certainly consider getting a bottle of that. But this one, while I dont regret owning it, I would not re-purchase."
191702,0,I love this product but the spray function has always been challenging; however the supplier was outstanding & handled a problem in such a manner that I would definitely order from them in the future.
242863,1,I received a sample of this when I purchased another item and loved it so much had to buy the bottle. It's well worth the price and keeps my skin soft and clear.
39455,0,GOOD PRODUCT FOR A NORMAL HAIR. MINE IS KIND OF DRY SO IT LEAVES MY HAIR A BIT UNMANAGEABLE...WITHOUT A GOOD CONDITIONER I WILL SAY DONT USE THIS IF YOUR HAIR IS DRY OR WITH ANY CHEMICAL TREATMENT.
45866,0,"This is a good shampoo, but don't expect your hair to grow back. Even Nioxin claims on its bottle as ""9 out of 10 people perceived increase in hair density.."". The keyword is ""Perceive"".. If you want to ""perceive"" that your hair is regrowing or thickening, this is your product. Otherwise, this is another expensive shampoo..FYI- I've tried, Nioxin system 1 and 2 shampoo & conditioner (6+ months), Nioxin vitamins (6+months), and the liquid treatment for 3+ months. My hair feels soft and clean, but no result. I did ""PERCEIVE"" that my hair density increased, but no regrowth. Use Head & shoulders thickening shampoo for $2.99 instead of wasting money like me."
26108,1,I use this product all the time to cover the gray roots between hair colorings. It's easy to apply and does a great job of blending in well with my natural hair color. This is a perfect solution for me to stretch out the hair color process several weeks and I can still look my best. I was pleased to find this larger size and great price on Amazon.
177057,2,"I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.WRONG! IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin. My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product. I even tried the ""gel"" version, thinking maybe the cream was a bit too heavy for my skin.But no - save your hard earned cash - the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice."
56161,1,"Ive used Lovely since it first came out and love it. I bought this before my last bottle ran out, following my &#34;be prepared&#34; rule."
57265,1,"This is my second pregnancy and I just purchased 5 bottles because with my first pregnancy it really worked. My mom has terrible stretch marks and I got them during puberty around my thighs and butt so when I became pregnant I thought that I was destined to get stretch marks all over my stomach like my mom but I was not willing to give up that easy I thought I am going to fight this. So as soon as I found out I was pregnant I started using Bella B tummy butter twice a day at morning and night. I would apply it all over breasts, tummy, and thighs and butt. I was very sensitive to odors but found this one to have a very light scent. I always wore an undershirt to prevent the oils from rubbing off on my clothes. It never stained my undershirts but I felt more comfortable that way. I did not begin to show till I was about 3-4 months pregnant and I think it really helped by preparing my body for what was to come. During my pregnancy I gained nearly 40 pounds and did not get one stretch mark. I really believe in this product but you have to dedicate yourself to use it as often as you can. Good luck!"
65228,2,"When I bought these two bottles of J Lo Glow I believe they were about $15 less (each) than what I pay in stores, which is GREAT! Almost like 2 for 1. The perfume smelled like Glow but for some reason the scent wasn't as strong, & did not last all day like Glow normally does for me. In addition, the whole time I used these bottles I didn't get the usual compliments to my scent that I always get from everyone (male & female - they like the Glow plus the hair stuff I use). Once I went back to store-bought J Lo Glow, the compliments returned. All is normal again. :)"
185079,0,"I use this for haircuts. I have thick, coarse hair, and I use the one-inch guard for my whole head, then do a couple of swipes with a shorter guard around my ears. The trimmer cuts well, but my unit died the second time I used it."
166198,0,"smells and looks like toothpaste~ cool on face but a little dry, haven' t seen significant effect so far, but worthy at this price"
209732,2,This is not the real deal....trust me it is FAKE ...made in Bance instead of france and it is not the same product...dont buy this
172578,0,"This product is easy to use. It comes with everything you need to get the job done: color, plastic gloves and a post-color conditioner. I have a substantial amount of grey hair and this product covers them evenly and completely. The color lasted for 3-1/2 weeks before I started to see grey hairs coming back. As a word of caution, the color is unpredictable. There are photos on the box that show how the color will turn out (factoring in what color your hair currently is), but these depictions are not at all close to my results. I have dark brown hair and was hoping to lighten it to a dark blonde. I ended up with dark auburn. No hint of blonde whatsoever. People have commented that I have red highlights."
923,1,"When I first saw this product I thought its probably the same as the others I have tried and wasted my money on. But when I frist used the Infiniti I really was so pleased. I have shoulder lenght curly, frizzy hair and I needed something like this just to comb through my hair and dry it. This really did the job. It didn't straighten my hair like it says it does,but it did smooth my friz out and makes my hair look healthy. I really am glad I got the Infiniti."
163038,0,"This stuff does an okay job of clearing up your skin but it takes a few days. It's not a one-time-use miracle cream. (see: Benzoyl Peroxide) and it smells AWFUL. I get self conscious whenever I wear the stuff because I'm afraid someone might be able to smell it on me, that's how bad it is.I'd say this is good for if you're skin is starting to flare up and you're going to be spending the day at home and want to treat it."
121037,0,"The smell is excellent. It smells very vanilla-y. I read that a lot of people get complements on this fragrance, but I don't see how this is possible. After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone. It has no staying power at all."
41494,0,"I received the product in record time, however the product itself does straighten hair somewhat, but does not take out the frizz which is what I was looking for."
238693,1,"This is definitely one of the undisputed champ of all colognes. While its does smell great and gain much attention from women, most of every guy out there has it. That in itself would be the only drawback since you'll just smell like everyone else. And many times people remember others by the way they smell, not always by looks."
1443,0,"These towels I didn't find as good as the original Tan Towel; but for a quick touch up, they are okay. I'm of asian decent and the Comodynes kind of came up a bit on the orange side for me and there was streaking. Self tanning lotions/towels will have different affects on everyone. The color depends on your skin type and natural color. Make sure you apply to dry, clean, exfoliated skin."
112672,1,Great quality - just as described. FYI - Comes out a little darker on the nails.
57516,0,Received on Time but the item was damaged --returned and got a new setNext time i will not purchase Bars from Amazon.Its easy to purchase from store
251092,2,"I really wanted to like this scrub, especially with all the positive reviews (and not just on amazon), but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it (and weirdly only on the entire left side of my face). I'm not sure which ingredient caused it, but just wanted to write this review so people know to test it out first to make sure they don't have an allergic reaction to it too. I did give it to my mom to try it so I'll try to remember to update this with her thoughts on it."
38266,0,"It was hard to find a good shade of Red. When I used it, I was a little disappointed, as the color WILL rub off on your Pillow Case. Also,it was difficult to apply to the Temple areas without getting the product on your face. Perhaps if it was slanted at the end, it would help the application?"
142373,2,"I try just about every new fangled skin/makeup/cleanser, and I definitely gave these guys a fair shot...The shot went foul...It left a film on my skin that felt like I had put an anti-frizz hair product on my face by accident...I smells awful too...I was bad enough that after a week of use, my husband finally asked me if I was coming down with something and covering it up with makeup!Don't believe the hype!This stuff is shimmery crud!"
52094,1,"Much better than Sumo Wax, Sumo Tech is softer and less greasy. It holds without being stiff. Just a smidgen of this pulled through short hair gives texture and a light hold with very little weight.Perfect."
170259,1,This is a gorgeous polish that far exceeded my already high expectations. This China Glaze polish has an amazing consistency and the small gold flecks make this pretty pink color gorgeous. It's a mature pink that is perfect for fingers or toes anytime of the year.
125632,2,This is the yellow shea butter thats sold in those oriental shops for a cheap pricing. The product is okay not the better quality or grade of shea butters. I assumed this would of been the white shea butter and more solid. This has a very yellow coloring and a overly strong scent.
238561,2,This dryer was only a few months old and it started to smell like it was burning up. The handle would get so hot you couldn't hold the dryer. What a waste of money. I threw the dryer out because it was a hazard!
161244,2,"Although this hair dryer worked fine to dry my hair, the retractable cord button kept getting ""stuck"" and wouldn't retract the cord. Amazon was very accommodating to the problem and immediately sent me a second dryer. Incredibly, the second dryer had the same problem! I am returning both of them - very disappointed. I love the idea of a retractable cord - might try a different brand!"
166674,1,"I love this product. It shows exactly where it will develop on your skin so you will not be surprised when it does form and you can rub in streak marks before its too late. It comes with a pair of gloves to prevent your hands from getting dark. It is the best self tanning lotion to me because it is so dark and natural looking. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can only really use it right before you go to bed and it will show on your sheets, however it will come out in the washer. The reason I do no use it during the day is because it does smell a little if you have it on during work or something and its that starchy smell. The shipping of this product was SUPER quick. Aside from only being able to wear it during the nighttime, I love it and continue to use it because of the results I get from it."
43207,0,The keeper tabs are the little tips that raise from the area of the finger nail file.They are two little tabs that rise from each side of the finger nail file The keep the top lever from sliding around when the clippers are closed. This setup does not have them at all never even planed for them. I liked the old style better.dray
251654,1,"Cons: I have only one complaint about ""Image""; The scent does not last as long as other scents I use. I like a perfume that lasts longer than a few hours.Pros: The scent is clean, fresh and really quite lovely."
202949,0,"THe product smells good and after drying it holds together and pulls off as one sheet without lots of tearing. I didn't notice any significant difference after using it. It didn't pull out a lot of stuff from my face and I especially was hoping it would clean up my nose. Overall my skin is pretty good though, so that could be why there wasn't a dramatic affect. I also have only used it once so far and it may need several usages to prove itself."
189497,2,works fine to soften dry under eye skin but doesnt help either puffiness or dark circles. any lotion could do the same thing. not worth the money!
65299,0,"I am glad this product already got two good reviews, because that will balance out what I am going to say. ""WHERE'S THE BEEF?"" (Does anyone remember that burger commercial.....maybe I am getting old.) Maybe I need to say, for this product, ""where's the BEADS?"" Sorry, but 5 or 6 little beads per face-wash is not my idea of an exfoliant, so I feel deceived that this was specifically labeled and promoted as an exfolient. The cream is a bit thick and hard to wash off. Otherwise, it is a fine face-wash and I will be using it for good long time since my mother sent me 2 big tubes of it, not knowing that I had already bought one, so now I have 3. I will alternate with a 'real' exfolient once a week, such as Nivea/Visage Gentle Cleansing Cream."
13632,0,"First of all, I love to use Goldwell Ultra Rich Conditioner to treat my hair. This product restores vibrant health to even the most deeply damaged hair and sets the hair back to its original stage. It dramatically helps increas strength against breakage. Normally, after 2-3 treatment, my hair has a shiny healthy look. My hair was never soft but this product give my hair a sleek look that I don't have to spend time to straight or style except comb my hair in the morning after shower.Second, a small bottle goes a long way. My previous 1 liter bottle last a very very long time. I don't know if they have expiration date but after a year, the quality of the product still very good.I was disappointed for my recent purchase from ASAP Beauty. The conditioner came out very watery and it doesn't have the magic effect on my hair any more. My hair went puffy and curly at the second day after the treatment.I am not sure if the company changed its formula or just something wrong with this bottle but I will give the product another try from a different seller."
232788,2,"I bought this based on the reviews. VERY unimpressed. I touch up chips twice a day! I usually use OPI, which will last two weeks with minimal maintenance. This didn't make it 3 days. The colors are pretty, but even Sally Hanson outlasts Essie, and at a third the price. My first bottle will be my last bottle."
219610,2,"I have had the scunci brand of this product before (it was 15.00 about 6 years ago) and was looking for a second so i could wash the first more frequently. Yes, the other brand was so good i hated to wash it for fear of it not being there after my shower and in the dryer instead :-). So I bought this product at a local dollar store - and was absolutely dissapointed. I have medium to long length hair and it doesn't all fit into this Turban and my hair is still sopping wet after using this one - whether it was the part of my hair in the turban or not. This is certainly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". A big thumbs up for hair drying turbans 5 big thumbs down for this brand."
138793,2,"Length:: 0:24 MinsI received this hair iron yesterday and use in the yesterday evening, guess what..it burn my hair right off.I feel so upset about it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GSAM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
218187,1,"Against my better judgement (too many Billy Mays mishaps) I ordered Frequensea. I've been taking it now for about four days, and I have to say the differences I feel are subtle, but well worth the cost of the product. So far, the quality of my sleep has improved- I sleep deeply, and I get up a little earlier than I normally have been- and feel great when I get up! My energy is overall improved- I don't get bursts of energy when I drink Frequensea, however throughout the day I don't get that rundown feeling. We'll see what else comes after prolonged use! So far, I'm happy!"
225409,2,"The vents under the brush attachments blow hot air out. It's no problem for the piece of hair you're trying to curl, but it messes up the sections of hair around it by blowing them around into a mess. It's hard to get a polished look when the hot air brush is making a mess out of all of the hair you just styled."
47923,1,"I normally use a clay dry shampoo, which I like better, but this gets the job done. I normally only wash my hair every three days (unless I sweat) and no one knows unless tell them. Dry shampoo takes away the greese and give your hair lift. It is damaging to your hair to wash it every day so this is a good alternative. This works almost as good as my normal clay dry shampoo. It is defianately worth it if you like dry shampoo and are traveling. Small size is perfect for those long international flights."
247402,0,The green nail polish looked very bright and opaque on amazon. I thought it would be cute under OPI's black shatter. So I bought it and it turned out looking like marker on my nails. I had to layer like 4 or 5 coats and it still wasn't the true color. A bit disappointing and not very opaque. The color isn't a bright once you do 4 or 5 coats but it doesn't look as much like marker.
13532,0,"I would normally give this lotion 5 stars but for two things I can't. For one it's to greasy and secondly the aroma or should I say smell is not pleasant at all. Otherwise it does a good job of tanning, you just have to deal with those flaws. JMHO"
161990,0,"I'm only giving this item 3 stars because the night light does not work. My contractor installed it for me; however, as far as the hair dryer itself ggoes, I'd give it 5 stars! Every woman should have this one in her bathroom, It's handy, neat because of the cord storage, snd really works fine. I'm hoping by the time I have my other bath done, it will be made in beige. I like to co-ordinate my colors."
161360,0,"I'm a little disappointed, Andis.I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
143234,1,"It's hard to know if this really works, but it certainly isn't hurting. I will keep using it and see. There really isn't a good clinical trial that I can present, but all I can say is that no one has said, ""What is that stink?"" Other than that, it does seem people react better to me, but how much of that is real I just can't quantify."
201787,0,Nice nail color however chips by day 6.. Right price but overpriced for shipping. I purchased another nail color from them at the same time. I got two shipping charges when both nailpollishes come in the same $3 shipping/us postage paid envelope ! I paid $12 in shipping. What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
54162,0,"The smart clips that came with these rollers are not in the least bit user friendly. I found them impossible to use. The rollers themselves do heat up very quickly, but they get too hot. I tried to use the smart clips and the new rollers for a week but then gave up. I returned to my very old Conair Travel set of 5 Jumbo rollers with my old fashioned metal clips. My new rollers have disappeared into the cabinet underneath my wash basin!"
43221,0,"I found the Revlon Eyelash Curler a little hard to use, but once I figured it out, the results were very nice. If a friend was in the market for an eyelash curler, I'd recommend this one. It gives good results and is easy to use, once I figured it out."
19510,0,"I actually liked the make-up, but I started breaking out and my face would sweat a lot and burn. Turns out I am allergic to bismuth oxychloride like many other people are. Also, this ingredient makes your face look more shiny, thus the need for the mineral veil. There are many other mineral make-ups out there that do not contain bismuth oxychloride. I can still use the eyeshadows and eyeliner."
212627,2,My box did not have the derma seal sticker which makes me very uncomfortable in the validity of this item...
174704,1,"This is my personal fragrance. I love this perfume, its so light and refreshing and its lasts long on you. I always get complements on this fragrance. I will always buy atleast two bottles and keep it so i will never run out of it. You will definitely enjoy this scent."
225770,0,"I received this product in the mail today and was quite disappointed with the size of the item. It's very tiny for the semi-expensive price of it. Also, it does not really smell much like banana. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it smells more accurately like Lemon PEZ. However, one good thing about this is that it works great in the shower. It creates a nice, rich lather on a loofah and leaves a fresh scent, even after washing it off. I will probably not purchase this item again but it's alright."
173642,0,"Not sure why this has happened but my orignial and smaller bottle of Nixon 3 Cleanser (10.0 fl. oz)was made in the U.S.A. while this larger (33.8 fl. oz.) size is made in Mexico.The small bottle's first 5 ingredients: water, tea-lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, cocoamido-propyl betaine.Now it is has changed to: water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, citric acid, sodium citrate.I'm not a chemist but, it certainly appears to be less natural without the tea and coco ingredients.Changes have been made to the formula structure and I'm not sure if it is a better formula or a cost saving measure.I'll give it try to see if it continues to be useful."
126907,0,"I first purchased this product at a shop in the Caribbean, when I needed a general-use body cream. I loved the scent of this olive oil product, and it is easily absorbed into the skin. I've since switched to another olive oil product, however, due to the parabens and other chemicals found in this body butter. It does not purport to be paraben-free or organic, however, so there's no misrepresentation. It was the creamiest, most nicely scented of the body butters I've tried."
184684,0,"didn't work for the reason i purchased it, keep ants away, but it smells just as nice i remember it did (we used it for mosquito repellant in the south!) product was a good price & arrived promptly."
79477,1,I was thrilled with the size of the lotion. It was much larger than I anticipated. Love the product. I received it very timely and I quite satisified with the purchase.
201680,2,"I found the consistency of the product to be a bit tricky to spread properly. After application, I found it had a blotchy effect. Perhaps it is not meant for my skin type and tone? I'm happy I tried it out, but would not vouch for it to work for everyone."
78362,0,"I used this product purchased from local supermarket and it worked great. I have been making my own hair dye from pure henna and indigo powder and it worked very well, except for the preparation of the mix, which is very time-comsuming and also I had to leave it on my hair for at least 4 hours. I don't like commercial hair color because they contain ammonia, peroxide, and PPD.This product is very convenient. No more time-consuming mixing and waiting 12 hours for the mixture to release the dye, no more stuck at home for 4 hours for the dye to work. and it covers the gray better than my own henna. However, the product I purchased from this vendor has LOTS of solid bits in it. I don't know why it's different than the ones I bought from the store which is all liquid cream. It still works fine, but I don't like that it is full of color solid bits, and it stains my counter and floor. I will still use this product but I would try other vendor, or just buy directly from the local store."
60450,1,Color reminds me of fuschia a deep rich pink. Color goes on smoothly. It is exactly what I was expecting tried the color in a salon prior to buying. I love Essie products
81808,0,"I love pink sugar Aqualina so I ordered it at a good price from Amazon. I noticed by the third day the spray pump was mal-functioning and it does not spray properly. Well, that was a waste of money.Again - the product if working properly is awesome. This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon."
207965,0,DON'T THINK I WILL ORDER AGAIN ONLY BECAUSE IT IS MADE WITH MINERAL OIL I MIX IT WITH MY OTHER OILS FOR NOW
196703,0,"I have thick hair. This product is OK, but I'm not overly impressed. I've tried others and this is definitely better than products you would find at Wal-mart or the grocery store and the price isn't too bad. I feel like it takes forever to straighten my hair with this and it's still not as flat/unfrizzy as I would like it to be. Oh well, it will work for now."
205226,1,Love the soap. LOVE the box!!! Great presentation and quality. SPEEDY shipping!
231997,2,"I have used Alpha Hydrox Souffle and other Alpha Hydrox products for the last 15 years. It is an incredible product. In the past year it has become unavailable at our local Rite Aid and Walgreens up here in the boonies of upstate NY. I have tried other products, Loreal, Olay, and others and nothing produces results like this product for my skin.I decided to try buying it on line and placed my order. It promptly arrived 4 days later and I ran to the sink to clean my face and start my face routine. When I opened the jar it was nearly empty and so dried out it was not spreadable. I'd say the jar had a half inch of product if lucky. You could see where it had dehydrated back to the glass and just plain dried out and shrunk. This WAS NOT THE FLUFFY SOUFFLE I was used to. I opened the second jar I ordered, same thing!First off, I am wondering if this product is being made any more as it is no longer available in the major chains up here in Northern NY as well as in the greater Boston area. Did I get some dried up old inventory sold off to a schlock vendor? I hope not but it would appear to be. The jars have a serial number that starts with 2005. I called the toll free line of Neuterics listed on the jar and got the classic pick a number routine. I was able to leave a number for them to call me back. If they do and make good on their product I will run to rewrite this review. For now, consider it fabulous product, horrible service, and what good is it if it is a dried up 1/4 filled jar? Don't spend your money here until we know. I am dating this review 04/02/10 and if you don't see my correction for improved customer service, stay away. In this econonomy, who has money to waste?"
38834,1,It has a pleasant raspberry scent after a few minutes of being on your skin
107691,1,"Still excited about the bargain I got! Perfume was in perfect condition and is as good as I had expected, fast shipping. Overall great order!"
190371,1,"I've seen these mirrors in hotels or TV and always thought they looked so nice and fancy for a bathroom.When I looked online recently, I was finding them for over $100 and I just couldn't bring myself to buy one. I found this on Amazon and for the price, I couldn't resist.I was afraid it would feel flimsy or cheap, but it wasn't!This was easy to mount and looks and feels fantastic. I use it nearly everyday and I have recommended this to everyone already who sees it in my bathroom!"
57172,1,"I love this product! In fact I use it all over since I am so fair, and it gives me a subtle glow without looking orange like most self-tanners make me look. The smell disappears as soon as it dries (which only takes a few minutes)."
176356,0,"I really loved the smell of this perfume for the first few hours. It's very sweet, light and lovely in the beginning. After a while it leaves a very strong woody, patchouli scent and I'm left wanting the sweet back."
191126,1,"I normally use a tinted wax to keep my brows in place. It works but it's not as great as I'd like. I've been using this brow mousse after my tinted brow wax and brow powder and it keeps my brows in place much better than just my wax. It also doesn't flake or get goopy.Could the applicator be better? Yes. I usually have to dip the brush back in 3 or 4 times to get enough on my brows. But the product does hold, which is why I bought it.I'd buy it again but would wait for it to be majorly discounted before I did."
143524,2,"I used cuticle clippers, and though I would try these. No comparison. Does a sloppy job, cuts cuticle uneven and hard to get accuracy around the edge of the nail bed. These will have a short life, cause I don't like these."
41746,1,Love love love this color! Great product & high quality polish! Seems to last longer than most! Love it a lot!
128613,1,"It isn't horribly overwhelming like most women's fragrances. It does have an initial punch, but after a minute or so, it is a light, subtle scent. I usually use 1/2 - one spray and no more than that. It is not necessary.I used this when I was a young teenager, but had a hard time finding it when I moved. My mother recently picked up a bottle for me on a cruise to Jamaica. After using it for the first time in about 16-17 years, I had a huge rush of good memories. I'm happy to have a bottle of this again."
18428,0,my wife using it or maybe 4 nights. but she complaint the pain on her face drying up and panicked!!!! she immediately brought face lotion or something like that to reverse the effects.
219649,0,"and it's ok. I noticed one little patch of eczema I had is gone and it lathers well. .but it also kinda leaves you skin with that ""tight-soap"" feeling. . especially if you've used Dove other soaps feel like ""soap.""..but it was worth a shot."
96030,0,"I was very excited to try this product, it seemed to get rave reviews everywhere I looked, so I was more than happy to pay such an expensive price because I was expecting to see it work.Since I've bought it I've attempted using it a few times in a few different settings, and nothing really seems to occur differently than usual. I even put it on around my boyfriend of two years and he still acted the same way.Much to my disappointment, it really seems like nothing more than an overly expensive nice smelling roll on perfume.It has a nice flowery scent, but as far as the dosage of Pheromones goes, it doesn't seem like enough to give the effect so many people rave about."
22037,1,"I've bought a lot of stuff over the years that claimed to do one thing or another and it ended up being a total waste of money. This however, is some of the best money I've ever spent. I bought one about 10 years ago and I'm still using it. It really does what it says it'll do..removes all makeup without staining the cloth itself. So, it gets used every day and I wash it once a week and it still looks new after 10 years. I paid $10 for it at Bed, Bath & Beyond (it's still the same price there)..so that's $1 a year!I do have to say that with waterproof mascara, it does take a bit more work to get it off, so using just a small drop of face wash or eye makeup remover on your eyes and then washing with this cloth, makes it much easier. Even if it's stubborn and you have to really scrub, this cloth is super soft and very gentle on your skin and eye area. My husband has rosacea, so many types of face wash just irritate him, but he can use this cloth to remove oil, dirt and grit without any reactions to it. I'm still amazed that none of the makeup sticks to the cloth..it rinses completely clean. I never travel anywhere without taking this with me. I think it's just fantastic and that everyone should have one! I just love it! Think of all the money you'd save by not having to buy face wash every few months!"
158198,2,I love these brushes and was delighted to find themon Amazon. But they must have been packed away in a ship holdsomewhere before retailing as I have had two now that had the same strong smell ofmildew in their air output when 1st using them.This has largely dissapated over time but causes me to rate a VERY useful tool with three stars.2nd review - more than a year later! - Just bought two more of these through Amazon.I can't believe the smell that was there in the first order over a year ago is present inmy brand new brushes.VERY STRONG MILDEW smell that infuses my hair/the whole room with that odor.I'm seriously thinking of returning them. Boo hoo! because it's a great tool otherwise.
40982,0,"The on/off switch is inconveniently located on the handle so that when blow drying hair, it is easy to inadvertently switch off the dryer."
71057,0,"This product was pretty. I love flat straight hair and for the first time got it. My hair is puffy and with lots of volume no matter what I do. It damaged my hair a little bit, it looked dull but I put all sorts of leave in condicioners and finishes to stop looking dry and dull. I would buy it again, I have not found any other product that will live my hair so flat and straight."
70926,0,"I did not mind the scent of this lotion and I liked the way my skin looked after application. Unfortunaltely, I started to break out after using it. It may have been the level of vitamin C for me, as I have sensitive , acne prone skin. Now that I have my acne under control (no more dairy, lactose, or casein food products for me), I will try this again."
207442,0,"Got this for 2 year old who started biting nails until bleeding & was desperate for something that we knew wasn't dangerous (read ""bordering on poisonous""). The biggest cons are that this stuff is so expensive & over packaged. They should packaged the stuff in one big tube or something to cut down cost & improve useability. The little containers (1.25"" diameter & 1"" tall) are such a pain to dip fingers into (esp. when you're the parent with fingernails--a bunch ends up getting wasted under my fingernails). The first time we tried it, he didn't seem to be bothered by the taste at all (and it is nasty bitter as I tried it on myelf first & it made me nauseous--we just have an unusual child), so we resorted to taping socks on his hands religiously at night & sometimes during the day if we saw him starting to nibble. So far this technique has been successful. For us, the healing quality of the stuff was more valuable than the prohibitive properties.One con for young children who eat with fingers is that you have to make sure you wash the stuff off really really well before mealtime because it can make everything taste bitter for them. One time my husband forgot to wash his hands really well & let him help cut some fruit for dinner. We all got a taste of the stuff; wasted some good pears too.I was a nailbiter when I was a child & was able to quit cold turkey. This probably wouldv'e worked for me, but I was actually a picky eater unlike our 2 year old who seems to like just about everything which may account for the taste not bothering him."
155177,0,"Not my fav. Very fancy, very expensive...but not great resuts. I wont buy again. It is funny to use...all that foam in your face but once you rinse...same thing before."
116587,0,"I purchased this item online to be sent to an ""Angel Tree"" type request. I did not actually receive the item, don't know if it was received, or if it is liked. I hope all the above is in the affirmative. However, the purchase process, the communication concerning the purchase and shipment was most excellent. Unless I hear future complaints that those girls are not receiving their gifts, I would not hesitate to repeat this process next gift-giving season."
12653,1,"I prefer this product over almost every other aloe vera gel. Look at the ingredient list. With most products, the first ingredient is water. The only other aloe vera gel I'll buy is Walgreen's house brand because it also lists aloe vera as the first ingredient. Aloe vera gel is very soothing on sunburn, rashes, insect bites, and after shaving. It is also a great daily moisturizer, and will not make your skin break out. I have oily skin and use this even on my face."
76899,0,"I bought this because a lot of other people reviewed it, and were obsessed with it. I definitely like the feeling of the gloss, and the application. BUTTT the gloss stinks. It smells so bad, so when it's on your lips- you can actually smell it! I thought it was just mine ...But I looked it up and others have the same review! I don't know if this is a big deal for others, but it makes a difference to me. $26 is a lot for a lipgloss that stinks!"
194755,1,"My wife loves this polish and the color although a bit dark, it looks great on her. Has a nice shimmer to it."
27592,0,The glitter in this lotion stays in chunks and does not smooth out very well... Not what I was looking for and I will not be wearing this lotion. But it does say glitter lotion so maybe I should have just picked a different product all together. The seller was very nice and It's ok...
251214,1,I love the product and would recommend it to everyone. It is great and I would purchase this item again.
7637,0,I was a little disappointed in the Axe body soap I received as it's not the same texture that I use to get when I purchased it in the stores. It seems to be watery which was a disappointment to me.
169717,0,For me it made my skin red and itchy. I have allergies so for you it might be okay.
167035,0,There is a soothing effect but I did not see any change in eliminating the redness.
6433,2,"I have bought 2 of these hair dryers because I loved it so much and thought the first one died by a fluke. It wasn't. While it's working this is a great, light-weight, lower noise hair dryer. Unfortunately, after less than a year both started flickering on and off when held at certain angles, and just got worse with continued use. This time I'm not waiting for it to get worse- I'm getting something different."
122974,2,"I have purchased this item in stores for a number of years and found it to be one of the best three-in-one products available. When the Stila convertible color stick arrived by mail the roll-up color was so soft that it broke repeatedly and the product itself created smudge instead of the usual fine line. The liner stick fell out after three days. There was no product in the shadow part, which left only the sponge in working order. I have always liked this Stila product, but will buy it in the stores from now on, where I can examine it to see if it is still the fine product I remember."
182996,2,I thought that this was a giant waste of money. It did NOTHING for me. Save your money and your time by not buying!
32494,0,"I have Curly/Kinky hair that is transitioning to natural. My hair is thin but highly dense. The true length of my hair is 20 inches total. Of those, 6"" are natural, the rest is relaxed. I don't find it difficult to detangle as is, it is just very time consuming. I was in the market for something to reduce the time I spend at it and found this here on amazon. This comb does what it says it does: It glides through the hair and it's easy to use. The problem is that it is too slow, specially in long hair and it often snags your hair without you noticing. If you use a regular comb you can feel the snags as you move along and be more careful, but with this you really can't unless it's a big knot. If only it could cover a larger amount of hair then this would be a higher rated product from my end, but since it can only cover a small amount at a time with since it's small comb, it's a waste of time.Pro:Fast delivery.Great value.Works as described.Lasting Battery.Comes with a dock to make it stand uprightCute designCordlessCon:Very slow.The comb is SO SMALL, covers very little hair at a time.It is also very loud. Though it is just a comb, it is very indiscreet. You do not want to be in a bathroom in a shared house for a long time with something so loud.Overall: Not for little girls or women with massive amounts of hair like me. I have had better results with a big shower comb in a shorter amount of time.Though it works for some, this product was clearly not designed for big curly hair. With that in mind, it would be unreasonable to hold this too hard against Remington, since it is not aimed for this consumer market. However, this review might be helpful for someone with similar hair texture who is also transitioning and looking to purchase this. I will revisit this product again when my hair is fully natural so I can offer a more comprehensive review, but for now it's just ""meh""."
28926,1,It was a great opportunity to purchase my Amazing Grace from this vendor. Love love love the price and the product came earlier than expected! Will buy again and again! Thanks!
228733,1,"One of those classic, sophisticated perfumes I have in my collection of perfumes. Lasts longer than most cologne did."
34412,2,"I got this perfume in hopes it would smell good.I was dissappointed it stinks ,smells old or something,would not recommend this product for anyone who wants to smell good."
133850,1,This is a really good quality kit. The person I bought it for was very pleased. Very roomy and as advertised.
13828,1,Egyptian Goddess is one of my favorite fragrances. It has a beautiful soft scent that is great for layering. Using the soap together with the oil/perfume is not overpowering. Soap feels and smells like a luxury. Definitely a favorite!
109712,0,"Ok this scent smells ok but come on It's old as dirt. I think its great price wise for children that are starting to wear cologne ages 15-16, but if your a man and you hit on a girl that hasn't been living under a rock the last 15 years she is going to laugh at you and think you are a cheap jerk.Let's break it down ,your 27 yrs old wearing a $30 cologne that Ronald Regan probably wore and try to get a girl thirsty that's wearing a BeBe outfit with $400 heels on ,OMG she will run. The good news is they have hi end stuff that kids and old men in diapers arnt wearing. If you tell that same rooster your wearing $135 Tom Ford or $90 Gucci Guilty you will be getting in that ,trust me. Even you young guys ,you know who's wearing this stuff still? Druggies who steal a bottle from CVS ,then they get all decked out for their NA meeting and bath in this and think their cooler then the bottom side of a pillow. So if you want that smell or wait....Let's say you like cougars , you might get a couple off the strength of Drakkar, I can't lie about that. If you want a 70 year old cougar that probably voted for JFK and fantasized about Regan then this is your stuff,this is all you. Hang out with some druggie that likes 70yr olds DN is you!Bottom line: It has a musk like scent that wears off after a few hours and a great price for the younger crowd,I don't recommend for the established man though and I'm sure its faked a lot too that's another thing you gotta be careful of, especially if your younger and a first time buyer you may think your so cool wearing a well rated cologne from the good folks at Amazon ,meanwhile your spraying a knockoff and have no clue. I would feel terrible if a younger man was hanging with his friends and they bullied him for having a knockoff on especially of a $30 cologne like come on get your stuff together,they'd probably all get a headache then the wearer would be in a depressed state for awhile I don't even wanna think about a guy having that happen with a girl soBottom Line: be careful where you purchase from ,don't get it from China,and I think you'll be ok ,hope this helped"
9996,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."
159230,1,I've been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks now and I love it! It really evens out the texture and tone of my skin. I recommend trying it!
176386,1,This is probably in the top 3 perfumes for me that my wife wears consistently. Somebody in another review mentioned that the scent seems to disappear earlier than in the past. I've sort of thought the same thing but at the same time I'm sure there is something to be said for your nose just getting used to certain scents. I'm a fan of finding a few perfumes/colognes you like and then just mixing up what you wear that day and matching it to your mood and activity for the day. This seems to help some in the notice factor for what you smell?????
189004,2,"I read so many great reviews about this product, so I decided to try it. All I can say it's that this product is not for everyone. Instead of making my eczema better, let's just say that it ""angered"" my skin and didn't stop the itchiness. I had to make more research to help my condition, and what worked for me was Eucerin's Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme."
199244,0,"I gave this product a three star rating. (at this time)I have not used the product long enough to see significant results. After being sick in 2007 and losing some of my hair as a result of the illness, I was told about these vitamins by a professional at a salon. He informed me that one of his clients had used these vitamins - after her illness - and she was very pleased with regrowth of her hair as well as new hair growth. I will buy them again as I want to give the product at least six months to see if there are adequate results."
36146,0,"I purchased this shampoo because I LOVED the white camellia shampoo.I have coarse and dry hair( Im african american). so after very thorough reviewing of this product I decided that there were more positive reviews than negative reviews. So today I finally used this shampoo and ladies let me tell you this stuff completely strips your hair!! Not an a altogether bad way but in a very squeaky clean but my hair will be tangled type way.I did a hot oil treatment with coconut oil first and then commenced with the shampooing. This does lather sort of but once I finished the first wash I felt that I should wash it for a second time. My hair was clean, my scalp didnt feel as itchy as before I started but my hair felt like it had been washed with detergent. BUT the saving grace for this product is when used with its conditioner (or another very moisturizing one of your choosing) your hair does come out very smooth, a whole lot less coarse, and shiny. Its alot easier to comb and detangle.This is one of those products that must be used with the matching ( and fabulous) conditioner as it suggests or another moisturizing one of your choice."
133413,2,I love this brand but wasn't overly impressed with this cleanser. Dried out my skin and didn't clear it up.
172359,2,"I put this in my hair, to make it shine as the product name says, but all it did was make my hair look and feel very greasy. My hair was heavy the whole day. I was not happy. Also, the product is advertised as unisex, but it has a very male scent. It doesn't smell good at all. All in all, I wish I hadn't bought it. You should save you money."
9458,2,"First, I love Dr. Ohhira's probiotics and have taken them for years. I expect more from this company that to use horse fat in a product. This is disgusting and unethical. It also makes me reconsider taking the probiotic from this company.I will not support a company that exploits horses. How pathetic that it is being touted as "" not tested on animals"" when animals are in the product. Shame on Essential Formulas!!"
203648,2,"So I saw the infomercial and I was sold!I usually am with any infomercials.I have been using it and it doesnt smell that great, but not bad. Not that its advertised as smelling great.But it is advertised as protecting your hair color and for me it hasnt made a significant difference.Would I buy it again? Not personally. Would I recommended? No.Sorry!"
56993,2,I like using a plain white men's t-shirt much better. $13 for a 7 pack of t shirts instead of $10 for this horrible towel.
108017,0,"This perfume smells citrusy, more on the orange side, and a little sweet.However, this perfume is too simple for me. For example, J'adore is a sophisticated perfume with a hint of citrus, but this perfume is just orangy and sweet, which I liked when I was a mid-teenager (14-18) but not now.If you like a simple perfume that smells citrusy/orangy and a little sweet, then this is a good choice. If you'd rather have a sophisticated than a fun perfume, then I'd suggest J'adore, it is fresh, sophisticated, lady-like and with a hint of citrus."
92212,1,Bought the waterproof pencil for vacation. Love how it goes on and also the fact that it stays on. I went with the blond and would recommend a lighter color even for darker hair.
84695,0,So they sell this product in either 1.7 or 3.4. I am curious as to why this one is 3.3? They dont sell it like that anywhere else...so guess a lil confused???
32287,0,"The color is good but it is not as I imaged. I love it anyway.The issue is it is not as thick as the OPI product I have purchased before. It is hard to use. I don't know why. I viewed some review of other OPI product from the same seller. Two reviews say it is not real OPI products. I am not sure about that but it makes me feel bad.If anyone has used it before, pls let me know what you feel. Thanks so much."
63306,1,"...but this stuff WORKS. Holy cow! I've been using it, plus the Daily Regenerating Serum, every morning, then the Eye Serum again plus the Micro Sculpting Serum at night. I started the regimen about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin. I'm 47 & have the usual signs of aging (though I am lucky, not severe): crow's feet, vertical lines between my eyebrows, some vertical lines around my mouth, plus slight sagging at the jowls. Nothing ""scary"" but noticeable enough to make me want to address them. I had been using ROC eye & face retinol treatments but they didn't do what these products have been doing, and in a much shorter time. I am truly impressed. The crow's feet are definitely softened, the lip lines are looking better, AND the jowl area is tighter and less ""mushy"". I have signed up for Subscribe & Save on all of these products, PLUS the Night Resurfacing Elixir and the Micro Sculpting Cream, more for my neck than my face, since I tend to break out with anything heavier than a lotion. I'm sold. :)NOTE: One caveat about the Eye Serum- I noticed that it didn't moisturize as much as I like, so a few minutes after applying the serum, I do put on a thin layer of L'Oreal Age Perfect eye cream (in the little white jar), and the two products combined seem to do the trick for me."
73843,0,"I went through a bottle in two weeks. It takes A LOT of shampoo to distribute throughout your hair. I have long hair and have never had to use such a high volume of shampoo at one time. It took over a tablespoon of shampoo everytime I washed, whereas with other shampoos I used a teaspoon. It smells great and seems of high quality. I love the conditioner that accompanies it."
104302,0,"I'd rather have the Citrus Mint version, but I have never seen it listed anywhere for sale...is there such a fragrance? This is just OK, and rather ""common"" smelling."
179166,0,"I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
198090,2,"At first, I loved this item and thought it was the best purchase I had made for my hair. I have had the straightener for about 6 months. As of a few weeks ago, I was straightening my hair when all of a sudden a spark came from the straightening iron, nearly burning my face and could have possibly set my hair on fire. After getting in touch with Farouk (the company that owns Chi)to get a new one or get my money back, they informed me that since I did not purchase the iron at a professional salon, they could not grant me a new one or a refund, for it states this in the warrenty. I am now battling with the store that I purchased it from and it is starting to look like I am out of [the purchase price]."
72490,1,"I have a flat top hair cut and I use this product in place of butch wax. It holds almost as well, but instead of being sticking and stiff, it is soft with no stickyness and good holding power. I have very soft and fine hair, if it holds my hair in place it will hold anything - good product."
163333,0,I am not an expert on skin brushing but I do not think that the brush is suppose to feel like you are scraping your skin off. This brush is VERY hard. It has thick stick like stems incorporated into the bristles. I was trying to brush as gently as I could and I was still having scrape marks on my skin. I sat with scissors and tried to cut all of the sharp stick things out of the bristles (I had a lot of time on my hands) and it still feels like a brush you would use to brush a horse. I read that a dry skin brush is suppose to be not to firm and not to soft and in my opinion this one is to hard.
214010,1,"Purchased directly from Amazon for $9.32. Arrived in a sealed bag, which is nice if you've ordered other stuff in the same shipment. Fresh product. I ordered in April 2012 and the expiration is stamped as January 2014. I removed the foil seal and it smelled fresh, with zero odor.The lack of scent is actually something I prefer, since I use this primarily as a facial moisturizer (a few drops go a long way). I have ultra-sensitive skin and this oil is amazing. Absorbs in a few minutes and I wear it all day with no irritation.I've been using the Now Foods Sweet Almond Oil for three months now, and even with an oily t-zone, have had no breakouts or issues that usually occur with other moisturizers. My skin actually looks more even-toned and has a healthy glow, without looking greasy (after the oil absorbs, of course).I like that this product is of high quality and that it's food grade, 100% sweet almond oil (no vitamin additives).My mom recommended this to me, and I happily recommend it to anyone wanting to try it. Hope this review helps."
99323,0,"Love this hand sanitizer, especially in the green apple scent. The blue raspberry scent is also nice. Would love to order it from Amazon but it's less than 1/3 of the price (99 cents!) at Target. It's in the section with all the travel toiletries."

239682,1,I was very pleased with my product. Thank You! It was the exact color I was looking for. Love it!
224998,0,"i liked it...it's really great for on the bus, im in highschool, when your going to basketball games that are 2 or so hours away and you want to sleep. when you wake up you can fix your hair, and it works well...some firm hold hair spray makes it work VERY good. one con of it is that it takes 12 hours to charge...and only works 45 mins. But, what can you expect for under 30 bucks?"
100322,0,I received my order on time. The company sent the order as I ordered it. I can't say if the product works or not because it has a scent to it that I can't take. I have only used the product one time so I guess I haven't used it enough to make a fair review but the business that sold it I would do business with again.
30330,0,"The fragrance is inviting. However, the scentbecomes faint within three to four hours. Not worth the price..."
235734,0,"I bought the smaller bottle of this leave in conditioner. Definitely not worth the hype and price. It left my hair more staticky than on the days that I don't use it. Everyone also raved about the smell, but I thought it smells like dish soap. It doesn't make my hair feel softer, shinier, fuller, etc..I'll probably continue to use it because I bought it and it's not like it ruins my hair, but I'd never buy it again. I have blonde fine hair."

I stopped using the oil immediately, but by the next day I had more red, blistery bumps on both my arms. They itched like crazy! It has been 4 days and I still have this intensly itchy rash and am trying to control it with hydrocortisone cream and benadryl. I would not recommend jojoba oil to anyone with sensitive skin."
165996,0,I bought this product at my local walmart and tried it right away. It felt soo good and was very easy to use. The smell was good too. I was however disappointed the next day when I had a huge pimple on my forehead. Its to early to say if its cus of this product or not but I'm going to keep using it an find out.
167140,1,"It was easy to apply and stayed on well. My only complaint is the smell. It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion. Now that I think about it, extra must be applied to the reddest areas. If too mush is applied to white areas, the skin turns green. it took practice, but eventually it helped. I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin."
123095,2,", sodium benzoate, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, fragrance (parfum). Fake fragrance and sodium benzoate. Never understand why they sell this at whole foods and how it continues to pass as ""natural"". I guess petroleum is natural, too. Too bad they don't list the multiple chemicals that are in the ""parfum""."
195691,0,HUGE and I have a big head. Like the color and it does absorb sweat well. Had to take it in so it would stay on my head during yoga!

28088,1,"For me, the color of this lipstick is perfect: just a hint of plum that brightens a deep brownish-red or reddish brown. But what is most amazing about the Prestige lipsticks is that they are long-lasting, but not at all drying, and wear off gracefully. I can go all day without retouching and still have a bit of EVEN color on my lips. I have not found another lipstick at any price that performs as well."
236728,2,"This was recommended to me by a Dermatologist, so naturally I came on Amazon to see the reviews first. Although it seemed like the product had mixed reviews, I went ahead and tried it for myself. I am a 28 year old female and naturally have dark circles under my eyes that I was tired of covering up with concealer. After about a week of using this product, I seemed to have more noticeable lines (wrinkles!) under my eyes than before I started using it. After two weeks, I developed what appeared to be three small growths (protruding bumps) underneath my right eye. I contacted my dermatologist who told me to immediately stop using the product. After a few days off of the product, the bumps went away. I may have had a bad batch of the product, or some weird allergic reaction, but for both reasons I would not recommend to this product to anyone--at least anyone my age that would like to avoid a product that seemed to cause premature wrinkles."

Hope you cant tried and see what I am taking about. God Bless bye"

101905,0,"My wife and I both get the occasional break out in what we refer to as ""stress spots"". Places we tend to rest a hand or what-not during times of stress. She has very dry pale skin tone and I have an oily yet olive skin tone.Our results were exactly the opposite. She seemed to get no benefit whatsoever from the product aside from what seemed like dryer skin. I had slightly drier skin (though that is admittedly very hard to quantify) yet my acne cleared right up in just a couple of days. The process was so simple that the instructions were useless after the first night.Would I recommend it to a friend? With our results I would have to say probably not unless they had a means of testing the product first. This system is a good chunk of money to end up with dry skin. Yet if you are in my shoes, the results were rather fantastic. Maybe that is the nature of these products though. Searching until you find one that works."
105628,0,I grabbed this because my normal product wasn't in stock. I use it on my legs and bikini area. It is reasonably effective but I have used better.
19741,0,Works pretty good. I have fine hair so I have to make sure I don't put on too much.
157732,0,"I've used this a few times before doing a review. I'm still on the fence on whether or not I'll keep using it. Here are my thoughts.PROS:1) heats up fast2) gets really hot3) does curl your lashes (I have asian lashes, so it took a few swipes)CONS:1) uses up batteries. It took awhile for my lashes to curl the way I like them. I think that if your eyelashes are already curly, you would save a little bit of batter power. But it won't be by much. For me, it's almost one battery per one and half usage.So in all, it's not a bad little tool, if I had the time to use it. I think I'm just so used to my manual eyelash curler (Shu Emura) that I find that using this is a little tedious."
117526,0,"I have found that it leaves waaaay too much soap scum even after just 3 showers. I hate cleaning the tub so often. You HAVE to clean it before a bath. It's a real pain. I have gone back to using Dove. I've used milk soap before, but a different kind, and loved it. Maybe this brand is fine if you don't take baths."
119756,0,Steam is not hot enough. Price is reasonable. I've been using it for over 2 years and still working. Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.
236794,0,This towel is way smaller than I thought it was going to be. It does do a good job of soaking up excess water from my hair but it needs to be bigger. I like my microfiber turban better.
169676,0,I had my hopes up high when I ordered this product. I live in Michigan where the winters are very dry and the summers are extremely humid. I have thick wavy hair and after using this product my hair didn't feel much different than other products I've used. I still had frizzy hair. I'll keep using it until it's gone but I'm dissapointed it didn't work for me.
235433,2,"I tried this product consistently for 8 months. It did not work at all. I wish I could get my money back but the guarantee had expired. I really put to much faith in this product but I should have realized that the insufficent amount of reviews should of warned me. The company has been around for many years, there should be more results and reviews. I am now using a product that is FDA cleared Laser that has studies out and good results etc. Good luck!"
50682,2,"I had a different Caruso Hairsetter for 12 years and it broke. The new one doesn't make the curlers as moist, so it doesn't curl the hair as well. I am very dissappointed in this product and wish I could send it back."
236600,1,actually this was a gift from my sister i didn't follow the instructions. i actually apply it when ever i feel like it including before bed time. i am using this product for over a week and i am noticing a very big difference in my lashes length. the only problem is that my right eye respond more clearly than the other one but i think this is only me not the product.

116556,0,"The Revlon RV059C Perfect Heat Professional Hair Straightener is loved by thousands born with curly hair that thinks the other side has greener grass. This hair straightening tool works so good! It has turned my untameable hair into beautiful hair. I completely depend on this one tool to keep my hair looking good because it is too short to wear curly because it fluffs too much. Sounds like the perfect tool huh? Well it is... if you don't mind having to buy six of them. I am on my sixth purchase of the Revlon RV059C Perfect Heat Professional Straightener! Each one I bought have ended up breaking before I even had it for a month! Suddenly, in the middle of getting ready to go out, it will just stop working completely. Sometime's a plate just stops working, leaving you with another half an hour of straightening your hair. I have been using the Revlon Straightener since Christmas, and I have just gone through my sixth one because they break so easily. I know it has nothing to do with my house because it has broken at two of my friends houses before and now at my dad's house. I just bought this straightener to replace the one that the plate just stopped working, and it hasn't even been two weeks, and it has already broke. I was in the middle of straightening my hair and it just cut off and won't turn back on. Now I don't know what kind of straightener I should buy that will work as good as this one. I am very hesitant on buying my seventh straightener from the same company. By the way, my friend is going on her fourth one. So you decide.. perfect.. or not?"

194284,2,It does not appear to do anything for me. I started to break out after using it and after about a week I just couldn't keep using it as my face was getting worse and worse. It doesn't really lather up at all but it is a large bottle so there is a lot of product.
182247,0,"I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
77041,1,I have used this for about 10 years. It is the only conditioner that has ever worked on my dry hair. I would buy a lifetime supply if I thought it wouldn't go bad. I am always afraid they will stop making this.
238699,0,it looks totally legit but there is something funny about the smell. it still smells good but doesnt seem to be a strong as the bottles at the mall. maybe thats why it was so cheap. maybe a stale batch or something.
3381,2,"I bought this product because I'd been researching it for a while. It is silky on your skin, but for me, I thought this product made me break out! I don't usually get lots of breakouts on my skin, but for some reason after using this I noticed more and more especially on my cheeks and forehead.I'm not sure why it didn't work for me, and I was disappointed because I do have oily skin!Maybe it was in combination with other stuff, but I didn't like it. And I didn't notice a difference at all in the amount of oil on my face."
66187,0,"I used to have a brush with a combination of nylon quills and bristle and it did a great job. But eventually it broke and I couldn't find one to replace it until now. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about this brush. The size is good, the bristles are good, my problem is with the nylon quills. They are longer than the bristles (as they should be) but are just strands of nylon that have been cut straight across the end, which means that they are surprisingly scratchy! Couldn't they have rounded the ends? For the price, I think so. It does an ok job getting through my long hair, but my nylon Conair does it better. So now I brush with the Conair to remove the tangles, and follow up with the Denman to smooth the hair. On the plus side, it's pretty easy to clean - the air hole is on the tip of the brush, so is easy to cover when washing."

214998,0,"When I first began to use Pureology products about a year ago, I was impressed with their efficacy. However, as I am now approaching our anniversary, I am somewhat less impressed. I have discovered that WHERE I buy the product is important. Amazon is first-rate, but buying via a supermarket is not as reliable. These products are dreadfully expensive, and if you are on a very tight budget (aren't we all?), then you should think carefully about purchasing them."

237333,0,"Disappointed with the film that Castile leaves on my stainless sink. Other than that, the product is as described. Scent is mild. While the label on the bottle is chalked full of interesting graffiti, nowhere does it give any dilution ratios. I found that very annoying. I had to look them up online."
151453,0,I always used Pantene's Silver Expressions for my hair. Pantene did an excellent job of eliminating any yellowing of my hair. They no longer manufacture that product to my chagrin. I have only used Jhirmack a few times. I think it's working but it doesn't give my hair the same feeling. The hair is not yellowing but does not have the silver sheen that Pantene gave it. It also took much longer to receive than the promised date.
191210,0,"I was buying this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she has thick, curly hair that really requires the ceramic-ionic technology. She also wanted one with a cord keeper and I was excited to find this model that seemed to have everything she was looking for at a reasonable price, but when it arrived and I looked at the box, there wasn't anything about the diffuser that is listed in the product description. All that is included is a concentrator, which is exactly the opposite of what my sister needs. So this is going back and I'm back at square one with a very limited amount of time. At least Amazon has a good return policy!"
217627,1,"I have using this product for a few years and have found it easy to use, and it will last through several shampoos. Properly applied it leaves your hair looking natural without an artificial look. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully, because if you leave it on too long the more likely one is to develop some minor scalp irritation. Perform the skin patch test the manufacture recommends to help judge your sensitivity to the dye. You will need to experiment with the timing because if you shampoo off the dye too soon you will be left with grey hair. Also use something like Vaseline along the edges of your hairline as it will dye normal hairless skin. For some of you where there is more scalp than hair, you may to buy Vaseline in barrels... try to keep it on just yourself as it well stain counter tops etc. The key is to remove any excess quickly. The manufacture's directions are good, and mention all of this. This is an excellent product at an very reasonable price. Give it a try!"
177430,1,I got a smaller bottle of this for Christmas 2009. She liked it so much she asked for it again. I hadn't seen the price for this anywhere near what I got it from here for. She still likes it and I think it smells good on her.
170869,0,"This is a very lovely color, I just wish it weren't so watery and didn't require 3 layers to reach optimal pigmentation."
248504,1,I love this product and it will last you a very long time. You only need a little since you are just using it for your face. I added some drops of lemon oil to the mixture and put it on my face while I slept and when I woke up my skin looked amazing! It was so smooth and you couldn't even see my pores! It reduced my pores so much! I will definitely buy this product again! I highly recommend it if you have enlarged pores or if you have scarring. It works very well.

70588,0,The product arrived in record time and is as described. I would have liked a sample before I bought because the color is not right for my skin.
3271,0,I loved the smell of the product but it got the bathtub messy after you're done. And who wants to spend time cleaning the bathtub after having a relaxing soak.
20760,2,"This prduct is OK, but just OK. Think about it: Why do they include SPF 16 in a product named and designed for nighttime use, most likely used before bed? I was curious, so I called Neutrogena to ask them. They had no answer. The young lady who answered the phone said it was because {even at night, indoors, in bed and asleep),""We are always exposed to the sun."" When I asked her to explain her statement, she paused and read through her sheet of standard replies, and said, ""We are very sorry for your inconvenience."" Guess they had not provided her with an answer to such a basic question.This market is so competitive that all manufactures go to extremes. The names of the products get longer and longer, they contain more and more stuff, regardless of it being appropriate, such as sunscreen at night, and the truth is they are all the same, some just more expensive that others.The only thing sure for improvimng your skin is retinol. The more retinol a product contains, the more likely it is to improve your skin. Compare retinol content and go with the best price, and forget about brand names and hype. The wise thing to do is increase retinol cntent gradually (buy smallest amount of product available) and gradually to avoid irritation to the skin, and work you way up to stronger and stronger amounts and your skin required for improvement.Use your head, because the manufacturers (Neutrogena, Olay, etc.,) do not."
228805,2,"This didn't do a thing for me. It was a bit sticky, but didn't add definition or separate curls or any of that nonsense. I have generally healthy, medium length, fine hair (and a lot of it). I use the cleansing conditioner and stick with my Matrix gel and mousse for styling."

76657,0,"I recently bought this conditioner, and I'm sad to say I'm disappointed. I had used it before with good results, so I had high expectations. It didn't meet them. It didn't make my hair very shiny. It did make my hair soft and manageable, but I was hoping for lots of shine. Also, there's the smell. It's not a bad smell. It's not unpleasant. It's actually kind of nice. I just don't want my hair to smell like that. The smell clashes with other scented products I use, and I don't want that. I would much prefer a nice floral smell, or unscented."
106928,0,"After reading the good reviews of the Tantowels, I was excited to use it. I used one towellette - then another 3 hours later.First the smell - when you're applying the towelette the smell is very pleasant - basically like a normal wet-wipe. But hours later that typical artificial tan &quot;chemical smell&quot; appeared, and stayed there.The color is very natural looking. I really like the color.My biggest problem - streaks. I really tried to apply evenly, which I thought would be easy with the towelette. But now I have a white streak down the side of one arm, and some patchy white spots on the other arm. Also whichever part you start with, will be darker since you get less tan as the towel dries.After this fades I will try again . . . but I won't be buying another pack of Tantowels."

After using this mirror with the magnification, I noticed that my eyebrows were definitely nicer because I could see all the strays!

Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
38405,1,"My husband visited Germany and brought this back for me. I used it all up and really missed the fresh smell and calming effect. The smell is not too fruity or perfumey, but very clean smelling. I was super excited to find this product on Amazon. The bottle is really big and all you need is a small amount in a bath tub, so it really lasts. If you are a bubble bath junkie, like myself, you have to invest in this bubble bath. There's nothing quite like it!"

To us, this smells like baby powder, which we both hate. Maybe other reviewers are right and this isn't the real thing, I don't know, but this also was not &#34;delicate&#34;. My wife felt nauseous after wearing it for a little while. Once she showered it off, she felt fine."

87327,0,Bought this shampoo because my hair was suffering from sun and too much time in the pool. I'm not sure that this was the right choice - bought because it was natural but think that it was meant more as a scalp therapy. Not sure I like the scent but that's a very personal thing.

For example, I usually carry a comb in my back pocket and on a recent train trip, I didn't put the comb in my pocket correctly and it broke when I sat down. It's also kind of expensive. However, my pet Sasquatch says, ""This comb pulled all the bugs and leaves out of my hair. I'll use it every time before I go out on the town."" I guess it worked for him, but he doesn't comb his hair very often so I don't think he's the best one to take a recommendation from."

95527,1,"I discovered a while ago that curling irons are the only thing that can create natural-looking, long-lasting waves or curls for my hair (I'm Asian and so have thick, naturally-straight hair). This was my very first curling iron, I got it just two days ago (from Walmart, actually, not Amazon, but it's exactly the same thing that you see here) and I am very pleased with it. It works very well and my hair looks beautiful.The only issue is that I always have to flip the little counter stand up and down.....I flip it up to rest it on the counter while getting the next section of hair, but I have to swing it back down to take full advantage of the barrel. I'm also a little nervous about the cord, because the cord-plug area is a little skinny/flimsy, but I hope it holds up for a while. Otherwise, great product!"
207548,1,this was a great set of nail colors all in good condition.gave as gift and they were very pleased with it
196968,2,"I purchased this flat iron from Amazon EXACTLY 60 days ago and this morning, when I plugged it in the red light turned on.....when I came back to straighten my hair a little while later, the light was off and the iron was cool. After going to work with frizzy hair I returned home to try it again...no luck. I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this site. The iron is not covered by the warranty because it was purchased from Amazon, not an authorized hair salon! I took my chances when ordering the iron because the price was right....Buyer BEWARE, spend a few more dollars and buy it from a hair salon. Ulta Beauty has the iron for a similar price when it's on sale! Like some other reviewers I think this is a cheaper version of the ones that sell in salons. My daughter has the Paul Brown flat iron and it's been great for over a year!"
92599,1,"This clear top coat is the best one I have ever found. I have been using it for the past 5 years, and I have been using nail polish since 1978. It covers great, dries super-fast, and looks good. I am always looking for a good price on it on-line. It is hard to find in stores - Ulta is often out - but I don't go to beauty specialty shops so maybe it is easy to find at those. Anyway this was a good price.It arrived in a mailing envelop and I thought it might be smashed, but it wasn't. I will buy another because my daughter may steal this one, lol."
227684,0,"Overall, Coriandre is an easy-to-wear chypre (really?) that is as season-less & classic as a lightweight gabardine suit. The opening is crisp, clean & clear. The coriander note is subtle to me, not spicy, and I have no problems with wear. As it goes into the heart, I am picking up a bit a soapiness & barely-there soft florals. Dries down to a dry moss & vetiver scent, yet it's quite feminine to me.Coriandre is a soapy woody on me that's not very long-lasting. I've heard so much about the rose in Coriandre, but it's nothing to write home about in the formulation that I'm testing. In fact, I purposely picked up the 33ml frosted cylindrical bottle based reports that it was close to the original rose chypre formulation. Sadly, it's not.This Coriandre might be a good choice if you're tired of big floral scents and overtly sweet ones. However, I wasn't looking for a soapy woody floral, and there are no redeeming qualities in this fragrance that would encourage me to give it shelf space."
240375,0,"The ""light"" feature is virtually useless. The amount of illumination is negligible so you need to be in a very well-lit room already to take full advantage of this mirror.The amount of magnification is also not as great as some other mirrors. Coupled with the smaller than average size and you need to get up real close...A plus is the fact that, if you do want the light, it runs on batteries so you don't have to have a cord and plug running across your sink/ vanity/ make-up table.Final negative is the ""Revlon"" on the base. I hoped it was a removable sticker for packaging only, but alas, Revlon wants to make you part of their advertising."

98397,1,"Terre D'Hermes takes me back to Corsicana, Texas - a local drugstore where I got ice cream after visiting the eye doctor. Three times a week my mother drove me to the eye doctor for eye therapy to help correct my ""lazy eye.""Whirling discs, eye patches, 3-D glasses flipped every hour, drops, flashlights in the dark - all worked to give me control of my eyes. Well, the surgery at age seven didn't hurt either. Wait! Yes it did!But, now I am able to keep my eyes straight.Three times a week the 60 mile trek in our old Buick let me come closer to controlling my eye positions. And, after each visit, my mother would take me into the drugstore for ice cream. But the scent wasn't ice cream.Terre D'Hermes has an incredible earthy scent. It has tones of earth, fern, musk (the good kind), bark, green - and some magical reminder scent of that drug store.People always compliment me when I wear it. Close friends say, ""You're wearing that amazing scent again.""Yes, I am."
182244,0,"As a turquoise fanatic and nail polish enthusiast, I had to purchase this.Pros:-Only two coats needed-Bright color-Dries insanely fastCons:-Appears to be flat, no shimmer /gloss to it and thus a top coat of clear is needed. Some girls choose to skip this step but you can't really do that with this one.-The turquoise ended up being a teel that leans very green. This wasn't what I was looking for at all.-Thin polish that chips easily, another reason to need a top coat of clear."
217541,2,"I've owned two of these curling irons and both times I've had issues with the on/off buttons. The first iron I had, the off button quit working; meaning I'd have to unplug the thing to turn it off. The iron finally just quit working. When I got my second iron (thinking this couldn't possibly happen again), within 2 weeks, and mind you, I only use the curling iron 2-3 times a week, the off button felt loose and I had to wiggle it to turn it off. Within 2 months, the on button fell into the curling iron.... never to be seen or heard from again. I'm done with this product!"

43048,2,"Half-strength at best. Some is cheating. I've been using this product for years and the last one I bought ""stinks!"" (pun intended.)

152012,0,"I have long hair (waist length, but thin). I prefer to air dry my hair, but that is just too uncomfortable in the winter, so I decided to try the turban.I love the microfiber. I believe it really does help my hair dry more quickly. Note, I said more quickly. Not necessarily quickly. I love that the turban holds my hair off of my neck and back. Ideally, it always does that. Realistically, while my hair all fits in the turban, wrapping it so I can button it, and it stays in place, is a pain! Really difficult for me to do (but maybe it's easier for more coordinated gals).I'd give the microfiber itself four stars, but because the turban is a hassle, I'm only giving this product three stars. If I needed another such product I'd just buy a microfiber towel."
173777,2,"I was tremendously dissapointed with this product. First off, it took forever to get to me, actually arriving well after the date it said it was going to. They also used waaaaay more packaging than was remotely necessary - a huge 9""x10"" envelope for this tiny little jar. And lastly the jar was really really really small, if I put makeup in there I have no idea how I would get it out again without making a huge mess since the top is too small for anything larger than an eyeshadow brush and it only has three holes in the top anyway. Booo."
243111,2,"I wanted a powder eye liner. I guess I should've known it was going to be messy. But I don't really use it because it gets all over my counter, but even worse all over my face.

I am went back to using my liquid liner."
7738,0,"I bought this cologne merely after reading a few reviews on amazon... may be i should have tried it on personally before i bought it. The cologne actually smell nice. Its got a nice fresh smell to it. The only thing is since it was made in the 80's all the older people have used it and kind of smells old. If you are in your 20's i wouldn't recommend this, may be if in you late 30's.The smell remains for 4-6 hrs depends on various factor, fades away nice smelling too."

142887,1,"I saw a similar product at the mall, but thought 59.00 was too much, esp since i did not need all the lotions they were selling, so I came home and went online. I found this product first try ! IT WORKS just as well as the costly one , EASY TO USE, less than 5 minutes and my nails are beautiful and glossy."
56275,2,You know Like may others I got this because of everyone saying how much they loved it. And I was looking for a more grown up smell. Sadly I HATED IT! it smells to peppery when you first spray it for one. And its really reminds me of old women or a bingo hall. Even when it dries down I still think it smells gross. I own the new SJP NYC perfume and love that one. I think this one was made popular because of Orpah (shame on you..lol) Now Im stuck with a smell I wont be able to wear til im 70.

This was my second order, I ordered 1 the first time and it was OK. Thought I would give it another try and I was wrong. Wal-Mart now carries it as does Macy's. Go there for your purchase.

I used it at night only, since it doesn't include SPF. It seemed to be hydrating without being oily. I kept using it for a week at night, even after finding my luggage. I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek. Back to Jojoba and La Posay Roche.This just reinforces why I never buy drugstore products."

So incredible its cult like in its following. I know Auric Blends isn't stupid and they haven't changed the fragrance... but the last bottle of roll on I got from PENNY LANE GIFTS here on Amazon was BAD. It smelled like unscented oil w/ a little TINY hint of Egyptian Goddess. Amazon, hold PENNY LANE accountable for selling us defective stuff! I want my money back... or at least the same roll on stuff I got last summer from Tom's Incense. I'm ordering it directly from Auric Blends website so I can actually smell like the real stuff."

I might note that I only walked from my house to my car, drove for a few minutes and walked into another building. I was not physically working other than walking.This patch may be OK in Alaska, but it is of NO USE in Texas!"
196624,1,really like my styling iron works really good. Did have one and someone told me it would help with the frizz and it really has. Taking a while to learn how to use it but it is working out great
29726,1,This product is fabulous but it is not designed for everyone. It's an over-the-counter item but be careful in using it as it can be very drying if your skin is not oily. Do your research or talk to a dermatologist before using this product.
248807,2,If I could I would give no stars at all for this item. Don't buy it unless you wanna smell like a dog

No cellophane wrapping on box and bottle seems to have been tampered with. I have never had this problem with an Amazon merchant before. I am very disappointed in merchant and Amazon. Maybe Amazon doesn't need my business anymore. I sure they probably don't care. How unfortunate."
5269,0,"After having ordered medium beige, I thought I would go up one shade (golden medium) due to that being too light for me. When it arrived, I wasn't sure if it was suitable or not, so I opened it. Again I found this colour to be too light, to make a difference on my skin. I knew I couldn't return it then, so luckily i had an old tin of bare minerals in a very dark shade. It took time, but I managed to mix it all together to get a much more suitable shade. Time will tell! My friend did advise me that it is better to go 2 shades up in bare minerals, if it is the main makeup you use for evening wear.I experienced no problems with delivery time and service."

127339,1,"I love Tone, love the smell and how it makes my skin soft, and the wonderful scent lingers longer than with other soaps. I switch between Irish Spring, Tone, and body wash. I love the smell of Tone, but I think that is the cocoa butter in it that other people don't like. I have cocoa butter lotion, and that has an even stronger scent, but I like that smell, too."
172940,0,The reason i say its okay is because i wish it was an actual lotion type to blend in because it doesnt blend in like lotion but it works on a pimple tho... Id rather return to using murad. I give it three stars because i wish it was more lotion type.

212057,1,"My parents used to sell vitamins and my dad has been taking Vitamin E for what seems like my entire lifetime. When I accidentally spilled a bowl of hot jello on my stomach as a child, I was worried I would have a lovely scar for life. Fortunately our local drug store in Africa sold a Vitamin E soaked gauze pad that you could keep over the burn and it completely healed and there is no scar.So, I've looked for Vitamin E gauze in America and have not found any. So, I buy the Johnson and Johnson First Aid Gauze pads and if I burn myself on the rare occasion while cooking, I soak the pad with the Jason Vitamin E oil and have noticed great results in a short period of time. The Nexcare Gentle Paper First Aid tape also works well to hold the gauze in place. If you are allergic to band-aids, this is a lifesaver!The JASON 32,000 I.U. Vitamin E Pure Beauty Oil has been a favorite for years because it has a little wand attached to the lid which makes application very easy, although you may not want to use the wand directly on the burn, just it allows the oil to drip off nicelyonto the site of application.If you want to take healing a step further, try blending this product with lavender oil or the Derma E Calm oil formula. Vitamin E is one of the most potent antioxidant vitamins around and it is essential to skin. It helps with the utilization of oxygen in the tissues, prevents free radical damage and can also act as a natural preservative in cosmetics.Other Uses:Dry SkinBurnsDry LipsWrinklesDamaged SkinScar Prevention~The Rebecca Review"

32914,2,"I searched for awhile before I bought these. I was sure they would be just what I wanted. Instead, these are the worst things I've ever used. HONESTLY. I can't believe people would rank them as good. First, they are like cardboard. Much thicker than you'd ever imagine and very uncomfortable stuck to your face. Second, when you want to remove them, good luck. I'm no pansy, and I've never felt such pain!! The glue is like superglue and it RIPS the facial hair out around your eyes and your forehead. I didn't know there was even hair there, but this glue found it!! And man oh man, did it HURT!! It took me several minutes of soaking through the cardboard and wetting underneath each one to get them removed and my face was beet red for the longest time afterwards. Jeez! I was going to share them with my sister but decided I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy so I threw the rest away.By the way, I have since been thinking about something that would work along these same lines and decided to try my mom's old pink hair tape. This stuff is PERFECT. Sticks well, even if you're wet, and doesn't rip the fine hairs off your face. Turns out I had the perfect wrinkle solution all along. :) I'm using the Scotch brand and love it.3m Scotch Professional Hair Set Tape With Dispenser * Created Especially For Hair StylingUPDATE: I've used the pink hair tape several times since and found that it works decent if you sleep on your back. However, the times I slept on my side and my face was bunched up, I woke up with horrific wrinkles on my crow's feet--much worse than when I used nothing! So, I'm revamping my recommendation to using a good night cream if you sleep on your side and forego the tape as well."

Some people say Tocade is dated, and I have to agree, at least at the opening.Complex? Not to me - just too much going on to make out any structure, theme or notes. It's a muddled, sweet mess on me, probably due to the deadly mix of jasmine, LOV and freesia, which I infrequently wear well. Yah, I catch the amber-vanilla base, but there's too much going on otherwise in this cloying, sweet, white floral.Rose? Orchid? Orris? Magnolia? Really?As it dries, Tocade is almost hysterically sweet and on the edge of cloying. Tocade seems to be the mother to Roucel's other over-the-top sweeties, like Lolita Lempicka's L & Coral and Dunhill Desire for Woman. Of these, I can tolerate Dunhill Desire. Hardly a ringing endorsement. Yet, I'm growing quite fond of Roucel's other affordable masterpieces - Oro & L'Instant.I've been tempted by good prices on the spaceship bottle, and I'm so glad I didn't blind buy this one. I don't like this. Not. At. All.Try it before you buy it."

4885,2,I normally use a different version of the product. The purple one which I am thinking is oil-free or something because I bought these at the store since it was all there was and they are DISGUSTING. I am surprised no one else has commented about this. It makes everything all oily. It removes the makeup great but makes me want to vom with all the oil on my fingers and face. Do you like to rub oil on your eyes? BlehI am going to see if CVS will take it back!
63699,0,"I've used this Wrinkle Defense Creme for years and have always loved it. But it seems Avalon has changed their formula and I don't think I'll be using it anymore.

135997,1,"Purchased this oil after reading about it on a website, and decided it might be worth a try after reading the reviews on Amazon. I'm really glad I did! This oil is amazing. It absorbs beautifully into the skin and isn't greasy at all. I used it head to toe after getting out of the shower and even rubbed a little on the ends of my hair. The scent is soft and very pleasant and can easily be used in place of perfume. It smells so good you won't want to cover it up with something else. My daughter loved the scent. She told me ""Mommy, you smell like potion!"" High compliment coming from a four year old! I really recommend this. I have dry skin so I can tolerate oils on my skin, but I think even someone with oily skin would like it. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin soft, not greasy."
81954,0,"I bought this because I really like the Pink Sugar perfume. It smells great, just like the perfume, but I can't figure out what the purpose of it is other than to make you smell nice. It has the consistency of a styling milk and I find it's slightly sticky when I put it on. Doesn't really leave much gloss and it doesn't moisturize. It's a nice way to wear the scent, as it does linger. I wear it instead of the perfume rather than with it, though, as it's too strong to wear them together. The lingering scent is really nice, but I think I am going to try the mousse next time."
204758,0,"Lots of people say that E.L.F's ""highlight and contour"" is a dupe for NARS' Laguna/Orgasm duo. Truly, they are not even close, in formula or color. I have uploaded a customer image of them side by side to show you just how they differ. Price wise, E.L.F. is $3 and NARS is $50.Out of the pan and swatched on your hand, both appear to have shimmer. This is because when you did that, you probably used your finger, which practically acts like a shovel. They have incredibly similar packaging and I'm sure this is intentional on E.L.F's part.*E.L.F.'s blush is so pretty and natural looking! On your hand it may appear to be sparkly but on your face it won't be. (Use a fluffy brush, not one with compact bristles, to avoid the glitter effect). However the longevity of the ELF blush is pretty short. I don't notice it still on my face when I leave work. NARS' Orgasm is a very long-lasting product but as you can see it is nowhere near the same color family as the ELF blush. I find Orgasm to be a glitterbomb on me for daytime use. I do find it's less so if I use a very fluffy brush to apply it, however I can still see bits of glitter in my pores (especially as the day wears on). This for me is a nighttime or evening color, or one I wear only if I plan on being out just for a little bit. I will say though that when I have tested the Orgasm blush through a day of work, it was still there when I went home.*The contour colors may appear to be similar but in use, they are nothing alike. The ELF product has a yellow cast to it, which tends to affect how my foundation looks throughout the course of the day. The ELF product is very powdery and transfers to a brush easily. NARS' Laguna highlighter has a less powdery formula, very firm, and you have to use a stiffer contour brush to apply it. To me this is a good thing, because I found that the ELF powder was so soft, that it was easy to over-apply it, and to apply it in places I didn't necessarily want it to be. The NARS Laguna felt more precise. Also, the Laguna did not tonally change my foundation look, which is very important to me. I'm pasty-pale, I probably shouldn't even be playing with bronzer, but I have been and I don't want it to look like war paint.*I used the blush products on my eyelids as a base, and the contour colors on my crease, for a cohesive `natural' look. This worked well with the ELF blush and NARS Laguna contour. The ELF blush and contour didn't look very nice, since the ELF contour color is so yellow. By midafternoon my eyes looked very grody and I had to fix it with another color. When I used the Orgasm/Laguna duo, the Orgasm's pink color on my lids really brought out the fact that I have redness in my skin. It looked horrible. The ELF blush and Laguna bronzer though, paired nicely.In no way, shape or form are these two palettes interchangeable for each other, no matter what you read elsewhere. Just look at the color differences in the photos, and imagine just how different they are on your face! My advice would be to TRY the E.L.F. if you can get it cheap locally, and see how you like it before you fork out $50 for a NARS palette. I wish now that I had just bought the Laguna bronzer by itself since it would have been cheaper, and in general the Orgasm is NOT my favorite blush. (Deep Throat is nice, not as much glitter or brightness). I keep both of these palettes because I like the blush from E.L.F. and the Laguna from NARS."
155436,1,I enjoyed this book. I don't like to read so I miss out a lot but having the books on CD makes it possible for me to enjoy a good book. This book was very helpful to me in all aspects of my life.
141262,0,"This dye was easy to mix and apply, but required a LOT longer processing time to get a color that was not olive green. There is no taking it off early for a lighter brown with this kit. I have BLOND almost invisible brows and have been dyeing them myself for a long time. Once you get to the dark brown, almost black color it looks natural and so far has stayed on for over 2 weeks, but is starting to fade at this point."
200812,2,"It works OK, but it is definitely NOT a compact travel model. This is one of the few situations where I wish I had dragged myself to a store. If I had seen how big this beast is, I never would have bought it."
33580,0,"Unfortunately, I didn't realize that there is a serum AND a lotion version of this product. Not paying attention, I ordered this because it was 2.5oz versus the 1.7oz size. I do not care for the lotion version. My skin feels greasy like I put body lotion on it and I can only stand to wear it at night. Unless you have dry skin, I do not recommend the lotion version. My skin felt much better with the serum-I have combination skin. Hopefully, I will get the same fantastic results I had with the serum."
154460,0,"The Beauty Blender is super soft, and that's my favorite thing about it. That's also really the only difference between it and another blending sponge. You get the same results. It's great for the eye area because it applies makeup so gently. I don't know whether its worth the price though yet.I washed it a few times now and each time the dye has bled. Not liking that.The first time, the dye bled a lot. Now the sponge is a lighter pink color.Im also starting to feel like it takes less time to just use my hand/fingers for foundation application then using this. Eiether way you get nice results."
196803,1,This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It is smooth and so fast. I have my hair done in so much less time than before with my old flat iron.Love it.
45980,0,"This cleanser is wonderfully gentle and soothing for my sensitive, mildly-pink skin (rosacea), but it did absolutely nothing to remove facial makeup, even after three times trying. I'd consider using it just for mornings, but it's a bit too pricey for that, and I prefer to use as few products on my skin as possible.That said, this cleanser did not irritate my skin or turn it red, so it is an excellent option for Rosies. I did not use the wipe-off option because wiping a cotton pad across my skin is irritating, but it rinsed relatively easily.If you don't wear makeup and you have sensitive, dry skin, this would be a a very gentle cleanser, but I wear makeup, and the cleanser was too gentle to take off my face! I prefer Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil, which cleanses (even eye makeup) and moisturizes in one step, even my oily T zone, with no need for toner afterward."
79678,0,i honestly thought that this product would be better than what it is. it doesnt moisturize my hair as much as i would like it too. and it doesnt make it any easier to untangle it. im actually a little disappointed. i have very curly hair so therefore i need the moisture this product however didnt work as wellas i thought it would.
114441,2,"This is my favorite pwerfume for the past 12 years and this Dolce & Gabbana does not even smell....It has no scent at all. This is waste of my money!!!! Very Disappointed. I wish I could send it back and get my money, this is like plain water with color. I'm very unhappy with it. I just ordered another Doilce & Gabbana from the website I usually buy it from. I paid for dirty water. Not HAPPY!!!!!!"
246119,1,These are great combs! They stay put and I have very thick hair! A bit pricey but I will buy more.
138317,2,"I bought this because I had used some samples that really seemed to be effective after just 3 weeks, but when my purchase arrived in the mail, not only was the consistency different from the sample, I began to notice that the small amount of hair growth I had experienced from using the sample, went away and I started losing even more hair. The shampoo did seem to help hinder hair loss, which is why I give it two stars, but the treatment 'gel' has left me with significantly less hair after 6 months. I don't want to risk losing more, so I stopped using it. I was concerned that what was in the bottle wasn't the same thing as what was in the sample. Wish I could get a refund and get my hair back."
250857,1,"This wall mounted mirror is excellent value. The mirror itself is a good size, it is not heavy and easily mounted onto the wall. The extension arm seems a little stiff but I expect a little oil spray will fix that. Delivery was quick, I received the product within 7 days. Overall I am very, very happy with my purchase."

204434,0,"I bought this for a date. I find it to be VERY sticky and waxy, unlike the Cinnamon Buns gloss. And wouldn't want to kiss anyone wearing this. Smells nice, tastes ok and does moisturize. Good for when you don't plan on kissing or wearing your hair down. Oh, and the date worked out. ;-D"
150463,1,Love Caswell- Massey and their Carmichaels and have used this for over 30 years - hands and feet. Highly recommended!
216490,1,I have been wearing Acqua Di Gio since it first came out and still appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fragrance. I frequently get complimented on this fragrance.
156757,2,I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase.
39220,0,"When I first smelled a sample of this, my first thought was ""HAVE TO HAVE IT"". I rushed out and bought this a couple of days later. First of all, the scent goes away like in 1 hour or less. I just got sick of it and out of my entire fragrance collection this is at the bottom of my list. The scent is also TOO fruity, like cheap body spray. I once smelled it on someone else and thought it was way too overpowering. It is a bad version of Cool Waters (Davidoff)."
232840,0,"My fault, I thought this was going to come out a bit pink on my lips, however it seems to come out pretty much clear. It's alright, I still use it but I just thought it was going to be more shimmery."
135153,1,"Okay, I am so lovin' that I bought these. I did my compared shopping on Amazon and saw these had the best reviews. I have NEVER in my 35 years of life, used curlers. I have always had a short hairdo or some kind of bob-do that didn't need any kind of curling. Now, I have long layered hair and it usually ends up in a pony-tail. Well, I am tired of the easy pull-back look. Thank goodness a friend suggested rollers/curlers. All I can say is 'WoW', these have made my hair-life easy. They are easy and fast, really fast. Once they arrived in the mail, I wanted to try them out, however I am a busy mom, so I decided I would start dinner, then plug the curlers in. While I was cooking, I ran into the bathroom to set my hair and after about 5 minutes of heat-up, I began to roll my hair. The rollers grasp on smooth, the clips are effective. After I clipped each one, I went back to the kitchen to finish making dinner. While at the stove, I set the timer for 10 minutes, to let the curlers set and cool. After the buzzer went off, I went back to take them out. The style and curls were amazing. However, I do need to point out that my hair was styled from earlier in the day, so I did have some product in my hair. All-in-all, it only took me a few minutes of prep-time. Since I have longer hair, the 5 curlers had to be set on two sections of my hair, at different times. Only takes 2-5 minutes to warm in the warmer and about 2-5 minutes to roll hair, then 10 minutes to sit and cool. During the ten minutes of setting/cooling, you can run around the house and get chores done. EASY!! My only complaint would be, I wish there were 10 curlers, instead of 5."
247616,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
238591,2,this stuff smells HORRIBLE!!! it was a good price but i cannot stand the smell. not to mention there is no sort of seal on the top so who knows if the liquid inside is what its supposed to be.
154933,0,"I loved the original DIORISSIMO perfume by Christian Dior. This version has hardly any fragrance and the ingredients seem to be different. I don't think it has any Lily of the Valley in it any more, which used to be the main ingredient."
190435,0,"Bought as a Mother's Day gift for my wife. I didn't notice this when I received it, but apparently the package was open and the perfume was slightly used (she noticed it after I gave it to her). She liked the scent so much that she didn't want me to return it and wait for a replacement. First time this has ever happened to me with an Amazon product. Maybe it'll never happen again, but you might want to look more closely than I did, especially if it's a gift..."

223043,2,"I really didn't care for this perfume at all. The notes were extremely masculine to me, and frankly I didn't feel there was anything too unique about it. I think Burberry in general smells wonderful on men, but I have yet to find a perfume of theirs that I would wear."
154825,0,"Revlon RV444C Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic, Blackseveral years ago my daughter baught one of these to try out; from that moment on I was hooked, it did everything I needed it to do to get the job done beautifully. Unfortunately it soon burned out. Again; not too long after the perchase of my secound as well as the third styler the bristles receded into the barrel. I have tried others but none seem to do the job as well. In my opinion, they need to fix this issue, minimumly make the brushes available as a separate perchase."
15216,0,"The product didn't exactly work for me. My ingrowns are still the same, even if I do exfoliate and apply twice a day. Maybe it works differently for everyone. However, I was glad that it sort of lightened the dark spots."
42479,0,I don't really have anything bad to say about the product itself. I should have read it better. It's less than an ounce of product. The smell is wonderful and I love it. I haven't noticed a difference in my dry skin though so that's why I only gave it three stars.

247855,2,"With so many high reviews that this product got, I completely ignored the handful of them that warned of theories that it may be a tampered with product. I mean, how can something with 100+ reviews that mostly ships directly from Amazon be a knockoff. Well, a week in to owning this, and I'm 90% sure this is not a legit bottle of Nautica Voyage cologne.The first day or two was amazing. The cologne smells extremely fresh and aquatic and lasted all the way through the day without issue. I was actually able to smell it clearly on my shirt at the end of the day. That all changed by the 3rd use. The smell was still good, but seemed not as potent and dissipated drastically about 15 minutes after application, at least compared to how it was the first few times. This morning came as shock. Out of curiosity, I sprayed it on at took a deep whiff. The smell was pure alcohol, a sort of vodka smell, and then only a slight hint of the actual cologne. It's now a few hours later, and I do smell the cologne on my shirt, but it's a fraction of what it should be.Essentially, I think I got what I paid for: a $15 bottle of cologne. It truly does seem that the spray and tube did indeed have the actual cologne in it when I first got it, but the liquid in the bottle has been watered down with some alcohol. I'll continue to use this for work, because in it's preset form, it's extremely subtle and not intrusive. However, I can't wear it for special occasions or nights out. It's nothing more to me than a decent knockoff. It unfortunately is worth it's discounted price and not a penny more. Do yourself a favor, pony up a few more bucks and buy your cologne from a reliable brick and mortar store, lest you run the risk of getting a tampered with bottle like me."
175124,0,"A. the color of the bottle when received is not a brilliant blue as pictured. its a rather deep amber color.B. the keynote is NOT bitter orange. in fact there is hardly any citrus scent in my bottle. the Vanilla is extremely overpowering. Not subtle, like i feel vanilla should be. when first applied, the perfume is ridiculously strong, like burn nostrils within the first spray.but i'll have to admit it lasts and actually forms a pleasing smell, thus not a complete waste.albeit i was really looking for a whole different scent then what i received. i really wanted a more unique beachy feel from what the description was on both this website and on [...].regardless, if you like the strong vanilla smell. go for it. bc you'll actually find a perfume with a pleasing vanilla flavor that lasts. =)"
121548,2,"When I bought these fake lashes, I was expecting at least a minimum level of quality...

74683,0,"This review is for the Coconut Hand and Body Lotion. The Shikai lotions are nice on the skin and they are thicker like a body butter or body creme. I also appreciate that they do not use parabens and the like. There IS a Coconut scent to this one but it is more of a soft Coconut/Vanilla scent. Very pleasing, however as there is no real coconut oil in the product that was dissapointing. (Could be do to the fact that coconut oil does not have a long shelf life and Shakai opts out of many of the more toxic preservatives.) They do have some great healing ingredients like wheat germ, avacado oil, shea butter and borage seed oil, however due to the fact that the lotion IS PURE WHITE and none of these listed ingredients in their more natural - AND MOST BENEFICIAL STATE - are white in color then it is obvious that they have heavily refined the ingredients leaving only a fraction of the botanical actives from many of these fabulous plants. Still has a nice aroma and leaves the skin soft for a couple of hours at least.(Will not last on supper dupper dry skin. For that you will need a quality unrefined body oil or body butter, or just use 100% virgin coconut oil!)"

132009,2,"Well i bought it over christmas (i'm of italian, spainish & black decent btw) it makes my hair shiny & soft but doesn't control my frizz. (which is suppose to) I followed the direction on the bottle & the online videos but it still came out even worse then before. My hair looks even more terrible. My hair is natually thick but has a wavy,curly texture i wanted something that kept my wavy curls but helped frizz. I'm so disappointed. I've heard so much good things about the product it really ticks me off that it worked better on my grandmothers hair she has no frizz her hair is like a white person's but it's curly. It made me wonder if i used it right i did like it said in the video the girl in the video had the kind of texture of hair i did but it didn't work on me. :("
98274,1,"One of my coworkers was wearing this, and I told him I ""had to ask"" what he was wearing. I promptly ordered it for my son, who is now enamored as well. (He just asked me to add it to his Christmas list for this year.) Incredible scent!"
136958,2,I bought this and I use it for a month. I din't notice any change on my face. I'm 38 years and i have small wrinkles around my eyes and my mouth. I also bought the night cream. Overall i looked like bathe in oil. Dont waste the money. It too greasy.
109940,2,There is just one wick inside. The picture is fake.The picture shows a cartoon of wick. But you just received one wick.
11714,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
5408,2,"Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and ""day cream"" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)"
43415,1,"This is without a doubt the best perfume I have ever used. I am allergic to many others but because of the light fragrance I am able to use it without any problems. I have been buying this for at least 10 years and get more compliments than I can begin to tell you, both men and women. Great for day or evening, I highly recommend Jessica McClintock."
19986,0,"I love my 1 1/4"" Hot Tools curling iron (purchased from Ulta) and decided to purchase the 1"" from Discount Jungle. I was excited to receive it, but when I plugged my curling iron (for the 1st time) it was emitting a burning odor. I used it maybe 3-4 x hoping it would go away, but it didn't. As stated previously, I currently own a HT curling iron and works well with no problems and shouldn't be giving off this odor. I contacted DJ & they sent a replacement. Sadly, that too was giving off a burning smell. Because I don't want to deal with the hassle of paying for shipping (again) & waiting for it (again), I am going to keep it, even though I am worried about safety. I will just keep my eye on it. Oh, well."
139880,1,This tiny brush is perfect because i have really thin hair and it is so tiny it fits in little bags.

118664,1,"Not a single qualm about the product, but if some of these deals on Amazon seem too good to be true, there's reason to practice caution. I purchased this after reading the fine print carefully. No mention was made about the size, but since it was ""reduced"" from $18 retail (full size price), I ordered it. Alas, what arrived was .14 oz small travel size Mineral Veil. I was disappointed, but learned my lesson: be very careful with some of these prices and sellers. Won't be fooled again."

110857,2,"While the lotion did absorb well and left my skin extremely soft, the patchouli oil was overpowering. The scent lasted forever and any clothing, linens and furniture I came in contact with also smelled of patchouli. My husband didn't care for the lotion either. If you like the scent of patchouli, this lotion would be perfect because the scent lasts all day (and all week if you don't do laundry right away). I do, however, love Kiss My Face products and would definitely use their lotions in other scents."
102713,2,I ordered this for my wife. I knew is was only 4 oz but it seemed even smaller. For the price it is not worth it. My wife liked the smell but the results were horrible. Would never purshase this again.

I don't want to waste my time to go to the post office etc just for a few bucks. but it really is disappointing. The one love scent is too sweet and like cheap lipsticks from one dollar store...."
157415,1,"This product is AMAZING! The color was sooo gradual and soooo even no one could even tell it was fake. It is such a natural brown color def. not orange whatsoever. I usually dont like lotion self tanners bc i prefer the spray bc the lotion gets inbetween fingers and never looks even but this def does not! It is an even color and at first when i pumped it my initial reaction was ""ew"" bc of the tar like look to it but it is the best products ive ever used i will never use nething else! and i only used about 4 or 5 pumps of the lotion for my whole body so i barely used any which is also great.

This guy in tuxedo (probably going to a fomal party there) sniffed, looked around (for flowers?)and remarked to his lady companion:hmmm...where are the flowers?

221784,2,"An excellent idea, very poorly executed in the form of a large, clunky appliance. The plates are more than twice the thickness of a standard straightening iron, making for a cumbersome, awkward, product. If you have hair any shorter than shoulder length, you are guaranteed burned ears, neck and fingers trying to get your hair into the plates.The curling iron portion of it actually sits atop the plates, so think at least twice the thickness of a regular curling iron to wrap around. No skinny little twists here!The 'hot air' is hot but there's not much of it, and if you are very patient it will dry your hair as you ever.so.slowly. drag it down your head.People with long, not overly curly, not overly thick hair, may find this useful, but otherwise stick with your blow dryer and seperate straightening iron for better results."

167313,0,"Bought because it was dual voltage. But it went kaput after few days using in 220-250V range with 50Hz freq. Not sure if it was a sudden death due voltage surge or a slow death due to few days of 50hz freq..3 stars because I guess it would have worked for few years in 110V, 60Hz U.S"
142770,0,"As much as I love Prevage, this version caused an allergic reaction on my nect and face. This version is so strong, even one drop mixed with water still caused me to go red and swollen. Everyone is different, so if your not allergic, then it is a wonderful product. Just be cautious when using."
126433,2,My scalp itched terriby after using. I must be allergic to something in the shampoo & wish I had not ordered it.
79702,1,"This is a really nice, thick conditioner. It definitely hydrates your hair, and is suitable for dry, curly, or damaged hair. It smells good, although the scent doesn't linger. On Amazon, it's available at a MUCH better price than at drugstores, where it can cost $5-$7 more for the 10 oz tube. I like how you can purchase it in a much larger tub, and I plan on doing so once I run out of my 10 oz container."

120275,0,"Although my product arrived in good time and in great condition, the cologne itself didnt smell good. It has a very amoniated smell to it. I'm sure it was because it was older cologne that is not really in sales anymore so I'm not really worried about getting my money back. Not everything smells the same after 15 yrs LOL."

194512,0,"I picked this because of the color. And, the color is true. And unlike other China Glaze, the product was quite thin, spread unevenly with the brush in the cap (although with a detail brush it came out o.k.), and required several coats for good coverage. Oh, and it's not glossy, it's a flat finish."
19242,2,"I've been a Bare Escentuals BareMinerals user for about a decade. I usually buy direct, either from the store or online through the store's website. The last time I was out, I decided to check Amazon and ended up buying this. Unfortunately, the product I received through Amazon did not have the right consistency nor the right coverage that I've come to expect of the real BareMinerals.Recently, the real Bare Escentuals had a no shipping fee special so I ordered a container direct from them to compare. Right away, I became even more suspicious of the Amazon sold makeup. There are subtle marking differences between the two containers; the kinds of things you might expect a counterfeiter to get wrong. Also, when I shook out the two out side by side, the makeup in the Amazon container is significantly drier and lighter.If this is not the real BareMinerals, and truthfully I don't think it is, then I worry about what I was putting on my face for those few weeks. :-(Caveat emptor. If you want the real BareMinerals, I suggest buying direct from Bare Escentuals or via one of their stores. If you want a fake, your local drugstore has several knock-off mineral brands that are properly labeled (and even cheaper)."

33782,0,"My husband loves gardenia. I like it too. I actually fell in love with White Gardenia Petals, but found it too pricey for my budget, so I was looking for another option and decided to try this one. The best thing about this fragrance is that it is in a non-alcohol base which I really like as I often have an allergic reaction to the perfume department, and have found that anything in an oil base that I can control without spraying in the air is a pretty safe bet for my sensitive system. The scent is somehow a little off for me. Sometimes it reminds me of pine, especially when I first put it on. I have that kind of body chemistry though. No fragrance smells like you would expect on me. I change every fragrance. I always wait to see if anyone comments that I smell good. So far, no one has stopped me mid-hug to comment on my fragrance. I probably won't buy it again, but, even using it daily, it is going to last for a long long time."

In addition to helping a little with the dry eye stuff, it doesn't sting and takes off eye makeup great."
56076,2,"Well, I am not sure what all the hype was about. First of all, I LOVE Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City, so I was excited to hear of her perfume. Just by her personality I thought I would like it, and then I saw it on Oprah and couldn't wait to smell it. I finally made it to Macy's, and I must say I was disappointed. I thought it would smell maybe a little more citrus like, and a little less musk like. I put a little on and my roommate said it smelled a little like a man. I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it without smelling it and making sure it is for you first!"
205163,0,"Bijan's nude isn't the best cologne out there but for the price it isn't quite bad. I would describe this as a fresh out of the shower type of scent. I get a smooth yet strong,soapy kind of smell from this. It reminds me of Le male when it dries down. So for the price I would say why not buy this. I will probably be wearing this during the day on weekends when I go to the gym. I would not wear this for any special occasion though."
239507,0,The size of the product was bigger than what my mom usually gets so she got more for the money but the problem was that the smell didn't last like the ones she has been wearing for like 10+ years. She likes the size but the smell doesn't last long or is strong enough.
198892,0,"I would give this product 3 1/2 stars if I could. I had this straightener for about 2 1/2 years before it stopped working. It worked amazing while it worked, but it always seemed cheaply made. This was my first Chi product and was surprised by the low quality of it. However, as I said it worked very well when it worked."
60360,0,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love the nail polish. Not to mention - the price cannot be beat! It was of the quality I expected BUT it was different than the one I had at home. I had bought it at the nail salon and fell in love with it. It goes on very sheer with a nice shimmer and is great for the summer, however, the one I had at home is not as pink as the one I ordered. So, if you're looking for a color that you already have don't be surprised if the one you order on line is a bit different. I have to say though, for the price, the slight difference in color is not a big deal."
98160,0,"I've been using the spray for almost a month now. It has not made any of my acne go away (used on chest and shoulders). Honestly, it brought out more acne and it looks a little worse now. It could be my imagination but it does seem like the acne looks lighter, but the fact that the amount of acne on my body nearly doubled after using this is kind of upsetting. I just ran out of this yesterday, so in case you're wondering, the spray bottle lasts about 3 weeks.I will add on that I just purchased the body wash version of this. I really want the acne gone, and Neutrogena products have a 100% failure rate with me but there are so many good reviews that I want to at least try it. If I remember, i'll update with the results of the body wash in a few weeks.Update: I've been using the Body Wash since I got it, it's been 3 days so far. Already I can see a difference. The spray made my body acne a bit worse, and this is certainly fighting it off. The color of the acne is slowly fading off, and remember it's only been 3 days! I can certainly imagine after the bottle reaches empty point, that there will be a significant difference.My recommendation is to NOT buy the spray, It's a waste of money. The body wash works great, and seems like it will last longer. Also, it has 4x the amount of saltyic acidUpdate 6/16/12: I can safely say i've been using the body was for over 2 months. Results are actually not there. It seemed to be working, but after a short while it made everything worse than it was before I even started. I'm never buying a Neutrogena acne product again."
94677,1,"I'm a mid-twenties boss, I need a mid-twenties boss cologne.I find myself, however, drawn to the 'older' scents like Polo Green. I think this was formulated in 1986 or something. This smells like an older scent, but definitely one I like. The spray is quite massive, and the strength of the cologne is strong - 2 sprays max will do you in.It settles in quite nicely. Dark, spicy, semi-musky smell. It's not clean and refreshing like Acqua or Chanel Bleau so make sure this is the type of smell you're going for.I personally stock one dark and one light smell in my cologne spot.Anyway, overall, it was a good blind buy. Will last a long time and could be used as a daily scent."
10476,2,"I ordered the 1.7 EDP. Was sent the 3.4 EDT. Very dissapointed. If I would have wanted the EDT I could have gotten it for much cheaper from a different seller. I wanted the EDP because it is stronger. I did not bother to send back because I had been waiting for it, and didn't want to have to wait a few weeks longer."
40915,0,"I liked the Daily Illuminating Face Lotion enough to buy a full sized bottle. The Quench Body Lotion, however, has that nasty self-tanner fragrance (is anybody out thare in the cosmetics world paying attention? This stuff smells B-A-D!) The bonus eye pillow is silly, but has a nice lavendar fragrance. It's just a rectangle with a satiny fabric on one side and a flannel on the other, and tends to slip right off my face."
137418,0,"I do like the nail polish but the color is SO metallic it ends up looking a bit grey. The formula is also very very thin, but I like it. I prefer it to something to thick. the coats will dry fast so nothing to worry about. its a nice color, I just wish it was more black rather than grey. A good buy. I would recommend it, but not for a black nail polish. maybe for a dark metallic grey."
101808,0,"I've been dealing with acne for some time, trying a variety of creams, astringents, masques, face washes, etc. I've used proactiv and Acne Free systems for several months now. I usually prefer acne treatment products that don't contain Salicylic acid, instead getting better results with benzoyl peroxide products. Both have their drawbacks and you should try both to see which works better for you then others.I'm going to focus on the second step as representative of the system in general. While these systems are designed to be all in one, which seems convenient initially, what happens to me anyway, is that the three products run out at different times. You can find some kind of balance by buying new kits or if the manufacturer is kind, separately, but it is still annoying to run out of a step out of sync before the others. Typically I run out the second step in these kits, usually a kind of astringent to remove dead skin cells and other contaminants. This has been my experience so far using Nature's Gate.It also has a fairly strong smell, that smell odorous at first, but eventually something to get used to. Each container contains a flip top, similar to what you might find on some brands of hair products. It works fine with step 1 and 3 liquids, but works poorly in step two. Perhaps mine is defective, but it leaks a small amount of liquid after dispensing. The only solution is to unscrew the entire cap and carefully dab some on a cotton pad.Also be careful not to use too much of step one, it is highly concentrated, so only a few drops will clean your face well. Too much and it will be difficult rinse off entirely.Overall I think Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment system has been useful, but will go back to using Acne Free Products. The Salicylic Acid and other ingredients doesn't keep my skin as clear as Benzoyl peroxide products."
200215,2,"Well, I flubbed up this time. I came across ""Hope In a BOTTLE"", not ""Jar"" and used it. It did MIRACLES for my skin. So, I thought I'd get gutsy and bought Hope In a Jar. Boy, was that mistake. I put in on, and my face turned BEET RED and starting BURNING. My eyes watered, my nose watered. OMG it was horrible. Areas on my face that had a little too much were BLISTERED. Be careful ladies."
20912,1,"This was my sister's signature scent from the time she was around 18 years old. I remember seeing this on her vanity dresser among other perfumes, but it was Ciara 200 that was her favorite. Her first cologne was White Shoulders when she was 14 years old. These two cologne's are key for me when I think of her. They represent her youthful force of nature/BEAUTY. She is the SUN, and when Ciara is in the air it is Patti I think of, with love."
111654,0,"I have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years, and they worked well 75% during that time. My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush. The buttons moved easily, and the dryer's handle was comfortable to grip.The demise of these dryers was pretty much the same: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here. Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal. I considered buying a third, but having generated sparks with the last two, I opted to purchase a different brand. Overall, if you don't mind the potential electrical danger, it's a decent dryer for the price."
202129,1,"I have heavy, wavy hair and this product is my lifesaver! It does not add any more weight to my hair, it defines the curls better and it makes the frizz go away! I have been looking for this for a while, and I was so happy when I saw amazon had it! I will keep on buying this product!"
48263,2,"I love the SMELL of this shampoo, but that's all I love. After using this daily for a month, I found that my scalp was developing patches of oily crust - using the same technique for shampooing that I always use. I was glad when it was gone and won't buy it again."
128690,0,"I received a gift box of this product and other Curve colognes years ago as a teen, this was one of my favorites and also one that I got a lot of complements on. I'm now a young adult and am searching for nice colognes to wear on dates and to work so I purchased this. After years of not having it I was excited to try it again. I sprayed it on and was hit by the same aroma I used to smell as a teen, however as the day went on the scent faded away to nothing. Maybe I just got used to the smell, but when I was a teen I only had the sample bottle (about 1 oz) and I would apply the equivalent to one spray onto my neck and I could smell it and got compliments the entire day so I don't believe that is it. This lasts about a hour. I usually work around women so I use them as tests (unknowingly lol) for my cologne, I also use Curve Connect and I get the most compliments on that throughout the entire day, but this...nothing. I don't want to use Connect for work because to me the smell is too intimate and should only be used on dates so I'm searching for a nice cologne for work. Something a bit sweet but masculine would work for me. It smells nice to me and I know it smells good to women but I am disappointed on it's poor duration. I will try two sprays next time and see if the duration and strength increases without over doing it. The smell is very nice and I do not want this to go to waste."
181233,1,"It does create a barrier against your skin, but unless you reapply it after two or more hours it losses it effectiveness. I used it to keep soy based ink from getting under my nails and to wash off the ink easier. I will say it helped me cut the washing of my hands down by 3/4th the time and it did keep the ink from under my nails. I will use it again."

A few facial expressions later and, voila!, you have the border AND the wrinkle. Don't waste your money."
36529,0,"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it."

90914,0,"You only need about a pea sized amount for the entire face. I found it creamy and moisturizing without being greasy. Sinks in quickly. The finished look was quite matte. After about an hour, my face didn't feel quite as moisturized anymore. My complaint is that for this price, you should be moisturized all day long (like my unrefined shea butter does and for 1/10th of the cost). I definitely feel that this product is priced way too high for what it delivers."
240937,2,"Very disappointed!! After many years of buying this cologne, I figured that this was the real cologne but it is certainly not.

126651,0,"This is a nice ""okay"" fragrance. It's only draw back is that it doesn't have staying power unless you use a lot. Cologne shouldn't arrive before you do - but I like to know that it's there.I smelled the cologne on a co-worker who is from Sierra Leone. Oddly enough, it was because he sprayed a tad too much - which is how I came to notice it. Now I understand why he over did it a bit.As a side note; this same guy told me something interesting. This fragrance is by a French designer. My co-worker told me that once a cologne/parfum crosses an ocean, it changes it's scent. He said that it is a known mystery. Can anyone validate this?"
1300,0,According to the description the shade of this liner is not black or brown - it's mahogany. Let's be clear - it's dark brown.Cake liners have always been difficult for me but this one is particularly so. It goes on more easily wet than dry. When a dry application was tried there was either not enough color or so much that it smudged.As for the therapy - where does that come in????

241814,2,"I am a Nexxus Versastyler user for 10 years and the product that was in this bottle was not the same product I have been using. It looks exactly like the bottle I have always purchased in the past but the product I like is thin, clear and watery. I have thin hair and cannot use a heavy product. The thin, clear watery kind did not weigh my hair down and allowed me to style it and the style would stay all day. This product is heavy and leaves like a soap residue on my hair. When you rinse your hands after using this product, it actually creates bubbles in the sink as if you just washed your hands with soap. When I curl my hair with a curling iron, my hair just wants to flop and go flat. It is way to heavy and makes it hard to even separate your hair to curl it with a curling iron. I definitely do not like this product and will have to be careful in the future when purchasing it. I thought the bottle labeled Nexxus Versastyler Designing Lotion with the dispenser nozzle you push down on had this thick liquid in, not this bottle that you have to turn on its side to allow the liquid to pour into your hand, that is the type of bottle I always purchased and it had my favorite product in it. This bottle is deceiving."
36898,0,"This was my fourth, and thus far, my favorite hair straightener, purchased in the U.S.The GOOD:I have super-long hair (down to my waist), and my hair tends to frizz, so straightening it can be tough. With this Conair though, I was able to straighten it to sleek and smooth, in a reasonable amount of time. All irons can damage, and Wet/Dry irons tend to be more damaging, so I never ironed full length of my hair damp; however, I did use it very successfully on damp bangs, when in a rush, and the rest of my hair was tied up. I never noticed any damage, but I trim my bangs often.The auto shut-off feature saves me from having to go back home, when I'm heading to work and suddenly can't remember if I've turned off the iron.Other pros: It heats up quickly, has adjustable heat settings, indicates when it's ready vs. in heating mode, it never once snagged my hair, and it's reasonably priced.The SAD:I've had it for about a year. Yesterday, it died out of the blue - conveniently when I was trying to get ready for an event. I turned it on, and it just blinked as though it was in heating mode, but never got hot.I also have noticed some extra split ends. This is despite being very careful about heat protection and not straightening all of my hair every day (only the bangs). That's to be expected with heat styling, I guess.Still, I was all set to buy another, but stores don't seem to carry it anymore. I turned to Amazon, and took a few minutes to read through other reviews... just out of curiosity. I'm thankful I did.The BAD:As many other reviewers have experienced and attested, the suddenly-stops-heating-up-after-about-a-year issue is typical of this iron. I'm adding my same experience to the list.I checked out some other Conair models, and they seem to die similarly.I definitely won't be purchasing another Conair. I'm not keen on investing another $35-$40 to have it conk out (again) within a year."

124709,2,"It's too rough and doesn't produce foam like other pairs of exfoliating shower gloves do. Additionally, the color shown is not the color I received. I reported this to the seller with no response. The color I got was a feminine sea-green."
73477,2,If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too. Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage. My hair became so brittle I had flyaways all over the place from the breaking. The exact same thing happened to my sister's hair and she's not happy with me as you can imagine. If you want to risk your hair go for it but I wish someone had let me know about the damage this shampoo causes before I bought it. I started using Avalon Biotin thickening shampoo after I tossed this product out. Not only is it less expensive but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back. Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin.

83136,2,the tip snags hair and it doesnt hold color well. my least favorite brush ever
204125,0,"Absorption is adequate, but leaves a feeling of residue. Hydration is above average but nothing like what other reviews are raving about. The worst part about this product is that it leaves you smelling like a piece of Juicy Fruit gum, overwhelmingly so. I suspect the hemp oil additive is not very high. Reading the ingredients would make the organic hippie types faint - huge list of additives. So so lotion products like Aveeno are much shorter on chemicals.PLEASE SEE my newly included photo of ingrediants. Photo Notes - shamelessly included some text from this review.Overpriced too.I see Supre now have a Snookie line of tanning products. Wow, that's class. Do you suppose Snookie cares about the environment and natural products like Supre does?I much prefer Eucerin products like Smoothing Essentials or Calming Creme with oatmeal - both absorb incredibly well without residue, with excellent hydrating qualities.Been meaning to try Nivea products, they get the highest marks at ConsumerSearch dotcom > search 'lotion'> love their aggregate reviews scores from multiple qualified professionals."

199059,0,The product was a gift and was received in a timely manner and appears to be working fine. My concern is that there is no manufacturer's warranty which I didn't realize at the time of purchase. I e-mailed my concern to Top Beauty who quickly responded that they are very clear about their 30 day warranty to which I agree. I just don't understand why the manufacturer doesn't warrant the flat iron unless it is not authentic or is a second. I would have paid more for the product to get the manufacturer's year warranty had I realized that it was not offered. Top Beauty should make that fact as clear as they do about their 30 day warranty!!!!

I suggest if you spray this, 1 spray is enough or you can spray your clothes a day ahead before wearing it so by the time you have to wear your clothes, it wouldn't be too overpowering."

Not a very good ""every day"" product. I actually got a zit AFTER using the product. If you insist on using this stuff, use paper towels to dry your face!"
204094,1,I am amazed at how great Dr. Christopher's Ointment Complete Tissue is.I noticed a difference in the way my legs felt after the 2nd or 3rd time using it. I will continue to get this product. It really helps with leg cramps and pain.
105685,0,"Got it this week from Target, but had points, so I didn't pay full price.I actually like it better than the GVP (CHI knock off) I bought from Sally's. And I REALLY liked that one.I only gave it 4 stars, because I see it broke on some people within a year (**** update, this has happened to me, so I don't use this iron as much anymore. I am also relaxed now.*****).Originally, I like it because it straightens my natural hair very well and I don't seem to redo it as often, which is nice. It was every day with the GVP. Now it's only been every 2 or 3 days. All I have to do is wrap my hair. I also use it between 300 & 370 degrees. I also used a heat protectant with it, Beyond The Zone and Sabino Moisture Block. With this iron, I have a feeling I won't have to use it as often, or apply product all the time.So, so far, so good."

5606,2,"I've used other products from Sexy Hair Concepts that I liked so I thought I would like this one too. I already have stick straight hair but I just wanted a nice shampoo so I can't really comment on whether or not this would make your hair straighter.As a shampoo, it was mediocre. It was okay but it didn't smell good and I don't feel like it really cleaned my hair that well. I feel like it made my hair feel thicker but in a dry way that left my hair feeling like hay."
89258,1,This is a great dryer. Dries my hair very fast and seems to help with static electricity. It's a little pricey but if you have long hair it's worth it.
41447,0,The concept is a good one. The dryer is cumbersome. The cord is long but somewhat heavy. I have curly hair. It takes a lot of work and time to straighten the hair without it getting big. Women with curly hair will understand what I mean.

163955,2,This product was supposed to come from a company. The product was supposed to be new. Instead it came from an individual. The package was not sealed with cellophane as new Paul Sebastian products are packaged. The box containing the bottle of cologne was well used.I suspect the cologne was an item from someone's home and was watered down as the fragrance was weak. I began using Paul Sebastian in the 90s but I will buy the product in a store from now on.I will not use this product since it has been compromised. I will consider the money spent for this product wasted. I would return it but don't want to waste more money in shipping cost.

Also, coloring in the darker shades, uses only 20 volume creme activator, which make thin hair coated with color, shine, and gives it volume. COLOR YOUR HAIR A DARKER SHADE FOR SHINE!"

77290,2,"Shalimar is the only perfume/cologne I wear, mainly because my husband loves it. I ordered this because it was sold by Amazon and not an Amazon merchant, and it was a great price. I opened it today and it is either fake, or a very old bottle. It doesn't smell at all like Shalimar. I am not worried that Amazon will refund my money, just disappointed that I have to hassle with getting a refund. I ordered it going by the positive reviews, so maybe this was just a fluke. Still, ""buyer beware!"""
121086,1,"Love this. I have been considering using henna powder but this seemed less complicated so I tried it. purchased 2 bottles. Have natural 4b hair. first experience, did not wash hair first, applied w dye brush from root to tip.. put on plastic cap and left for 1 hour. when I rinsed it the hair felt smooth, cuticles lying down, but then I washed with a clarifying shampooo and it intstantly made my hair very dry and coarse. had to use a conditioner w a lot of slip to smooth cuticle back down. minimal coloring but it was ok. Second time, thrillledddd w the result. Sectioned, detangled, braided in large sections and washed, towel dried and applied section by section w dye brush, put on 2 plastic caps and a knit hat early in the day and left it in for 6-8 hours (just went about my day), rinsed and washed with Just As I Am Coconut Co-wash... hair silk dark and SHINY!!! wow... used a light leave in and did a BnC (Braid Out and Curl) very shiny pretty. At night, generously applied whipped Shea Butter and Monoi Split End repairer and ""pineappled"". Hair fluffy, curly dark and shiny. love it!"
129083,2,"I didn't have any results with this particular product. I won't say it won't work for you, but it didn't for me. It actually made my eyes puff up more the first few times I used it. And as far as lightening the dark circles...again no change. So it means I have to stick to the camo under eye make-up which I would really like to get away from.Also, I HATE the way this product comes out of the bottle. There must be a better way."
142075,0,"The key to using this sunless tanning spray is to pump the canister full of air after only 4-5 seconds of spraying. As the air runs out, the spray becomes like rain instead of a micro-mist as advertised. I am very fair and did not come out looking orange but rather a natural tan - except in places where the spray turned into droplets."
151471,2,"I got this hair dryer in Fall of 2006. It worked great at first, but after about two and a half months of using it 2-3 times a week, the dryer lost most of its power. Instead of taking 5-10 minutes to dry my hair, it took at least 20, and even then my hair wasn't completely dried. Skip this hairdryer, find something better."
245344,0,"My overall experience I have with Neutrogena products is pretty good. This Oil-Free Lotion moistruzies my skin and especially I like ""pump"" type of the container since it's easy to use.But this moistruzier is nothing beyond average. It's a reasonable price, good for daily uses. and also this one doesn't have SPF, so persons like me who is looking for day cream without SPF, is good to go!But I do not recommend this product for those who has dry-skin type. As well, if you have an acne-prone skin, this will not going to imrpove your skin condition."
203814,0,"I ended my membership for these products, and for some reason, buying it through Amazon it did not seem to be the same quality. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was because I changed &#34;flavors&#34;. i used to use the Lavender one. I will buy a Lavender one and compare."

77501,0,"I rated this as ok. It's great to put on if you want a slight hint of pink, or use it over another polish to give it a sheen.I do not like that it doesn't last long. I go to work out in the pool at our local wellness center and find this polish does not hold up. Guess it's the bromine they use in this pool for disinfectant."
4826,2,This product is going in the trash. It is almost like a cold cream and doesn't even wash off a water based mascara. Partway through the day my face became so greasy it was affecting my vision - a greasy film transferring from my face to my eyes. Yuck!!
242125,2,"The bottle comes in an old, dirty and torn box with an blue ink stain on the bottom. The bottle seems to have been used - at least it is not full. The whole thing looked like it was coming from somebody's dirty closet. Never seen anything like that before. It is especially disturbing for heath and beauty items, I am sure they have violated a number of regulations. It is hard to believe that this was ordered from Amazon."
141332,0,The product is not as long lasting as what I had received previously from another product. The product I had used in the past is no longer available.
228480,0,"I really like this product, however it isn't worth the asking price from Mary Kay or Amazon. You can get as much hydration and same results from cheaper products. I've used better face wash products than the Timewise, that exfoliate and leave my skin a lot smoother and softer. The lotion is very useful, but I would recommend buying it by itself. I would suggest other products which in the end will be a lot cheaper and show more results. Also, ignore the comments and ratings left by angry consultants (typically they rated the item a 1). They come on here and purposely rate the products as low scores, because they lose business when someone buys on here instead of them. Even though when they sell Mary Kay, MK will give consultants free goody bags, discounts, and free products and not to mention they get paid for selling MK. I would highly suggest buying Mary Kay off Amazon. It's the same exact product, with the same exact quality. If you have problems with your amazon order, then request a refund or contact your seller. If the problem isn't resolved you can always write an Amazon A-Z guarantee form which has Amazon resolve the issue. I love Mary Kay products, and will always buy them on Amazon. I just didn't like the set, and it wasn't really worth it to me. I'll stick to buying the products I love separate for now on, but if you love this set, I guess it's worth it. But don't say I didn't tell ya so!"
37043,1,"Unlike other users, I had no problem with the location of the on/off switch. The curling iron heats up very quickly and the curls in my hair lasted all day. The only complaint I have is that the screws on both sides of the clamp are rather prominent, and my hair tends to get caught in it. Otherwise, this curling iron met my expectations!"
248407,1,"I LOVE pumpkin spice as a scent and am always on the lookout for great professional hair care that conditions and protects even processed hair that I can use on myself and my clients. I LOVE this product... I bought it because it is formulated for processed hair and smells so beautiful, the scent is amazing - very true to life pumpkin spice and ginger. So beautiful! I tried it and the results are (on my long JP straightened, coloured hair) soft, moisturized, bouncy and conditioned hair with a subtle pumpkin spice smell. When you first apply, the smell is very full bodied and strong, but as it dries, it becomes much softer. I love this product and suggest it to anyone who enjoys the scent of pumpkin spice anything and is looking for a great leave in conditioning product."
243835,0,"I get a lot of those under the skin painful cyst-like pimples, and I have blackheads as well. Sometimes the Persa-Gel helps with shrinkage over a few days, sometimes not at all. I do feel that once the acne has erupted, the persa-gel works faster.I had no idea why my bathroom towels were having bleach spots until I read the reviews here. Wish I had seen them sooner!I will try using the gel on blackheads and post-acne marks as recommended by a reviewer and see if it helps with that, but I have already ordered Buffering Lotion from Mario Badescu in the hopes that it will give better results. We shall see!"
234492,2,This thing was great. I used in the shower once every few days. This morning after having it for about a month it snapped in half. Very light pressure is used for this brush so I consider it a poorly designed or defective product. It was fairly expensive too. Choose wisely...not this brush. Goodluck looking for any satisfaction either.
69864,1,I mix it with my cheap conditioner and it can compare to any $20 bottle of conditioner.
239769,0,"I bought this product because the oils in this spray/scent were good for combating fleas, since I had tons and tons of flea bites all over my body and didn't want anymore! But I don't know if it actually helped but what did happen is that this oil (any body oil) makes me itch and the scent of Avon Skin So Soft is really overpowering! Even I'D stay away from myself!"

213499,1,"The Nexxus VitaTress Biotin shampoo was given me 2 years ago by a friend - I have since re-ordered twice for myself and for family members as I have found it a real help with restoring strength and lustre to winter/dry hair. .....i.e., hair subjected to a hairdryer on a weekly, sometimes daily basis, when the indoors is low in humidity. Thanks Nexxus!"
19440,2,The price may be right but it doesn't work for me. I have olive tone skin color so maybe it works better on someone with fair skin. I find it to look thick and way to yellow.
204519,1,"Wildroot hair creme has been around for a long time. No greasy feel, no smelly hair, hair looks natural and stays in place without being stiff or gooey. It works, it's that simple. I hope they never go away or at least that I die before they do."
59255,0,"Disappointed with the film that Castile leaves on my stainless sink. Other than that, the product is as described. Scent is mild. While the label on the bottle is chalked full of interesting graffiti, nowhere does it give any dilution ratios. I found that very annoying. I had to look them up online."
67855,0,"I use this following the Aveda Madder Root shampoo, and while it does a good job locking in the color, it leaves my hair less than silky. Comb through and leave in for at least one minute to maximize color. I have taken to mixing it with another conditioner for best results."
114951,0,Not my favorite...I like Avon glimmer stick. Liner disappears during the day. The tiny bit of shadow (hidden in the middle) does not even show on my eyes.

72422,0,It's a nice scent. And so far I am a fan of all Madina soap products
65489,1,"This is the ultimate fragrance, I love it. It is subtle, clean, refreshing, sexy, feminine and very classy. I usually like a lot of Lavender, Rosemary, and Mint fragrances, so this is a nice vaca from them. I love and enjoy and hope you will too."
160833,0,"I was surprised when I saw the price & the other reviews convinced me, so I bought it. I was used to my old $100 straightener, so I guess I had more expectations, but overall, this product is pretty good. It gets the job done, but obviously not as good as a straightener that is more expensive. However, it works & I like it."
163141,1,"Great long lasting soap with a light, fresh scent. It is a good size bar that offers a high quality clean."
54782,1,"I was very pleased when I found this cologne before Christmas, and the price was excellant. Would like to see more from this seller of advertised fragrances."
142049,1,"These are very well made and sturdy enough for many uses. They are very roomy, even a little too roomy for my short hair but it is easy to twist the excess in the back and tuck it into the elastic.They are also great for covering left over food containers in place of plastic wrap."
187932,0,"The iron seems decent overall, but the black tip at the end is way too short and I keep burning my fingers and thumb when I go to grab it."

88549,1,"Thanks for the great price on a great product. I live in Houston, with the horrible heat & humidity, so I use this all the time. Received it quickly and intact. Will continue to order from you!"
64308,0,"Ordered this small one to keep in the half-bath for touch-ups. I am a ""one-perfume"" kind of woman, and this is my signature scent. I am not so pleased about the bottle--the little stopper does not stay in, and the bottle is so round it will roll right over (because of the large stopper making it top-heavy). The bottle rolled over and I spilled almost half of it in the seconds before I could grab it. So, not happy about the bottle, but live and learn and get the larger size next time. Same wonderful classic scent though!"
121147,0,It's a little light for my skin color and it's not long lasting. Feels nice on and doesn't dry your lips.

215519,0,"Really great clippers, unless you have any moles on your head. If so, prepare for a bloody mess. These are really great, however they do not adjust if you are using them without an attachment, so if you happen to be someone like myself who happens to have a few moles on my dome, beware."
218977,0,"I just wish I would have read a little more reviews before I bought it. I searched for ""organic mascara"" and this came up. The ingredients contain methylparaben and polyparaben. So I'll use it for a month then I'll toss it and do a more thorough search next time."
51019,0,"This is a very earthy smell of sandlewood and spice. I bought this for my husband because he used it in high school back in the 1970's. When my husband recieved his cologne he noticed that it was much weeker than what he remembered and the scent only lasts but one hour after application. My advise would be to save your money and buy something much more quality other than this product. We gave it three stars only because it is a nice scent but definitely not long lasting at all. By the way Houbigant is not longer a business, Dana I believe bought it and Dana is five and dime kind of products-I rest my case."
119558,0,"Just a bit on your cheekbones is all you need to add a healthy ""dewy"" glow/look...too much and it looks blotchy, unnatural, and makes your skin look dry (at least mine did)."
17802,2,THIS WAS PURCHASED IN ERROR. IT WAS VERY DEFINITELY OVERPRICED. THIS PRODUCT DID NOT HAVE A SCENT AND THE PRODUCT WAS ALMOST MAROON IN COLOR. NOT THE PALE YELLOW COLOR OF THE SHAMPOO I PURCHASED IN THE PAST. THE PRODUCT WAS OLD. . THE ITEM WAS RETURNED TO THE SELLER FOR CREDIT. .
76576,0,"Doesn't smell like Lavender but more of a combination of other things such as ""sage"" which has the most dominant-like aroma. I had to give this a rating of 3 because this bar feels nice and lathers up smooth, BUT I cant get past the awkward smell. I was just expecting to smell 'strictly' L.A.V.E.N.D.E.R and did not get that experience.I can inhale even the cheapest of anything that advertises Lavender and it smell like L.A.V.E.N.D.E.R this doesn't cut it for me. Nice packaging and fast delivery atleast I can say."
35299,0,"I have light brown hair with a few blonde highlights and I used the Lucky Copper color on it as per the bottle instructions, applying it to damp hair. Unfortunately, I think because the rinse is not very dark, I couldn't really tell any difference in color. I re-applied it to dry hair (on top of what I had already put on it) and pretty much soaked my hair with it. It gave a very subtle wash of color. Some things to note:1) I could only tell it was kind of redish at the roots and scalp, possibly because it stuck better to my scalp than it did to my hair, otherwise it slightly darkened my hair.2) It has some styling power! I let it air-dry and it had that ""crunchy"" feeling before brushed.3) I did not wear gloves, and it did not stain my hands, but it did get under my nails which was a pain to get rid of.4) It will wear off before washing. I now have a rusty color all over the sweater I wore today and whenever I run my hands through my hair, they end up orange and sticky.5) It may be related to the sheer amount of product I had to use, but it did end up with a horrible but faint smell kind of like chemicals/burnt flesh.6) I have hip-legnth hair and It took about 1/3 of the bottle to coat it all.Overall, I probably won't try to color all of my head again because it dosen't work so well and smells bad. I may just do my top layer of hair or give some streaks into it. It does not drastically change the color of the hair. I think I may try the chocolate brown next to see if that gives more of a change."
159288,0,"product is light, absorbs well, smells nice. not bad for the price, though it did make me break out a little bit. my skin is particularly sensitive, though."
38085,2,My sister recently spilled a bottle of this stuff that belonged to my dad. Now our house smells like a cheap hotel room. Wonderful.
108644,1,"I've actually worn this for longer than I care to admit, but nothing matches it. It's elegant, sophisticated & unmistakeably sexy."
139447,0,"Even though I had a deep waver from Vidal Sassoon I ordered this one because I liked the ""curling iron barrel style"" opposed to my other one which made my hair a little kinky. This one works a tiny bit better but not much. My hair still looks kind of kinky and I wish the waves looked a little looser and more natural, but the price was outstanding if you just wanted something to switch up your straight hair every once in awhile. It is quite time consuming and awkward to use also."
119228,2,"Within 4 days of first touching water, the wood at the base of the bristles showed fissures and cracks, and then began to turn black (mildew?). Clearly, this brush is not well-designed to cope with water, which is where the product is supposed to be used, unfortunately. It did not crack, but I did not use it long enough to get to that point. I could see how if it got much more warped, it would crack and you wouldn't be able to fit the removable brush head back onto the handle. Threw it away. I wonder if plastic brushes would do better. I would not recommend this product at all."
77347,1,This is the strongest hairspray I've ever used! It works great for up-dos but do not use if you plan on being able to still manage your hair because it will feel like glue. I like it because it worked well for weddings and formal events where i needed my hair to last all day but I can't use it when i curl my hair and leave it down. Smells good!
71119,0,"Growing up in the UK, I remember Olbas Oil as being powerfully strong - so much so that I was afraid to get it on my skin when my mum was using it to alleviate the effects of the common cold I usually developed every year. I purchased this sampler kit recently to see if I could get my hands on something like what I remember. The oils and inhalers have the same smell, but I feel like they are weaker in strength than what I had in my childhood. Perhaps I am simply romanticizing what I recall, but I do think these scents could be stronger - my sinuses need it to be!If anyone can recommend a stronger Olbas product, I'm all ears!"
53523,2,"I used this dryer and loved it for about 2 weeks then the heat went out on it. I brought it back and got a new one(the same kind) and now 6 months later it won't even turn on. I am done with these dryers, they keep breaking."
160129,0,Be been taking it for over 2 or 3 weeks & to be honest I don't really see much of a difference maybe since I forget to take it. It's really hard for me to remember to take it since you have to take it 3 times a day.
232173,0,"I used Aqua di Selva about 25 years ago and it was my ""go to"" fragrance after trying several other products such as Aqua di Parma, Boucheron and Bulgari to name a few. But when it was nearly impossible to find, I used Creed and some of the other brands. Recently I was elated to find it on Amazon.com and purchased it. My disappointment was, that even though the initial spray has a strong woodsy smell, there is a heavy undertone of alcohol. The fragrance lasts at best about three hours, under moderate activities in air conditioned environment. I believe that I received a genuine product and not a diluted fake that seem to permeate the internet. The price cannot be beat but quality control may be lacking. I will continue to occasionally use Aqua di Selva EDC, but it is no longer my main fragrance."

117681,0,"This dye is advertised as permanent hair color gel but when you get the package it actually says that it is semi permanent and it doesn't last more than a few weeks and fades greatly with each washing. Gone from the hair completely in less than 6 weeks. I only gave it a 3 star review because the color is true to what the picture shows. It just shouldn't be advertised as permanent when it is anything but and the packaging itself even says ""semi-permanent"". False advertising if you ask me."
51878,0,"I recently purchased this product and I love the color of the blush it is great. But the top to get in the product sucks. It is so hard to get the top off I almost regret getting it. The packaging is so important because I am a freelance makeup artist and I need to get in and out of my makeup with ease. This blush is very hard to get into, which slows me down. So, I love the color but hate the packaging."
103783,0,"I really liked how it looked and ordered it as a gift for my friend, but it turned out, that the round sign (logo) where there should be written - Daniel, is empty. There is no DANIEL written on any part of the bag. The round sign is absolutely empty. Does it mean, that I received not genuine product? As it was the gift, for me it was important not to have deffective product."
10592,2,"The overwhelming number of customer reviews for this product was positive, which led to my confidence purchase.I, however, personally find this product to be a little too oily. I have naturally wavy, fine, dry hair that needs to be straightened everyday.When I put this product on (following exactly what the instructions said), I found my hair somewhat shiny in appearance. However, the product also kept the strands of my hair in somewhat of a chunky fashion, and my hair wasn't blowing naturally in the wind. And every time I touched my hair throughout the day, there was the unpleasant oily feeling lingering on my fingers that I had to wash off. The next day when I started washing my hair, I noticed that one round of shampooing was far from enough to get all the product out of my hair."
55308,0,The effect wasn't as effective as I expected. Not sure if time does the trick of curing.
57087,1,"Overall, I found Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer to be a pretty good moisturizer. In fact, it may have over-moisturized in certain areas. Therefore, I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin over the majority of their face. The product did make my face feel smoother. I WOULD recommend this to family and friends."
137413,0,I fell in love with this color when I saw it and I was so excited to try it. I absolutely love the color but I agree with the people who said that it goes on too thinly. It also has no gloss or shine to it whatsoever and imperfections are so visible! I am tempted to mix some clear sparkle polish into it or something to thicken it up and make it better. Not the best polish by China Glaze.
50928,2,"I used an earlier model for years with no problems. The rollers finally disentigrated and as I could get new rollers with the new model almost as cheaply as just buying the rollers separately, I bought the new one. It was great at first. Smaller, faster. But after less than 3 months....it quit! No warning signs, just stopped. I drug out my old model and fired it up. I travel some so I'm glad it didn't give out on a trip. Couldn't recommend it."
104619,0,"I love this brush. It helps my hand washing to be really clean. I always wash my hands when I put on and take off my contact lenses, but I sometimes get eye infection. This brush really make sure that my hands are really clean. The bristle feel nice on the hands and does its job."
20975,2,I did not like the product. Givenchy had a great product called Xeryus. Then they changed the formula and it was terrible!
93072,1,"I was skeptical at first but orderd it anyways. When I first rubbed the cream on my stomach i could feel a tightness, and it does really work. I would definately buy this product again."
227204,1,"My husband and I thought that this scent was gone forever; however, a little research and - who would have guessed it - our favorite MEMBERS ONLY scent was for sale on Amazon! We are very satisfied with this purchase. A little pricey, but well worth it to us."
95283,0,These curlers do heat quickly...bonus! The problem is that they will not hold a tight curl once put in your hair. I believe the plastic clips that the set comes with just arent tight enough to hold the curler in place.
149743,0,I've been using this lotion for little over a month now and it worked wonders for my dry skin. The firming part did not work for me at all and i'm almost done with the bottle. It has a very light scent its keeps my skin so soft and smooth. As for the firming i've been using another cream by nourish called skin tight its really good. Hopes this helps

1395,1,First read about this product when a magazine was interviewing Sandra Bullock. Asked what her secret to her glowing radiant look. This was the product that she uses to achieve the spectacular appearance. I really like the light feel and coverage. Always get compliments of how healthy my skin looks.

116294,0,"The Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave In Cream does not make my hair silky. My hair only take to it sometimes.The days I wash my hair, the leave in cream makes my hair frizzy and dry. If I use it any other time my hair is fine, but its no better than any other leave in."
112247,2,"What I am looking for in a sunscreen: safe/nontoxic, unscented, and effective. This sunscreen meets the criteria for safety (according to the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database), and is unscented. The problem I have with it is that it is quite oily and causes my face to sweat. Once I'm out in the sun, I feel like I've been basted. The instructions say to reapply after perspiring, which would mean (in my case, anyway) reapplying almost continuously. This really negates any benefits from the sunscreen! Will continue to search for a sunscreen that is equally nontoxic, but not as oily."
151341,0,"I bought this product because ""dragon's blood"" was on the dr Oz show and recommended. The only place on the bottle that mentions Dragon's blood is hand written on the label in red pen. So i'm not sure that it was the product that I really wanted. The lotion is nice enough."

96712,0,"This eye patch is as advertised. I have trouble with it though. I can still see with my bad eye, but it is not lined with my other eye making me see double. I bought this so I would have to hold one eye shut all the time. But since I still have vision in that eye, and even though it is black what I see, it still makes my vision not as good as when I just close that eye. Not the products fault, but fault with my vision."

194349,0,"I'm all about natural products, but something about citric acid doesn't agree with my sensitive skin. Or maybe product isn't PH balanced. Either way, if you have sensitive, dry to normal skin, I would suggest using a different product. I couldn't wash my face every day with this, but rather every two days, only using water and moisturizing in between. It was too harsh for me to use everyday."
166788,0,"Pros: Tan is very natural looking. Does not look orange, rather a nice brown color. As far as rubbing off it does a little bit after it dries but no more so than other self tanners. I would say its one of the better ones when it comes to this issue.Cons: It STINKS! Color didn't show up until 2 applications, ( put it on later shower that day, and the next day applied again). After the 2 nd application I would reapply like every three - four days.You must use the gloves. If it weren't for the smell I would rate five stars."
210713,1,I wore this to the office and Bob A Buey told me it smelled a little strong. But if you're like me and all about meetin girls and meetin guys you'll love this fragrance.
199035,0,"My wife was asking for an expensive hair straigtener because the cheap one she purchased seems to stop working, or doesn't work as well after a year.So I ordered this Farouk CHI hair straigtener, and when it arrived, it was in a very cheap package. The handles was made of real cheap recycle plastic, which my wife complains to me about it because I ordered it (my wife use to work in the plastic injection mold industry, so she always checks out the quality of the mold and plastic).This hair straigtener is not worth $100, it looks more like a $20-$30 product. The Revelon, Conair, etc.. for $20-30 looks more expensive then this ""professional"" straigthener. As far as how it function, my wife decided not to try it and I returned it back to Amazon. She choose to go to a store where she can look and feel the product before buying it.My advice is, if you know exactly what you're getting, order it from Amazon. Otherwise, if you have no idea how it feels or looks, I would check it out in the stores first. Good luck."
191983,0,"Perhaps I was expecting a small miracle - that my short, thin eyelashes would become long, thick, smooth and luxurious after using this along with mascara. That didn't happen. It add a little thickness, and maybe the conditioning is helpful. I will continue to use and see if there is improvement."
244229,1,"This product is amazing! A small amount goes a long way and it makes my skin feel heavenly. I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps me skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin. It does improve the ""look"" of my skin but can't say much about the long term benefits as I haven't used it that long. I am in my early 50's and haven't always taken good care of my skin, especially protecting it from the sun. I also use their skin lightener and the two products working together are making a positive difference. I would recommend."
154367,0,"I have always loved these towels for camping and then came along children and they are great to take to the beach, especially when you are hiking there and want to lighten your load. However, my children ages 2 and 6, complain these are too small. I would say they are great to dry off with but certainly not to wrap up in. I would go ahead and buy the x-lrg size for all your family members."
235376,1,"I've been a fan of Focus 21 since the 80's...their spray-on moisturizer is the best light moisturizer I've EVER found. The Jojoba shampoo was a lot thicker than I expected (I just diluted it, more for my money, right?) and smelled more like baby shampoo than jojoba, but it was really gentle and didn't strip my hair. I'd buy it before going to the store, but I prefer my SeaPlasma smell best."
236612,0,"The shipping of the product was fine. The product itself is a ""3"" for me. I think my lashes are softer, but not lengthy. I have been using this for one month."
183726,0,"It was heavy, which I can adjust to, however the nozzle was too small. I didn't feel like I was ever going to finish drying my hair! So this is why I returned it. I gave it 3 stars b/c it is probably a good hair dryer, but I only used it once."
129398,1,"If you have dry skin or live in a dry environment, this is the product for you. I have sensitive skin and I tried multiple different cr&egrave;mes from expensive department store bought to reasonably priced drug store bought and I now swear by Nivea Body Renewal Night Cr&egrave;me. I use it daytime and nighttime and it leaves the skin soft and moist. The cr&egrave;me is not creasy or heavy and it gets absorbed very fast especially if you apply it while the skin is still dump right after a shower. I even converted my husband who hates to use lotion in general to start using and now he does leave the house without it. Highly recommend-try it at least once before you dismiss it. But it's hard to find in drug stores; you can find the lotion version but not the cr&egrave;me (not sure why). BTW the lotion version is not as good. I hope Nivea does not discontinue the cr&egrave;me!!!!"
225879,2,I purchased this not knowing how it smelled. I liked the smell from the bottle and when it's first sprayed but the fragrance was gone within minutes and never could even get a hint of it throughout the day.
165958,0,While I was waiting to get this product me (being impatient) went out and bought a knock off brand from a local store. I'd have to say so far the knock off brand worked better than this. I did not feel the face tightening effect other viewers had described with this product (though i did with the store bought brand) and this has caused me to break out in the most unpleasent of places on my face. Weird places like in between my eyes and eyebrows and forehead. Perhaps I will try again in the future but I am dissapointed in this product right now.
68068,1,I absolutely love this perfume. It smells great but the only negative thing that I can say is that it doesn't last as long as I would expect from an EDP. It lasts maybe 1-2hrs at most.
205515,0,"Now that I have read the reviewer that said the scent doesn't last I have to say that I agree!!! Just got to work and I can't smell it. I think I'll have to get the lotion and layer it. But the fragrance is worth the name DELICIOUS!! You will not be dissapointed. I usually go for florals and this scent is perfect for me. One more thing, I find it awkward to hold the round apple shape in my hand and spray from the top. Is that just me???"
47656,1,"The product arrived very quickly and I must say after using just two vials my hair has become stronger and the dryness has totally gone. My hair has totally transformed it's easy to comb it has less breakage and now it has a natural shine. I recommend this product to anyone, I only use the best in my hair and the results speak for it's self."
179044,0,Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty. Basically anything china glaze is pretty awesome.
7670,0,I had this sent to someone who has not let me know if it arrived. I am assuming it did and that it is fine but I have no way of honestly reviewing. I gave a review saying the same thing before but I didn't punch in any stars because nothing applies in my situation. This time I gave the middle number of stars so that it will be done and I won't get asked again to review.
185212,0,"It doesn't keep hair smoother or shinier any more than a regular curling iron. It heats up quickly. My hair doesn't glide through very well, and often gets caught in the iron."
55338,1,"I'm now in my late 20's and I never really grew out of acne. I still get pimples, which usually start as sore, red spots. Zeno has worked for me when I have put it on the sore, red spots or very early pimples and within a treatment or two, the zit is gone, usually within a day or two. Usually, the zit would linger for a week or more and get worse, sometimes leaving a little scar in it's place. This doesn't work well on mature zits though, which is fine because that's not what it's intended for and from experience I can testify that it is true, as the manufacturer states, that if you use the Zeno on a big zit and/or one that has already become a pustule it will make it worse and not better.The heat is not really an issue. It's a shock when you initially put the device on a sore spot, the heat amplified by the sensitivity of the inflamed skin, but your skin and the device adjust. It is not hot enough to damage the skin and any redness it leaves behind fades quickly.An experience I had with the Zeno sometimes was when a zit wouldn't disappear, but rather accelerate in duration, meaning it would quickly, perhaps overnight after a pre-bedtime treatment, turn into a mature pustule and then pop and dissolve by the morning of the next day. The good news is that those zits didn't become big and didn't scar when they healed.I would recommend this product to people who have moderate acne and are sensitive to topical products because I have fair, sensitive skin and can't use benzoyl peroxide and other harsh chemicals on my face. You put it on the zit for a couple of minutes and you're done. While this doesn't heal acne completely, it does prevent skin from becoming worse from drying out and scarring."
50996,0,"The overall quality is very good and the system performs well.The steam is very gentle to the hair and forms long lasting curls.The draw backs are the sponge rollers and the clamps. While the rollers may work well for long or curly hair they don't work so well for medium or short straight hair. The sponge rollers do not grasp hair and it is almost impossible to coax the hair to wrap around roller. I finally resorted to purchasing velcro rollers, removing the velcro and hot glueing it around the Carusso sponge roller. The other problem is the clamp which holds the roller in place. It leaves a dent in the hair which has to be removed with a curling brush and blow dryer. I would give this product an A+ if the rollers and clamps were better designed but as is I give it a C."
133106,1,"I have dry scalp and tea tree oil shampoo is the only shampoo that helps that. Also, this shampoo is not made with toxic ingredients and is one of the few shampoos that do not affect my daughters chemical sensitivity issues. I also use the matching conditioner."
81604,2,I spray this on my hair as soon as I am done styling. It's smell last about a total of :30 seconds. It's a total waste. You are better off spraying your perfume on your hair instead. You might get drying alcohol doing it that way but that's apparently the only way to get the fragrance to last on your hair.
122021,0,"I like the product because it's natural and my household is trying like mad to get away from chemicals. However, I found like I have to use it beyond liberally for it to work for any period of time. I have let my body adjust to natural products, but I'm still having to take the time for a liberal application. The other thing I don't like about it, and this is probably because I'm clumsy, but it gets very slippery and I tend to drop it. Once I drop it and it cracks or splits apart, there are so many rough edges I end up cutting myself. On the other hand, it does work and the product itself lasts for quite a long time."
23318,0,"I got the doux soap in Jasmine scent .It had great smell , but it isn't long lasting. The size and shape of the bar is not user friendly.And it is pretty drying , not moisturizing at all.A little pricy for just the smell."
55623,0,"Although it is a good product, I did not find it worked on my hair as well as I expected."
108592,1,delivered as expected...wish it had a smaller nozzle to deliver more controled amount of product into palm of your hand.
96568,1,It is a shame that this product cannot be purched in stores anymore .I know when I find things that can be used by 3 or 4 females of my family the product becumes hard to get. I would leke to see Bill Blass back in the market place.
67427,0,The scent is alright just like every other eau de toilette. It's very light so it's hard for others to even smell it. I thought it would be unique and different according to the description of other customers. Perhaps it depends on your type. I'd prefer something else over Reaction.
141844,1,Nutraderm Therapeutic Lotion really and truly works! I've been using the lotion for a week and my badly chapped hands are healed. The lotion does just what it claims. I highly recommend Nutraderm for anyone who has sensitive skin. I'll certainly be using it. It surely has been a godsend. No other product has worked so well!
105452,2,"I love this fragrance, and have had a hard time finding it anymore as Ralph Lauren stopped distributing it in stores. I was happy with the price point, and excited that after a few years I was able to get my signature scent back; I am disappointed that every time I spray the perfume leaks out the sides of the top and gets all over my hand, making it difficult to apply."
242971,1,"I LOVE Purity, its the best cleanser ever. It will literally melt off all your makeup without making the skin too dry. I wear a lot of water proof eyeliners and this stuff works great on that. I use it as my everyday cleanser even with no makeup on. Its just great and doesn't strip the skin. Its a true clean. The price Amazon has for subsribe and save is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!! On a popular beauty site it was 32 bucks for this same size plus shipping. At the time of this review I paid about 27.50 here on Amazon with free shipping. A WAY better deal for something I use all the time. Its great, you won't regret buying it."
56395,2,"I usually like Neutrogena products, but this one irritates my eyes for some reason. I prefer Oil of Olay for sensitive skin with spf 15."
188687,0,"While the wash itself seems to work very well, I have to knock stars for the consistency and the bottle. The bottle is aluminum and I dropped it once in the shower to find it put a gash in the tub! Be careful, if it falls spout facing down, it can cause some damage.Someone previously mentioned the gelatinous texture and they are dead on. When the stuff is not heated up, it is very solid stuff and takes nearly a minute for anything to start oozing out of the bottle. To get the stuff to come out a little better, I now put the bottle on the shower floor so the water can heat up the bottle to get the stuff to flow out a little better."
66030,0,"Well, I had bought the maxiglide after I viewed the infomercial for it at my local beauty supply store. It was awesome, it was great, and I loved it.- But after a while, the plates started to melt to the point where it would not close properly. I mean the plates actually melted almost all the way around the plate where it became sealed to the actual straightner and could not be removed or closed properly. I could not believe it. Maybe I got a defected one, I had used it everyday for about 4 months and this happened."
54188,0,I curled my hair w/o damaging it but the pins to hold it up dont work

92532,1,My daughter bought Narcisse for me years ago.. I could not afford it back then and now it is even better with Amazon.. Thank you and many love the smell.. nice and soft and floral..buying one for my friend as she keeps asking me where I got it... nice Christmas gift too...
111410,1,I recently used my boyfriend's Hydroplane Shave Cream and let me say . . . my legs have never been smoother or silkier. With summer coming up I can't wait to show off my glorious gams.
57718,2,"I didn't like this cream at all. It has a strong chemical odor and it stung my face when I used it. I thought the burning feeling would go away after a few days but it didn't. I didn't notice any improvement with my skin at all. However, the cream comes packed in a pretty blue jar, but that was the only thing I liked about it."
162306,1,"I read reviews all the time but never write any, but now I've decided to write because I appreciate the helpful reviews others have written that helped steer me in the right direction, so I want to give back and help others if I can. I've tried many products and for the most part have seen no difference in my skin. This includes many highly reviewed products. But this, along with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash (which I also buy for a great price on Amazon too) are the only two things I can remember using that made a noticeable difference in my skin.So you know, I have rosacea, and had shiny, red, sometimes flushed and burning cheeks. I tried many things until I finally settled on this regimen and it has improved my skin greatly. It has more of a matte look instead of that shiny, red irritated look. I use the clarisonic Mia with the DELICATE brush. I ran out of it once and used the gentle brush that came with the Mia and saw and felt a definite difference. It was too rough on my skin and left it red and abused feeling. I use it with the Neutrogena product I mentioned in the first paragraph. (I was using the Neutrogena grapefruit wash before and that was NOT good. Left me very red.) Then I use this moisturizer. I used to use the same one in the daytime version, but that one would go on streaky and then crumble when I tried to wipe away the streaks. Also it looked kinda shiny and I didn't like the way my skin looked with it on. The night version has none of those problems. I wear it day or night and when I put it on in bed without a mirror, if I get up to go the bathroom or something, when I look in the mirror I see no streaks. That was not the case with the daytime version which I used to use at night. I woke up in the morning with all kinds of crazy streaks. Also, I love the smell and feel of it while it's going on. It feels a little cool which is just what my rosacea skin needs. You might not notice the cool feeling, but if you have rosacea then you definitely appreciate a cream that's cool rather than warm when going on. Also, it's hard to explain, but it makes my skin look really nice and glowing-like. Other reviewers have probably explained it better than me and all I can say is it's true!One more thing that I feel I should mention, though with many reservations and ""buts"", is the Tanda Luxe. I bought one around the same time I adopted this skin care routine. I think it has also made a difference in my skin as far as the shinyness from rosacea but it also leaves my skin pleasantly flushed when I finish using it which might not be a good thing for Rosacea, but I'm unsure. Another reservation I have in recommending this is that all the reviews that complain about its battery are completely true. I have to charge it after every two times I use it. And lately it's gotten even worse.Those of you reading this that have rosacea, you should know that the products I use have ingredients that are not recommended for people with rosacea, but it works for me and my moderate rosacea. It might not work for you, and I guess we all have to find what works for us and our type of rosacea. I hope I've been helpful and wish you all the best!"
242251,1,"I have normal hair, but its dry. I knew buying it that I shouldn't expect it to be a salon treatment- so I think my expectations were reasonable. It was great and it works like a charm on relatively normal hair.My coworkers noticed it as well. Big difference from before, lot of shine. I wash my hair everyday out of habit and i blow dry, flat iron. My hair is straight with a bit of wave. I recommend this to just about anyone. I think it is a great product to use instead of expensive morrocan oil."
23390,2,"Though the shipping was fast I opened the package only to find a completely different kind of hair gel. Instead of my Power Control Style Gel, Mega Hold...I got Extreme Style, Ultimate Hold Power Gel. They could be the same but the packaging design is completely different..."
45868,2,"After doing a test on Guerlain's website which enables you to find out which fragrance suits you the best, Mitsouko turned out to be the site's recommendation. Since it is not available where I live (Uruguay), I bought it online. No chance to test it before. I had read wonderful reviews, and I dreamt of it...until I got it. Undoubtedly, a fragrance is a personal thing. Mitsouko has all the charme, the mystique and the history that appeals on me, but it doesn't work on me!When sprayed, it smells horribly, something urine-like, sweet , persistent and absolutely displeasing. I don't regret the purchase, because I had no other option to test it, but I won't buy it again!!!"
146286,0,"this iron is for 120V and in my contry ,there is 22OV... WHAT CAN I DO?? Will it burn out if I turn it on????"
101092,2,"I have used British Sterling cologne for many years. This is not the real thing. It is a thinned out, cheap rip-off of a very good product. There is a label underneath the bottle stating it is ""made in China with Fragrance oil made in USA"". Even the cap came apart after opening it a few times."
236404,1,"I think this product is little expensive than the others,But I am really satisfied for quality.When I remove this kind of bling bling nail color, it's very hard to remove sticked glitters on my nail.My first purchasing this was on HSN.I became a big fan of this brand and still want to order more colors."
74579,0,"I purchased a 3-piece set of Demeter's fragrance which contained, Fresh Ginger, Ginseng Root, and Green Tea. Green Tea was the worst of the 3 scents, because something in it gave me a terrible headache: Trashed it. Ginseng Root has a somewhat musty, incense? smell to it: Not too bad, but I am not sure about this one. Fresh Ginger is the best of the 3 scents. Fresh Ginger has an earthy, woody, and somewhat mysterious note to it and it does NOT give me a headache....in fact, as I write this comment, I sprayed Fresh Ginger on my wrist, and LOVE the scent. It is one of the best fragrances that I have tried; however, I am not sure that it is going to be my signature scent, because whenever I wear it away from home, most people sniff at me, and noone asks me about the fragrance; so, I guess (some?) they don't particularly care for it. I think that I will try Fresh Laundry or Pure Soap next, because many people seem to give very good reviews about these fragrances: particularly Fresh Laundry.I am trying to find THEEE fragrance (or two), but I am somewhat cautious about many fragrances, because they usually give me a headache. Strangely, I thought that musk was the culprit, but I am not certain about this as I have white musk (albeit an old bottle of about 10 years which may have weakened the scent?) by The Body Shop and I tested it by spritzing on my wrist and smelled it multiple times to see what affect (if any) the musk would have towards my sinus area. Well, after a few hours of intermittent wrist-smelling, I finally had a headache. I alternatively, did this without smelling my wrist, and noticed that I had no headache. So, I guess spraying on the wrist, and probably not near the nose (neck, ears, hair) is my best bet, unless it is not just musk which gives me a headache."
208058,1,"I have been using this product for 6 months. On a daily basis I can see the difference. When I do not use the product, there is a drastic appearance under my eyes. The only downfall is that it is difficult not to apply on a daily basis, because of the drastic difference."
58767,2,Ordinarily I like L'oreal hair color but the box of hair color sent to me looked like it had been on their storage shelf for many years and was outdated as far as coverage for grey hair. Shirley
143473,0,"I have really long eyelashes so I was expecting amazing results after reading the reviews. I just use a clear mascara so that may have been the problem as it has less substance than a colored mascara. The price is right though, if you need to experiment."
185076,0,"This is a great little device. It works as advertised. I have only used it twice so far, but it does in fact keep my hair trim and even. I do warn you though that this device is for very short hair. The longest it can be set to is 1 inch so if you are looking for a longer cut then that, this is not the device for you. If you are looking for 1 inch or less then this is an easy way to trim without making as much of a mess as a normal trimmer would make."
133889,0,"The good thing about this product is that the color is a very pretty bright light turquoise blue. It goes really good in-between layers of black and green. (This is what I used it for, it looked very nice!)Now there are a few bad things about this product also. The color only lasted me maybe 3-5 washes and I had the color cream stay on my hair for an extra 10-20 minutes (as my hair takes forever to take color.) And I even added a low heat!It really is a beautiful color, just doesn't stay in long enough for a busy teen."
180567,1,"I only use Angel for a scent, now referred to as my ""signature"". It's feminine without being flowerey. Very subtle...fabulous."
180258,0,"Being a guy I'm NOT that fussy about soap, and this was a great price. Would just like to note, despite what another review said I find the smell a bit unpleasant. Also, I suppose it's the Vaseline, but the soap is EXTREMELY slippery when wet. VERY hard to keep a hold of. Neither issue is a deal breaker for me, but because of the 'slippery issue' it may not be the best choice for children or senior citizens."
197284,0,"Ok so i am obsessed with my hair, and I am one to tell you the truth. I needed a new flat iron so I bought a ""chi"" from amazon.com. After a few uses it completely blew out, so I decided to see where I could get a new one from besides amazon, and low and behold the chis up here are fake!!!...Original chis are shiny and do not have the logo printed on top, so yes I wasted my money...however now I have a new and real one and am quite satisfied!"
145545,1,i bought this polish because i thought it would be a nice change from cajun shrimp (that i use all the time). it is so close that most people would not be able to tell the difference.

221445,0,"I have natural red hair and wanted something non-permanent to give it a little vavavoom. Like many red heads, I have naturally lighter bits closer to strawberry blonde where the sun hits it while I have much darker red and auburn everywhere else. This conditioner colored my lighter bits a strange pinkish-red. I've started avoiding those areas and apply now mostly towards the back. My hair is very bright now... but it does look a little bit like a dye job."
133308,0,This eyeliner does stay on pretty good at first but does flake off during the day. The liner brush it comes with is hard to controll. I actually use a brush I had from another liquid eyeliner that works much better. This product is good but not perfect.
190171,2,"I always pay attention and try to be very carefull about products review before buying them over the internet. After reading all the good comments and positive feedbacks about the Hanae Mori i was excited about it, but unfornetlly it didnt go like that. The perfume turned out to be a Complete waste of money, the smell is horrible ; it actually smells like dirt combined with sweat, The smells doesnt even last.... If you plan on buying this tryit out first before wasting your money...."
128386,2,"I used to use another product, it has good effect on control the size.I only had on elbow. I bought this product because it has good review.I used it three times a day, the skin surface become flat.However, just the time I think it's good enough, it become worse. The infected area are twice bigger now.I guess you have to keep using this product, which makes me feel not safe."
123031,2,"I'm disappointed to say that this product didn't cover any of my gray hairs. There is no change in my hair color whatsoever. I used the whole bottle and left it on for 40 minutes. (My original hair is brown, but I followed the instructions for white, hoping to cover my ""gray"" hairs, which are actually more like silver than white.)I've tried other hennas before, and they didn't affect my gray hairs either. I thought that maybe I just wasn't doing a good enough job with the hard-to-use powdered and solid hennas. I thought that maybe this easy-to-use cream would produce some results for me. But I think I'm about ready to give up on henna; I think that maybe there is just something about my hair that henna refuses to stick to.On the positive side, the product was easy to apply and rinse off, didn't irritate my scalp and didn't smell too bad. So it could be a perfect non-toxic product for someone whose hair it would actually stick to."
121753,2,I have a brush just like this one that I really like but it only cost $5.00. $120?! - is that a mistake?
213314,0,"Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer."
116781,2,"this curling iron i guess is pretty much worth the money, i have fine, very thin hair which is hard to curl regardless, but this curling iron literally didnt do anything to my hair. the size is perfect!! but my curls fall out very fast or dont even curl at all. gets hot, but not hot enough!"
220747,2,1. Too sweet. Felt like I was spraying sugar on me.2. Fragrance did not last even for 3 hours even with 4-5 sprays. And its a EDP for gods sake!
142606,0,"I've previously purchased a more expensive brand of Shea butter, but thought I would try this brand to save money. Now I know why I paid a little more. The texture of this Shea butter is mealy--which took me off guard. Once I ""massaged"" it in my hands a while, it took on a more familiar texture. I'm still deciding if the cost savings is worth the unfamiliar texture."
24317,1,This is the best and most perfect Travel (Accessories) bag on earth.If you're used to packing all your personal care/personal hygiene items in zip lock bags for travel and are tired of doing so...you should look into getting this bag.I own this item in pink (it was a gift) and it is absolutely wonderful.I travel quite often and find that I can fit all my personal items (make up/personal toiletries/medicine) all in this bag...and don't have to shuffle through anything to find what I need. The bag has so much room. No more Zip Lock bags for me...Everything can be seen clearly and have its own storage area. No more worrying about Shampoo explosions in your suit case or in the zip lock bag or in your personal care bags... no more worrying about items moving around in the zip lock bags when traveling. Everything stays put.This bag is perfect for business travelers and for families/teens. It is wonderful to have everything right at your fingertips when it comes to organizing your personal items for travel. This bag definitely beats all the other Travel Make-Up personal accessories bags. No need to put everything into separate zip lock bags anymore.If/when my bag falls apart I am definitely getting another bag like this again.
144968,2,Didn't smell like the Cachet I've loved over the years. I'll purchase elsewhere next time to see if I'm right.
110874,1,"I stumbled upon this foutain of youth in a bottle while working in a health food store. All Zia products are incredible but I especially enjoy the seaweed lift serum because of the natural glow and beauty enhancing it provides. I could see a difference the moment I put it on- the directions say to apply after cleansing, when face is damp. My first time using it I applied the serum without damping, and/ or adding a moisturizer on top of it. The serum immediately made a difference, and other people noticed; they mentioned my face looked really good.."
226899,1,Is very good. it smells very nice and soft. In my case i like because is accurate for the morning
84372,2,"I have MILDLY sensitive skin..at least I did before I tried the 3 step program which included the mild soap and this moisturizer.All seemed well with world for about a week...then all heck broke loose. I broke out in welts on my chin and nose....painful, dry and burning. I know it was due to the soap and toner.The lady at the Clinique counter ""convinced"" me that I needed to stick with the soap and switched me to the mild toner.The issue just compounded.The soap is WAY too drying. This is the gimmick: you use the soap which supposedly ""loosens the glue that holds dead skin cells to your face"".. HUH?? Then you use their toner (may as well use straight Vodka) to wipe away the loose cells. Then, after your face is totally in shock, you slap on moisturizer than never actually sinks into your skin; it just settles on top, leaving a waxy feel and shine. I may as well have taken a candle and rubbed it on my face! I warned everyone not to light a match near me; I may go up in flames from the alcohol or melt from the waxy buildup.So I stopped using it all.....went to the doctor who INSISTED I use them again. So I did, this time getting the liquid version of this soap.Within 2 days, I had a million itchy bumps on my forehead and the welts began to appear again. I also had dry itchy eyes. I ended up returning it all and switching to Perscriptives Comfort line. Now I TRUELY have sensitive skin because of these ""allergy tested, dermatologist recommended"" products.Look at the ingredients...for one thing, Clinique does not list them online and are very reluctant to give out when you call....and I noticed that EVERY time I bought the products at Nordstroms, the Clinique ladies CONVENIENTLY put their receipt-free return label RIGHT OVER THE INGREDIENTS on the packaging!Most people I know either never had good luck with the 3 step regime, or did at first, but not over time."
366,0,"This could be a really good shampoo...but where is it written that shampoo must smell like a piece of candy? A lot of the ""good"" shampoos I've tried smelled like a candy bar..this one smells like a sour apple jaw breaker. YUCK!It's really a shame. This shampoo leaves your hair conditioned and clean. If it weren't for the aroma I'd give it five stars. But then I may not be a member of their target demographic. So if you prefer wine to a good craft beer, don't eat red meat, and are in touch with your feminine side, this may be the shampoo for you!"
7734,2,"I actually tested the smell of CK Eternity for men EDT at Macy's and I liked it. I ordered it from Amazon, since it was way cheaper than in Macy's. But to my disappointment, and as many others have already pointed out, the smell of the bottle that I received didn't match the original (It smells like cheap soap water with a citrus tinge!).This is second time such a thing happened (two out of two). The last time it happened was like two years ago, and I thought I would give Amazon another chance -- I thought the products sold by Amazon LLC (I didn't remember who was the seller last time around) will be original and fresh. But not so!!!Either the products is fake, or is not fresh -- but definitely it didn't smell like the one I tested at Macy's.I strongly advise anyone thinking of buying this, DON'T buy it from Amazon. Bye it from a retailer.**YOU CAN'T RETURN** this product to Amazon. My money has gone straight to the garbage.However, like I said, the original CK Eternity for men EDT is a good product, just not the one I got from Amazon."
105070,0,"Doesn't work as well as Jergens naturally smooth did. It takes longer to rub in (although it's not impossible) and sometimes can leave a white residue. I usually use it on the days I'm wearing pants or at night if I put it on my legs. It has an off smell. Overall though, the product seems to work as described."
19322,0,"I have used Bare Minerals for about 8 years and I have to say, it's time to give it up. I first purchased this foundation when I was 24. I was in love! It has good coverage (sheer to full depending on application) and good lasting power (has lasted at the gym and club). My complexion was flawless! It was really quick and easy to apply, although it was a little messy with the sifter and lid, etc. The reason I have decided to abandon it after so many years is because as I have aged, I have acquired a few fine lines, and BE foundation emphasizes this. It is also pretty poor at covering dark circles (again, it sinks into fine lines when you apply enough and doesn't cover if you apply too little). I seriously started thinking about switching when fine lines would show up only when I was wearing this foundation. My skin has always been dry but now I feel I need a more moisturizing foundation to prevent dullness. The shimmer in the BE foundation was increasingly starting to look ashy or chalky more frequently than radiant. It might sound silly, but I almost feel I'm ending a meaningful relationship. We were so good together for so many years, but it just isn't working anymore. I am sorry to have to move on."
16229,0,"The bubbles in this bubble bath were quite adequate. They were thick and long lasting. The scent was appealing. However, I would've preferred the scent to be stronger especially after being poured into the tub. It smelled very nicely in the bottle, but was undetectable in the bath."
47938,0,"All these dry shampoos seem to do a good job of giving you a quick pick up for your hair when you don't have time to wash and they all give volume just by the nature of the product. But, they all also have way too much fragrance and none of them really pleasant. I end up washing my hair anyway because i don't want to go anywhere smelling like I dumped cheap body powder in my hair."
206060,0,"This isnt too bad but I dont think its practical and it goes on uneven until you learn how to apply it I guess. I have a 4 year very old can and just tried it again today.I do remember though when i first tried this 4 years ago just on my upper torso and abs (this stuff makes my abs show better), I made the mistake of wearing a white dress shirt the next day. When I removed my shirt that night after work, I noticed it was colored all over on the inside. The shirt needed serious bleeching to remove the color.You will also notice it comes off on white sheets. Also sweat will make this stuff run a bit, even 2 days later. I might try buying a 3 pack and I will see what those results are. Maybe they modified the forumula a bit. These day you can get a 3 pack for like $11. They should give you a 5 pack for that price though"
217073,0,"Loofas never really did it for me, but for as long as I can remember ,I've been passively looking for a decent back scrubber. I have broad shoulders and it seems impossible to get that spot in the middle of my back and below my shoulder blades. Being a little fed up I ordered this one and the aquis and this one had slightly better than usual results. The Aquis Backscrubber had more contact, more abrasive, longer. If you like loofas this is probably a good one for you."
221781,0,This milk based soap is great for the constant hand washing that goes on in the kitchen. It keeps my hands soft and silky.
204581,1,"Ferrari Black 5/5, Notre Dame De Paris Perfumes 5/5, Shipping 5/5 Amazing prices 5/5 overall my opinion is its a really good cologne to get"
54109,0,"I am growing my hair out and I bought these rollers so I could add some sexy waves to my hair. I really like that they are economical and they heat up fast!The problems I have are that I must have a TON of hair because I had about 3 rollers amount left on my head after using all the rollers. My hair is about 2 inches longer than my shoulders. It's unfortunate that I have to curl different parts at different times and wait for the rolls to reheat....it just never looks right.Also, those clips that come with the rolls are incredibly useless. Maybe I have softer hair than most, but they do not hold on to my hair at all. Within seconds my hair is falling off the rollers.Overall, my hair did turn out curly and looked nice, but the curls were a little kinky and with all the struggling with the rollers, it turned in to more of a 80's Dynasty curl than a nice wave."
189029,0,"This product is deep purple. If you're using it for gray hair, you either have to dilute it or alternate it with another shampoo, or you'll end up with the lavender hair look so common in older ladies of yesteryear. (On the other hand, this may be your goal: there was an article in the New York Times about girls in their 20's putting gray and lavender streaks in their hair as a trend (Spring, 2010). If it's your goal to tone the yellow out of gray or bleached hair, I would suggest a shampoo with BLUE tone."
147562,0,It works but the hose is very tricky to snap in & the bonnet is for a small head without large rollers. Keeping it anyway for it is quick drying on a chilly night.
219605,0,"I can put it on but, little side hairs hang out and before long half of my hair in back was out. However the hair still in it dryed quicker."
109811,2,"I wanted to try something different, so, i searched for a perfume with highest customer rating and that's how i bought 6.7oz bottle. My biggest problem is this perfume doesn't linger for more than an hour! I just found out that Amazon don't accept returns for inflammable items!! I don't how the dept. store bottle performs, but,this one don't at all."

145456,2,"i am disgusted to recently have learned that this company and its products are complete hoaxes! i purchased a tube of StriVectin-SD on recommendation of a GYN for my pregnancy stretch marks. Imagine how anxious i was for a product and at the advice of a Dr. no less, i was impatient to try it and forked over the 80EURO for 50 ml/1.7oz. (that size is not even available in the US). I became severely disheartened when i read reviews about the product here on amazon.com and at [...]. they were love/hate at best. and many accused the product and its company of fraud stating over-zealous claims that are being investigated by the FDA. between this, the exorbitant price and the late logic that there is no such thing as a cream that will clear stretch marks in a few weeks (especially with run of the mill ingredients) i returned it, thankfully in time to stringent French return policies.upon my new quest to find another product i came across striadril. seeing the cognitive link, i put the product in wikipedia's search engine and read that BOTH products are made by the same company under different sub-names (Basic Research makes Strivectin-SD and Generix Labs makes Striadril) , both made by the same manufacturer at the same location (Salt Lake City, Utah) however the only difference is; ""This company sells the product Striadril, which is billed as a generic version of the Strivectin-SD product at a fraction of the cost. Many customers are not aware that Striadril is the exact same product as Strivectin-SD, manufactured by the exact same company, just with a different package and price point to attract a lower-end consumer."" !!!! How GROSS!Striadril can sell for $[...] USD and StriVectin-SD $[...]!!!! (again not taking into account the price gouging in Europe!) it's worth noting that there is a prevailing myth circulating that StriVectin-SD used to be a prescription and is now ""public"". Complete and utter BS. What's more, the cream is not only a stretch mark eraser but a wrinkle remover!! a veritable all-in-one beauty cure-all!! Ha!(** the reviews i read on amazon.com a few days back also cited that many of the 5-star reviews were by 1 time reviewers made on the same days, i.e. possible deliberate company contributions. i can no longer find that product listing with those reviews, there were well over 30 on that listing. i decided to post here instead)when Americans are so lawsuit-happy, where's the uproar over this?? more regulation in the cosmetic industry is overdue."
237302,0,"I purchased this product mainly because it was organic. The smell is what I expected, but it doesn't last long. I've used it as a shower gel and as laundry detergent. I must say that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Doubt I will buy any again."
79927,1,"its only been a couple of times i have used this,and my hair is noticably healthy,soft and shiny ,believe me this is a miracle product,as i used to have very frizzy hair before ,work very well when you want to style your hair after wash.i plan to use it on my boyfriend as i see his hair line is thinning up!!"
154240,2,NO was not happy when I opened my package!! The PICTURE that was DISPLAYED when I ORDERED was that of the old product called TRANQUILITY what I received was the new product called TRANQUILITY CHAMOMILLE.That was quite deceitful buy the seller and was false advertising! Anyone who has used the old product knows it is not the same. BEWARE if you are looking for the old product contact seller and make sure that is what you are getting!!!
94315,2,"There are many things I liked about this natural sponge, particularly its resistance to bacteria. It is soft, came as advertised. However, after little more than a month it is falling apart. This sponge is not durable."
31730,0,"I like this mascara because it does not smudge easily (even though I tend to rub my eyes a bit throughout the day). However, WAY too much mascara gets trapped on the brush and I have to wipe it off 3 or 4 times before using it. Otherwise it just globs on and clumps your lashes."
218834,0,"Ok to be clear, I'm a vegetarian, Zia cosmetics user, and I try to use the most natural products in general.That said, I was not impressed with this product. It didn't hurt my skin, I have a sensitive/acne-prone complexion, but it didn't smooth/soften my face either.Also the texture was like Crisco imo, hard to spread, tacky feeling.I would not recommend it, but I will say Amazon has the best price I've seen (I'd have been ticked if I paid retail), so it couldn't ""hurt"" to give it a try. If you'd like a gentle/effective exfoliator from a natural source, try the Ultimate Exfoliant. It's a little more, but it really does work, though I did build up a tolerance (not in a good way) to it after awhile."
27535,1,"This is a marvelous product for hands, elbows, and feet. It is also great for dry skin and arthritis pain. Very soothing!"
133140,1,"This is a great product and does a fantastic job of preparing your skin for a shave. I recommend leaving it on in conjunction with shaving cream. Then wash it off when you are done shaving.The issue with this product is that the packaging is the wrong size. If you travel it will get confiscated by the TSA for being larger than 100ml. The consistency of the product is like toothpaste, so transferring the product to a smaller container is not an option."
181742,1,"The polish went on really thin and streaky for the first coat but I needed 3 to make it look decent. The color is pretty close to Tiffany Blue but not exactly. Comparing it to a box I had laying around didn't provide an exact match, like some reviews stated. It is a nice color though if you're just looking for a nice spring pastel."
94348,0,"The main intention of my purchase is to get some remedy for my dry scalp problem. I kinda expected this oil to mosturize my scalp and prevent dryness. But I have not seen any difference in my scalp after using this oil for few weeks. Maybe I expected too much - not sure. Sometimes, I used the oil as an exfoliator along with sugar for my skin after epilating. Again, am not sure of its effectiveness. Based on the many +ve reviews - maybe I had false hopes on this oil & I really dont want to complain abt it. But I wudnt buy it again."
56937,0,This is and ''Alright'' CHEAP cologne for a guy.This only has Staying power I would say for up to 2 hours MAX.Ok for the Price $$ on Amazon .Smell is Average. Nothing Special.
189233,1,"I have tried a lot of different soap products, and this is just about the nicest soap you could use for many reasons: It lathers extremely well, smells lovely, and looks cool! Looks very pretty in a soapdish in a guest bathroom, or anywhere. I highly recommend it!"
63437,0,"This conditioner is excellent as far as smoothing and moisturizing frizzy hair; however, I'm having allergic reaction to it (my scalp and ears feel hot after washing my hair). Am pretty sure the allergic reaction is from the conditioner, not the shampoo (also J.A.Y.). I used the shampoo before with the Blue Green Algae mask by Aubrey and didn't have any problem. Too bad. I would have given it four stars."
123015,0,I have naturally curly hair in a dark brown color and wanted the strawberry blonde boost for the summer however this product did not lighten up my hair color very much however it did make it really soft. I might try a lighter shade of blonde next time to see how it takes.
161342,2,"I bought this dryer because I tried one at a hotel and loved it. It dries quickly and is lightweight and the retractable cord is a plus. However, after 30 days the coils started burning red hot and then it just overheated and stopped working. My hair isn't that long so I don't think it was overused. Just not great quality. And unfortunately I barely missed the return window. I'm going to spend a little more this time and get something of higher quality!"
204260,2,"I have been using the beard formula every two weeks for the past 4 years with absolutely no irritation or negative reaction of any kind. The last box caused burning, oozing, blisters, welts, you name it. WTF did they do? I am not allergic to anything and this is no allergy... it's an acid burn... You've been warned... again..."
217539,0,"I'll admit that I don't know much about curling irons, but I'm pretty satisfied. I do have a few biffs about it. THe more you use it, the harder it is to curl your hair. You have to let it stand alone for a while to continue. The dial is a PAIN!! That's a big design flaw. It's so easy to turn and often while curling my hair I accidentally turn it down so I am constantly checking to see if it's still there. Luckily I use the highest setting, but if you were using another number, you'd die. Otherwise, curls fine. I definitely got my money's worth, but that's about it."
167414,0,"I purchased this hair straightener last week. It's pretty good, it heats up super quickly, stays very hot and does a pretty good job. The only thing I HATE, but the problem would have been the same with any brand I would've purchased, is that it is a scissor-style straightener. Unless you have HUGE hands, this makes it really difficlut to close and hold shut properly. It's also pretty heavy. Aside from that, it really does a pretty good job, especially considering the low price. Now remains to be seen how long it lasts..."
38089,2,"The product arrived early and looked ok, but when I looked at it closely, I saw it was a cologne Splash. If it contains cologne at all, it is very thin. The English leather after shave I purchased prior to this is much stronger. I will keep this product, but I would not purchase it again"
203154,0,"It was a gift to me and when it delivered I don't know what was inside. When I opened the gift I found a perfume, and quickly I sprayed some on my body, but I didn't like this smell nor did my family. This scent does not last long."
216622,2,"This product is great, I wear it everyday; However, when I purchased it from Amazon, it came to me from a perfume wholesaler. It was not the same scent that the bottle states it was, it was a fake. When I contacted the company, they told me to send the bottle back to them and they would do testing in their laboratory. They said they would send me a new bottle. Well, that never happened, and after getting the runaround several times, they refunded my money. That is the only reason why they received 1 star, because they did refund my money"
192900,1,"Would not go back to normal pencils after using this one, creates a perfect line all the time and lasts all day long :) love it"
148903,0,This is a good product for ladies who like to smell fresh all day. Just a spritz or two will do it. I like it a lot and its a good everyday type fragrance. Save the heavy stuff for the evenings.
65566,0,"I like the color, but the frost was too much. SuperStay is the best product for me so far and has a color I love. These stains a great only if you exfoliate your lips with a dry or wet washcloth before every application to get off the inevitable peely skin on your lips. Don't worry to scrub too hard, your lips can take it and you'll have smoother, softer ones that take any lipstick well to show for it!"
188166,0,"Pretty much the same experience as the other reviewers. Ok moisturizer but its impact on dark circles under the eyes is fairly negligible. At this point Ive been using twice a day, in the morning and just before bed for a lil over 3 weeks."
182082,0,"The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color"
98942,2,"I gave this body wash 2 stars because it does wash off surface dirt. I am very unhappy with the underlying medicinal-herbal scent, and this body wash did not get beyond surface dirt to clean places and things that really need cleaning. I do not believe this body wash is worth the $18.00 price charged for it. Lather, Inc.: can't you pretty up the smell and add some cleaning pizzaz to your body wash?"
4564,0,"This cream is very strong and if you have somewhat sensitive skin, it burn upon application. I have only recently rec'd the cream so I am going to use it consistently to see if it works."
154808,2,"This particular hot air brush doesn't get hot enough. It works OK, it should just get hotter! If you have curly hair and are planning to use this product, don't bother. It may work better on straight hair, but I can not attest to this."
197527,2,"Do not buy this product!!! I have more frizzes in my hair than without using this iron. I even used the Chi Silk Infusion with the iron, thinking this might help, but no result. Some of my hair strands are sticking out as if I am a porcupine. This is a piece of crap, I wonder if the more expensive models are any worse. After using this product, my hair smells burnt. I might as well fry my hair good bye and sell it as fried noodles."
218250,0,"I thought this scent was a little bit too sweet, even for vanilla. I use it for a room spray because it can disperse and smells better. When I sprayed it on myself it made me nauseated it was so strong."
131000,1,I have always loved this perfume and was devastated when my bottle broke a few years ago. It arrived very quickly and I am a satisfied customer.
167472,2,"I need a flat iron that has a built in comb, because I have such thick hair. I was excited to find this item online, so excited that I ordered TWO. The item I thought I was buying is not the item that showed up. It's a completely different model, color, size, and it does not come with an attached comb. So if you like the thrill of spending hard earned money on a product, and then getting something ""kinda similar"", then this product is for you. Buyer beware."
215280,1,"FREEMAN Feeling Beautiful Facial Creamy Scrub Apricot Wow Its such a great Product ,By far the best scrub I've used Its hard to find in my area and when the store I got it at stopped carrying it I got it at Amazon and at a better price.

148469,1,"This hot roller set is dual voltage. It is good for traveling outside the US. The issue is that it is only 85 watts so it takes very very long time to get ready for the job. (Conair has two or three other roller sets with 580 watts or more--the one with 580 watts heat up and ready for use in two minutes!! And it is only $9 more). This set does warm up with 90 seconds as advertised but it is not hot enough. I waited for about 30-40 minutes before I used it. The clips that come with this unit do not work so I bought jumbo clips separately. If you don't need a dual voltage, buy a stronger watts unit for faster heat.BTW, 12 rolls are not enough for thick hair. The rolls size are a bit too small for big curl results. I spent about an hour to set my hair with this unit. But, the process would be cut by half, if I had have used a strong watts unit. I need a dual voltage set so I don't have many choices.Update.....a month later...Now I use it in Thailand. I am very surprised to learn that this unit heat up within 10 minutes!!!! With more experience, I can do my hair to look professional in less than 30 minutes. Everyone said, the curl looks natural and look like I walk out from the salon. I would recommend this product to all travelers.PS: I am not sure whether this product damages my hair. But I guess all products with high heat will eventually damage hair."
136454,0,"First off i must say how much I love the way it smells (orangy, beachy). I would use it when summer comes around and you're at the beach every weekend. But since i started going to a tanning salon i realized this cream wasn't cutting it, my skin was drying out. So if ur an advanced tanner like me I recommend spending a little more money on a higher quality after-tan moisturizer. But if ur not, you will absolutely love the way this lotion just glides onto your skin, and it doesn't feel greasy at all!"
18287,0,"The product is very nice it's self. However, the shipping cost an arm and a leg, and still took forever to get to me."
91148,1,This has to be the best lotion I have ever used and it smells so good..it makes my skin so silky soft and the fragrance last all day and night.Not just for tanners.
132890,0,"This brush is excellent and really does stimulate the scalp. However the bed is made of rubber and cannot take much heat. Mine started coming apart every time I brushed my hair. I always had specs of rubber to pick out. I eventually ended up purchasing a substitute made in China, because my country is pretty humid. Other that, it worked wonders on my hair and my nine year old."
170329,0,"The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though."
125646,2,"I'm almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it's grade F. The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over. Back to the smell, I can't even begin to try and describe the smell, I just remember that it made me want to throw up. Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not. I stopped using it for that reason I never sent it back because I was too lazy and didn't feel like it."
154455,1,"This litle pink sponge is amazing! I didn't know what the hype was all about, but it is worth every penny! You simply dampen the sponge, and it applies your foundation very smoothly & evenly, espcially around the eyes...it's easy to get in the corners. The cleanser is worth it...it really cleans out the sponge of old makeup and keeps it fresh, rinsing with just soap & water didn't do the trick."
117057,2,"i was looking for a shimmering gold color and got this instead. It's a really bright orange/salmon color and its really unattractive. I only used a tiny bit and it made me look like i had pink eye. My advice, go into sephora and try these on before buying on line. I went in and exchanged this for a metallic shadow that was far better."
113362,0,"Loved this hairdryer. Then, it stopped producing hot air. Now its just a cold hair dryer. Only 18 months of use..."
67667,0,A little does NOT go a long way. Went through the product very fast. The conditioner stained my hands as well. It worked but washed out (not a permanent fix) and ultimately not worth the money
73799,0,"Interesting device, with which we were able to evaluate various glasses for UV protection, but ultimately disappointing:1) Did not seem to register in cold weather. Is there really so little UV from sun low in sky? Or is it non-functional when cold?2) Gives just a relative rating (1-5), not a value. The scientist in me would like a value.3) We contacted company with questions, but they never responded."
246091,1,"I am so glad I bought this. I actually bought it because I'm transitioning to a CRUELTY-FREE lifestyle, eliminating products that have been tested on animals. That was selling point #1. But this shampoo is amazing! I take my pitbull to the park a lot and she hates baths, but this shampoo comes out as a foam and you just rub it in and brush or wipe it off. I don't know how it gets her clean, but it does! And it's so gentle and EASY TO USE that, even when I'm giving my dog a full tub bath, I still use this product on her head/face to avoid getting water in her eyes/ears. It has MADE MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER. My dog gets filthy 3x a week, but tub baths hurt my back, and it's not good for a dog's skin to bathe them that often. (This is why I also bought the JP conditioning spray.) Today, my cat got really smelly and I finally used it on that little stinker too and ""wallah,"" instantly tolerable cat. He didn't even fuss! It was then that I decided I must get on here and review the products from this line. I also LOVE THE SMELL - a nice cherry almond scent (same as the John Paul oatmeal dog shampoo & conditioning sprays - which I also use and love.) I was using bargain brand shampoo before this one because I'm a student on a budget, but this product was worth the money to me, and I will be buying again."
211280,1,"it does but of 5 years to have listened of, spoke wonders and but of a person, to include/understand that podia to like I but it did not put well-taken care of I have, now it I am contented but I must say waited for is not it, I create exist other perfumes who is sold by itself and meritted my attention, this to only be one but in my collection, lol I went to a celebration and passes desaparcibido that I do not like, but good she does not dislike to me either"

17432,1,"I have difficult to style hair, to say the least, so there's no way I can leave the house on any given day without using some kind of product to tame it. When I've gone out of my way to make the extra effort to curl or straighten my hair on humid days I need something a little extra to keep my flyaways in place. I've tried several different brands of salon hairsprays, but living on a budget has eliminated those as an option. I'd had previous good luck with Tresemme's Heat Tamer spray and their Ultra Shine mist, so I thought I'd give them another shot.I picked this giant aerosol can of hairspray for $4, which was the first thing that made me happy. Although Tresemme has several different offerings in the hairspray department, I picked the Ultra Fine Mist because of it's claim of flexible hold. I liked the idea that my hair wouldn't look wet or crunchy and that there would still be some movement in it. And I'm pleased to say that this spray does exactly what the can claims it does. The mist is fine and the hold is strong while still being flexible. It tames what I need it to without looking like I have a ton of product in my hair. This is the first drug store hairspray I've found that does just as good a job as the salon brands at a third the price.However!There is one fairly significant downfall. The smell.This stuff smells absolutely AWFUL. Just terrible. It's a pungent kind of musky scent. I was surprised since Tresemme's other products always had a nice light fragrance about them, but something in the chemical makeup of this spray is different. So when you first spray and style, you're going to smell off-putting. The flip-side of that is that the scent fades to nothing fairly quickly (in less than 10 minutes), so as long as you can bear it for a little while, the odor can be gone by the time you leave the house. People with allergies or sensitive noses, however, might not be willing to put up with that.I love this and until I find something with a better (or non-existent!) fragrance, I'll keep rebuying this."
29315,0,"It's ok, but I won't buy it again. It's too sweet, and kind of old-fashioned. After reading other reviews I was expecting ""sexy"" and ""skin"", but this is a sweet floral which doesn't smell sexy to me."
15851,2,"We bought this product, and kind of wish we hadn't. The light is not very helpful for my husband - we are going to install a light in the ceiling fan, and think it will be much better. Also, the battery that it came with didn't work....it just isn't a great product - I would rather pay more for something that works."
145376,0,"I received a bottle as a gift and I've been using it for a couple of months now. I really like the way it moisturizes my face. I use a small amount because a little goes a long way. I actually like the peppermint scent. It's a little strong but I like it. I have normal skin, not too dry or oily, and this product makes my skin very soft. I haven't noticed any decrease in the fine wrinkles in my face. From my experience with the product, the claim that this cream is better than botox is false. As a moisturizer this product is excellent, but I think it's a little overpriced for what it really does."
90616,1,I have used this eyeshadow for years and this particular color has worked well on any of my friends. It has enough color so it does not look white but not so much color that it darkens your eye. I use it for a base color. BTW light skin and freckles.
179315,2,"I still love china Glaze polish but this is hideous. It's sheer frosty pink on it's own - over clear basecoat or natural nails....BUT It's totally purple... if you paint it over any other color,no matter how light or dark - it paints over solid/opaque. I thought from the sheerness of the polish in the bottle and the way it is on=screen, it would be a topcoat look with kind of rainbow of colors depending on the light or reflection. BUT it paints over as a frosty purple/lavender. I even tried it over Zoya Verushka which is a matte velvet dark forest green on it's own. Frosty purple, no hint of forest green-same with paint over candy cane red, dark burgundy, over pale pink or super bright pink, over Audrey Blue, Recycle Grey-you get frosty purple!. You can tell there's a dark color underneath but just barely, and certainly no forest green or any other specific color. On it's own, it's a frosty pink that looks like it could be a topcoat and changes color but not in a good way because it's all rainbows of pink, pink, pink-nothing else, no rainbow. On everything else it just obstructs and ruins any decent color you have on your nails by making it purple. It's just awful.They really missed the mark on this one - the least they could do is tell you what color the polish is. I'm really fed up with looking at a gazillion web sites to try and find out what one nail color is supposed to be so I can buy it from the manufacturer or a seller on Amazon. Why can't the sellers give us a clue? Obviously the trendy thing to do is name your polish something fun or funky or crazy that has little to do with the actual color, and then the manufact. gives descriptions (and sellers) that are stupid, like ""if you're a such-and such person..."" ""If you like fast cars..."" WHAT? How about ""If you like bright pink glittery polish"" after all, we are buying POLISH!How about telling us if it's a metallic, a frost, a cream, is it opaque or sheer, or, let's see WHAT COLOR IS IT!!!!I know...don't buy it online! Here's the thing - first of all, everyone buys online these days so that's no excuse. Second, because of my illness, I can't get out much, hardly ever, so I depend on online to get pretty much everything. I appreciate that I can finally get polish online but since the prices are typically ridiculous, and get more pricey all the time, and then the shipping cost is inexcusable in most cases, and then add to that the more and more stringent return policies that make it not worth returning, and the least they could do is give a three word description.Name Sheer or Opaque Metallic/Frost/Creme/Glitter Color or Color FamilyI mean they have to tell us on the bottle what the ingredients are but nobody has to tell us what color it is when you put it on your nails?And then so-called Nail Polish/Beauty Supply stores online don't tell us anything, while making it impossible to return anything. Your only hope is that someone somewhere bought it and has the time and energy to write a review that tells you about the actual polish, not just the brand or the seller.Kudos to ZOYA and Art Of Beauty for being the one and only manufacturer/site who tells you exactly what you are getting from the polish on their website. Shame on any seller online who sells Zoya and is too lazy to copy the information about the colors of polish when they sell it on Amazon.Sorry for raging against the polish companies and online sellers but NOBODY should waste $5-$15 a bottle on what could be purple, red, pink, brown, who knows what color - you just have to hope your screen is close to the color and if you hate metallic or frost or creme, you can cross your fingers and hope it isn't the one kind you hate, and if you need opaque, you can hope it isn't sheer, but good luck on that one too.Ultimately, it's my own fault for buying a color called ""Rainbow"" that looked like a sheer topcoat that is a wierd sheer pink frost on it's own and lavender frost that is opaque with one coat if you paint it on ANY color.I hope this helps all of you who don't want to waste money on a pink frost/purple frost polish when you are looking for a cool topcoat to give a different finish to your other polish, or are looking for an interesting sheer polish that isn't just clear, but changes colors in the light. And I hope it helps anyone looking for a sheer pink Frost polish/ or Lavender Frost opaque topcoat and can't find it...here it is, no thanks to anyone in the business."
214634,0,"Nowhere in the advertising of the product was the actual size of the mirror displayed. I did not notice this until it arrived; I assumed that it was a decent size. However, I was disappointed to see that the mirror is only 3 3/8 diameter, which makes it very difficult to see even half of my face at one time, and I feel a bit cheated. The reason I ordered this mirror was because I had just broken my large magnifying mirror that was at least 6 inches in diameter. But it's my own fault for not specifying size or at least inquiring about the size before purchasing.Also, it is not a 10X magnification as advertised, it is actually 12X.This is the first time I am not totally satisfied with an Amazon product.Sincerely,Merry Mom"
165254,1,"My hair doesn't usually hold curl well, but this curling iron works wonders! My curls stay in all day and night. Depending on how you use it, you can create a couple of different looks/styles with the 1"". I highly recommend this curling iron for any hair type.My old roommate got me hooked on this brand. Her mom had a salon and Hot Tools were what they used and I can totally see why. Great brand and products from them."
120852,0,I bought this for my daughters who have long hair. This brush pulls their hair much more than I would like and does not do well with tangles. If you have shorter hair I am sure this brush is fine but I would not recommend this for long hair or if your hair tangles easily.
71714,0,"The lotion works okay for my skin. It flakes off a little bit once it is dry, and leaves a somewhat dull residue on my skin. I like the smell, and it is relatively inexpensive."
48913,0,"No problems with Rochas as I have not been able to even use it. When I received the package the cap was broken and when i tried to return it the next day i found out you can't because it's considered hazardous waste or something like that. Anyway, just be aware that you may get damaged products from Amazon."
147383,2,I purchased this product in hopes that it would do what it promised. I will not purchase again. I can get the same results using Ponds face cream.
229365,1,Great company to do business with they always send there items in a timely manner and the product is wonderful! I would order from them again
39358,1,"If you haven't tried Bare Minerals, you are missing out on a terrific product. This is the perfect way to ""test drive"" and see if this product suits you. I purchased this set to use as my ""travel"" set since it has everything you need except eye shadow. I've been using Bare Minerals for several years now and am always pleased with the ease of application and the lasting effects. Terrific price and arrived soooo fast!"
192736,0,"I have purchased this product for many years. The scent is wonderful. This recent purchase was a major disappointment! The scent is VERY weak. I suspect that the product has been diluted. Shame on you Yves Saint Laurent. Another company trying to cheat the uneducated consumer. I am now searching for another scent. By the way, I have purchased scents from this company for over 15 years."
230788,1,"This shampoo has helped my hair to look fuller, shinier and healthier. My hair was falling out more than usual and when I began using this, it stopped gradually. It does not lather much until second washing. For me, it has done all it claims to do. I have also not had any dandruff. I have received positive comments from people. I consider all Phyto products excellent quality. Expensive but worth it. I recommend highly."
203257,1,The result was amazing! I've used it for just three weeks and all the in-grown hairs and bumps have disappeared.

71233,1,"Since ""Juicy Couture"" is my daughter's favorite scent, I was delighted to be able to get it for her at a good price as part of her birthday present. It was delivered promptly. I was confident that it wasn't counterfeit since it was sold on Amazon."
198375,0,I had this product 2 years and the heating element blew up. Until that point I loved my CHI never had a bad thing to say about it until today. I am unhappy over the short life span. For the price I would expect a product to last longer than 2 years. I am disappointed. I also learned my sister who bought her CHI a little over a year ago had her's die on her too. Guess things aren't made to last anymore.I will not be buying a CHI for my next flat iron.
31460,2,"This is not a 6 pack... only one bar of soap comes. Definitely disappointed with that false information. The soap itself is amazing, however."
218467,2,The description said I would receive 6 mascaras. I only received one. I was very upset. I would not recommend purchasing from this vendor. Thanks.

122488,0,"While the Vidal Sassoon Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush is great for keeping my ends from curling up, if I use it on the rest of my hair, I get flyaway hair. This brush causes static in my hair, I don't feel that I get the shine and quick drying that was described."

95240,2,"I have had many sets of curlers, and theses are by far the worst. The plastic ""clips"" to hold your hair on the rollers cause a crease in my hair - that looks very awkward. I called the company (Conair) and complained & they said nothing. :( I took them to the Goodwill."
101245,0,I've tried this polish a couple of times since I purchased it but the results have been so-so. I've tried applying the polish in a couple of different ways but find that I can't get a nice crackle--instead I get silver polish with a few hairline cracks.
147819,2,There is a reason it is so cheap... it last for about an hour then its gone...i have worn Eternity for years and it lasts for quite a while.... not this stuff...i did a test on my right and left wrist of my old bottle and the new i just received... the old bottle lasted all day...new bottle faded within the hour...dont buy this product... it is watered down...
204392,2,"Yup. Mine broke, too. It was the same situation as one of the other reviews. I was in the middle of using it, and the fan popped out of place. I have never dropped it or used it incorrectly, either. I even got out a screwdriver and attempted to open it up and fix it myself, but as was already mentioned, you cannot open up the top part of the dryer without breaking it. Believe me, I tried. Mine took 6 months to break on me. So it lasted a little longer than some of the other reviewer's dryers did, but that's still totally unacceptable for a 130 dollar hair dryer. Of course, the receipt and warranty card got lost when I moved this summer, so I guess the 130 dollar dryer is now going in the trash. Shame, because it worked well up until it broke. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing."
200761,0,"Well it's pretty easy to use. I had to use two hands just to roll it because it was kind of large for my hand. It dried my hair pretty quickly (fine hair, shorter than shoulder) but after I was done, my left ear had that slightly numb feeling I used to get after I'd been at a dance club all night. I might return it for that reason, even though it did the job pretty well. I can't afford to loose any more of my hearing. Those extra watts come with a price."
55198,0,"My 14 year old daughter was very excited to receive the Zeno for Christmas. She used it several times on her very minor blemishes and asked me to return it because she said it didn't work. We were hoping it was be a ""miracle cure"" but it was not. I suppose there is no real cure for acne after all."
143201,2,"Refined shea butter (white) is processed using chemicals, thus stripping the shea butter of its many healing properties. When chemically processed, it goes through a refining, bleaching, deodorization and degumming process, which destroys the shea butter. It leaves it stripped of its vitamins, minerals and many other natural healing properties.The yellow is the only way to go to get all the benefits."
114374,2,I love the ethos of this company. I love how Curl Power they and I wanted to transition into a completely natural product line. I gave the whole line the old college try and it just wasn't for me. I am a solid 3B and i found that this made my hair really greasy looking even though it didn't feel greasy to the touch. In fact the ends felt dry. I tried every possible combination or product and amount and it just wasn't working. for the people I have seen this product work really well on is girls with wavy hair that want to work it into curl. then it is great but if you already have big curls it is just too heavy and pulls it down.
227771,1,"This stuff works you just have to warm it up with water or by rubbing your hands together to warm the pomade so it spreads even. I've been using this for years started in late 1990's and still use it to this day, if I need the extra hold it does make your pillow Oily and need to use a face cleaner at least once a week. If you grease your hair in a pomp like I do it works, if your going for a more clean combover it works. Just remember one can is a lifetime supply so only use a little at a time and spread even, don't take a huge chunck out unless you intend on having it in your hair for the next week or so!"
121092,2,"I've know about henna and used it before in the past. It is well known for its amazing shades and therapeutic effect on hair. I got Surya Henna Strawberry Blond. Of course I was not expecting to see a salon quality hair color, but maybe a slight difference in the shade.My beautiful strawberry blond hair turn dirty brow/gray and root did not get touched by the color at all.Please do no waste your money and time. If you decide to use henna as hair treatment please go with colorless."
41821,2,"I loved the smell in the magazines so I decided to get it. Well...it was good at first...and then I got tired. It smells a little cheap and sort of like pine. I sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what I use it for).I think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long."
83864,1,Salvador Dal1 is my favorite artist . This spray is my favorite. I have stopped looking at different products since finding Dali . Packaging is great . No chance of breakage . The cute cashier at my local Starbucks gave me a free coffee when I stopped by last week. She liked what I was using and was surprised when I told her it was Salvador Dali. Also surprised when I told her she could buy her husband some at Amozon.com.
16768,1,"Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included.I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too. These salts seem to inspire sharing and recently inspired a poem:Bubble BathTurquoise mysteryOpalescent bubblesScent lingers in the airWater splashing over painted toesSinking into the soothing warmSoul comfort misplaces caresTroubles dissolvedSinking down the drainThe wisdom of silenceBliss of EscapeLiquid remedyImmersion in solitude~The Rebecca Review"
98504,0,"This is a good hairdryer but there is one gotcha and I think the manufacturer knows about it.The switch to control the volume of air and the amount of heat is too tiny. It has all the settings really close to each other. When you say go to switch it off, you slide past STOP and end up with a blast of air instead.If you look at the picture on the box, the hairdryer is a little smaller than in real life and yet the switch is BIGGER than in real life. So I think someone is deceiving us."
171932,0,The particles are very small so this is more like a body wash rather than a scrub. It is very refreshing though and I enjoyed using it. It has a nice citrus-like smell and the cobalt blue color is rather unique. Very pricey though - not sure if I would purchase it again.
36271,1,"I have been using and enjoying Enjoli for many, many years. Had I known Revlon was going to discontinue it, I would have stocked up. Prices on Amazon are ridiculous, i.e., over $200 for a cologne I used to pay approximately $20 for? At that price I will reluctantly look for another fragrance after my one remaining bottle is gone. Would love for Revlon to reconsider. A lot of the other scents on the market smell like insect repellent to me."

I like the smell, the texture and the feel as I put it on, but, after a few days of use, I started noticing that my skin was drying and looked as it was peeling. So, while I like lots of things about this product, I di not think it provides the level of moisture my skin needs. This does not mean it may not work on others, but not for me!"

214218,1,"I've used this shampoo for the past 5 years. Initially, I purchased it from my salon. But since, I've learned I can order it online for less. It's the same great product, cleans my hair without drying it out (I highlight my hair to cover grey, so it's a bit processed). It's super concentrated so that I barely use a dime-size worth in my palm. Wonderful stuff!"
159224,0,I wanted to try something more natural and organic so I purchased this product. The product shipped quickly and the seller is wonderful. But the product itself is not enough to nourish my skin and dries out quickly. I feel it doesn't have any substance to moisturize my skin for a longer period. I had to use lots of them but at the end of the day the skin still looks dry. I have normal skin but this product is not good enough. I feel good using natural skin care products but I'm upset when my skin becomes dull and dry. Basically I had to switch back to some of the higher end brand names which work much better for me.
97553,0,well trying this on at first it reminded me of irish spring bath soap. its smells good but not for someone looking for a more masculine scent.
78440,0,"I've used henna products of every stripe for over 40 years--and Surya products for 3.At this point, I'm an aging redhead with thinning hair--and going gray, almost white, around the face.I continue to use Surya ""Golden Blonde"" regularly--but as a mixing medium to distribute just a small amount of another color, ""Reddish Dark Blonde,"" around my head (in approximately a 5:1 ratio). Hoping to migrate to an overall more uniform and lighter color, I used the ""Golden Blonde"" alone, for awhile--which gave my gray hair a faintly yellowed (and rapidly fading) tinge. (I note, with some irony, that it's the sort of wan yellow that my grandmother used to try to neutralize in her hair with an application of ""Mrs. Stewart's Bluing"" laundry rinse.)The best thing about Surya is its ease of application. It's a ready-mixed, no-drip cream that goes on easily, and rinses out quickly. But note that ""henna"" is mentioned about three-fourths of the way down a long list of ingredients. This is a hair dye that includes a very small amount of henna--rather than a henna product (such as ""Rainbow Henna"") that might include some additional coloring agents. And consequently, henna's benefits are more muted in this product--notably, less shine and thickening of the hair than you'd obtain in using conventional henna.So far, I've found this a ""good-enough"" product where its convenience has kept me coming back. But I think I'll be returning to regular henna."

Now I read from Amazon customers that it is discontinued. Why on earth would they discontinue this product? It is by far the best there is for straightening and taming curly or wavy hair. Has anyone written to the Alberto people?"
135128,2,"So you can compare to your hair type to my review, I have long, thick, and soft hair with a slight wave that typically curls easily.First, it is hard to put these rollers in your hair. There is a slit in the roller where it straddles a metal bar to heat up. When you try to put a u-shaped clip in, it often gets stuck in the slit. I tried the clamps at 3 different angles and they kink my hair.Next, these don't curl your hair well. I let them heat up longer, left them in longer, tried using hairspray while they were in, but nothing worked.The worst part is they don't stay in your hair well once you finally get them in. I tried rolling up with less hair to make my hair curl better, but then the rollers just slide out of my hair. The last straw was when one of the rollers slid out of my hair and fell in the toilet at a hotel.Done with this set, and they went to the trash!!I hope to find some of the plastic kind in at least 1.5"" size. I will take burning my fingers over the problems I had with this set."
233220,0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
196466,0,"**just to let everyone know, this is Gary's daughter, since i don't have my own account**anyways, i got this straightener as a gift about 2-3 years ago. At first, it wasn't too bad. It DID straighten my hair. But, since you cannot control the heat setting, it gets a little too hot, and dries out your hair. It was better than the cheap $20 ones you get at department stores, i'll give it that. But, it broke already, out of no where. I was planning on straightening my hair for the first day of school, but it broke the day before and had to get a cheap one. Thankfully, I'm getting a Solia, and hopefully this one will be a better investment.Pros:Ceramic plateslight weightmade hair softCons:very expensive (& the price isn't even worth it)gets TOO hottbreaks easilyThe chi was an okay straightener, but definitely not worth the money."
213459,2,"Maybe I haven't given this product enough time to work, but it's been a few weeks now and I can't stand to use it any longer. It doesn't lather, it definitely doesn't keep me from needing to use conditioner, as some people have claimed. It doesn't smell horrible, but it doesn't smell good. My hair just feels weird after I use it, like it's lifeless. If you don't use enough, it doesn't distribute well, and if you use any extra, your hair feels greasy afterward, like it doesn't want to rinse out. Definitely no thickening effect that I can see. I do have very fine hair. I just received a few samples of Redken IntraForce shampoo and toner for thinning color-treated hair. I have only used it on and off about 5 times now, and as soon as I blowdry my hair, I can actually feel that my hair just feels thicker, above the nape of my neck. I will probably buy some bottles of that soon. But this Biotin stuff is a waste of money!"
80426,0,The spa brush is very nice and a handy accessory. but. the brush is not strong at all. after applying a bit of pressure on skin in the shower the brush head doesn't spin. it tries to but isn't powerful enough to scrub the way i'd like.
137424,1,Very nice color but is very matte you need to put a top coat. Upside dried very fast tho!! Very bright and eye grabbing color.
170192,0,its a pretty nice color. theres some really subtle silver shimmer/ sparkles in it. its kind of really streaky lol. but if u apply with care itll turn out really nice. it takes about 3 coats to make it opaque.
68077,2,I have owned Burberry Brit before and was excited to get it for such a low price on amazon. It got to my house a few days ago. I opened it up-cheap packaging. As soon as i sprayed it i knew it was fake. SO MAD I SPENT $40!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!
208036,1,"I have been using Traite Shampoo for over 20 years. There is no better shampoo, regardless of price. It is so good that you can even use it as a face cleanser. It not only leaves the hair clean - but also does wonders for the scalp - especially true for those who bleach and have ""scalp burn.""On a trip when nothing else was available I also used it to wash personal clothing items - did a great job."
17325,2,"When I first got it, the seal was leaking and therefore I was overpowered with the smell (it was very strong), which I initially didn't like at all. I waited a few days and tried it again, but I didn't care for this scent as much as others. It was okay, but not something I'd chose over other items."
208237,0,I have used this product for about two 1/2 weeks now. I like the smell but it started breaking my face out. I have eczema so I'm not sure what ingredient caused the break out. I'll have to stop using it.
100692,0,"The product seems weak, for I feel the perfume in the oil is minimal. Possibly Sandalwood is not a good fragrance for this purpose. I will order again, but possibly with a more pungent variety."
13053,2,"So my reason for getting this was 2-fold: Wanted a sleep mask for a long flight coming up and I also get sinus headaches. I liked the idea of the satin or chenille fabric and I thought the lavender scent would be nice. It seemed a little heavy when I pulled it out of the box (it weighed in at over 7oz.) I tested it just plopping down on the couch on my back, it felt too heavy on my eyes and I kept trying to make little eye divots, but the beads or rice or whatever the heck is in that bag just lumped someplace else. It was pretty annoying. The straps on the back are like elastic pony tail rubber bands, and there's two of them...and they each have a nice little knotty ball that pokes into your temple/jaw/ear area. Yeah that feels great if you happen to roll your head to the side. So I took the rice bag out of the little velcro flap on the front. There's also a rock-like cloth pouch of scented herbs--smells nice but it's about 2"" square and about half an inch thick. And it doesn't squish down AT ALL. Next step was to try actually sleeping with it without the stupid rice bag and spice pouch. Without all the extra bulk of the rice and spice pouches it was too loose on my face but he elastic straps seemed to cut into my ears like tight pinchy ill-fitting glasses. I tried moving the straps every which way to try to make it feel right, and at some point just threw it on the floor with the rest of it. Not even sure what to do with this thing, I can't even imagine using this if I had a sinus headache, it seems like it would feel like it's crushing my face in. Wasn't very expensive but still a waste of money. On the plus side it is cute looking and the chenille side feels nice on your face, if only the rest of it worked."
239467,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
81967,2,"The only thing I smell is over powering black licorice. It makes me feel sick. I hate that smell. I thought it was going to smell like cotton candy, cookies and vanilla, like everybody keeps saying."
234896,1,I received my mac studio fix foundation as promised by the seller! :) It is what I was looking for to wear during the hot season. It is a light wear and does not run or make your face look dry. I love this powder and look forward to ordering more mac products in the future.

51457,0,"I've seen the stylist use this in salons, but I really am not impressed. It smells nice, but if it is just a protectant from CHI styling heat, that is fine. To me it doesn't add any special luster to the hair, so as long as it doesn't conflict with other styling products, its good by me. Quite pricey for little bottle, but it is a professional grade product, so anty up...."
235398,1,"""Marc Jacobs"" the fragrance is young, fresh, and sensuous. It's pure, understated, simple, and unforgettable.Somehow he has done things with gardenias unheard of before. Remember granny's favorite gardenia perfume, a bit cloying, heavy? Uh-uh forget that. This interpretation of gardenia is cutting edge, it complements without overwhelming the wearer.Notes of Sicilian Bergamot and Tagete mingle with the top note, as accents of White Pepper and Egyptian Jasmine enrich.This is a fragrance for confident, unconventional young women."
198231,2,"I bought this as my second 2nd CHI flat iron because my first one worked great and lasted about 5 years. My first one was more expensive, it cost around $80. This one looked exact the same and cheaper so I bought it. It worked fine for a month and 10 days then suddenly died! I can't return or exchange after 30 days of purchase. If you buy it, buy from other source with warranty."
50532,0,"The file worked VERY well at first but after two uses it lost a lot of its' abrasive nature, taking more than twice as long to work on my nails.To be fair, the degradation of the abrasive did not continue, I do not have a lot of patience for grooming my nails (it is a necessary evil) and I have extremely hard nails but I did not feel that it was worth the money.It broke through carelessness (put it into a pocket) and am hoping that a ceramic will hold its' qualities longer."
166111,1,"For an inexpensive mask, this does the job for my face, especially when I have a small breakout. I've been using this for 14 years and hasn't let me down since. I use it a few times a week to keep the acne down with a minimum time of 20 minutes. However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion. Still the best mask I use for breakouts."
160358,1,"As the name suggests, THIS SOAP SMELLS LIKE PINE TAR--such a sweet, sweet smell in my opinion. I don't know what crazy mofo would go spray perfume on themself after using this--? If you want to smell like the beauty aisle in Target, then buy some Axe or Herbal Essences or some other chemically crap, but if you want to be clean, chem-free, and smelling of one of Mother Nature's best hits, then buy this soapppp-p-p-p-p! The only soap I buyyyy-y-y-y."
211655,1,I have been using Denorex Therapeutic Shampoo for years. It works better than anything else on the market. The problems is finding this shampoo. Anyone have any ideas.
39115,1,"I ordered the blueberry blue one.Once I securely placed it on my head and situated my real hair over the clip, I decided to see how long it would stay. The next morning it was still in the same spot even after sleeping on it! All day I kept feeling to see if it was still there, afraid it had slipped out, but it lasted all day! My brother actually thought I dyed my hair because it looks so real! I was unsure about this product at first, so I only ordered one but I am so pleased with it I am going to order a couple more."

14103,0,"I have had to use this product more frequently than the instructions in order to achieve desired effect. I is just beginning to work, and I wonder if it is truly 20%, or if it possibly my skin. I am using it for age spots and I noticed that these spots seem to be &#34;thicker&#34; than other unaffected areas of my face."
229156,0,"The Henna Tattoo Kit was okay. It works, but it was not what I expected. Once you put the mixture together, it only lasts for two weeks. I was expected it to already be mixed so that I could use it whenever. I guess that's my fault for not doing my research."
79768,2,"I've used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I'd now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it's time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don't fix it if it ain't broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)"
48441,1,Great colgne. Long lasting and wont fade through out the day. I always have girls asking what im wearing. Lil musky but not to much which is why i like it. Cheaper on amazon than in any store.
249777,2,When you receive this you find out that you also have to buy an activating cream but you weren't told that. A waste of money. Don't buy it
111472,0,"This eye cream smells great, just like a spa treatment. It moisturizes nicely too, but the price was a bit steep. I have not seen it ""wipeout"" anything unfortunatley."
4188,1,"This is the best perfume ever! I am a perfumeaholic, and I have tried so many scents but nothing, I MEAN NOTHING lasts as long as this scent(except maybe Clinique's Aromatics elixir) This is sweet, spicy, and the sexiest scent I've ever had. People love this scent. This will be my only scent from now on!"
189531,2,"The Anthony company has changed the nature of this product. It used to come as a bluish thick cream which had a peppermint- like smell; and it was hands down the best after shave balm I have ever used. This product has been changed; now, it is greenish and smells exactly like burnt plastic. I just threw it away. Bad move, Anthony."
147158,1,"I purchased this mousse and it is wonderful! I have been going to a tanning salon to get the spray tan and loved the results but hated the cold spray especially in the winter weather. Now that I've found this product I'm considering cancelling my membership at the salon. The results are absolutely the same if not better. The color is great and not a streak to be found. No orangy look either, very natural looking. I'm just wondering how long an 8oz bottle will last me. I ordered a 2nd one cuz I don't want to run out."
50679,2,"The product was advertise to be great and it's not, I have been trying different ways to make sure it's not my hair, and this product still doesn't work."

249979,2,"Natural Instincts was my favorite hair coloring some years ago. It and I have gone through a multitude of changes. In terms of myself, clearly as we get older we favor slightly different coloring. Because Natural Instincts often changed its coloring scheme -- grrr! -- and my superstore has altered what is available on the shelf, I was never sure what I was getting. I tried communicating with the manufacturer several times. One lucky day, I was able to contact Clairol and asked the important question: CAN YOU MIX COLORS? -- YES, YOU CAN, was their answer. So, I was on a mission and, finally, was able to find the perfect colors to mix. That kept me happy for a few years.Then, Natural Instincts all but disappeared from the shelves. I changed my brand to Herbashine and rather liked it. Then, my Herbashine color disappeared from the shelves and I was forced to find another brand. Back to Natural Instincts!Now Natural Instincts has a whole new kit: some include liquid color, others paste. Obviously, you cannot easily blend colors. Their routine touchup/s are different and just awful. There is a mid-cycle touchup that will change your hair color for one day to YELLOW -- DON'T PLAN TO GO OUT ANYWHERE!!!! Also, the color depicted on the box is many shades off -- AND, the color does not hold for even 2 days.Needless to say, I'm totally frustrated with home-managed temporary hair coloring. If I didn't know better, this is plot to get people into a hairdresser -- which I generally avoid due to the cost."
6988,0,I am trying lots of cleansers for their ability to take off eye makeup without stinging the eyes. I also happen to like a nice fresh smell; not real sensitive to that. This fails on all three counts.
187825,1,Essie products are always the very best. Have lots of nail polish from Essie and I am never disappointed. Go Essie!
121082,1,Perfect! My brother says i smell like cake. I could not be happier with this product! Will order again. Thanks!
142016,0,"The item pictured was a 16 oz pump bottle. Instead, I received two 8 oz non-pump bottles. Not a big deal. It's still a great product, but the item was not as pictured."
42579,0,"It was alright. It made the water green, so that's weird... And it made my legs itchy (probably from shaving before using this. It was okay, though. NOT A BUBBLE BATH!"
112258,0,This product is the consistency of water. I'm not sure why everyone is saying this is the same consistency as aloe fresh squeezed from the plant. Aloe is definitely thicker than water. I will be going back to buying aloe gel capsules from the drugstore since there doesn't seem to be a better option.
228079,1,"All I can say is this: Boscia is amazing!Alright, I'll say a bit more: Boscia is the best product out there for all you pre-teen and teenage girls that get breakouts of acne often.I got a starter kit from Sephora that has samples of almost all of the Boscia facial products for my daughter...it's worked miracles! My advice is try the starter kit. If the products irritate your skin, you won't have a huge container with a bunch of product you can't use."
162676,2,"I purchased this product because it was suggested to me. Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference in the condition of my relaxed hair after using it. I actually gave it away after two uses to my friend. I'm not sure if she finished the bottle but I know that she wasn't compelled to buy another. If you can try it for free, go for it. I just found that it wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
189597,1,We ordered these for our wedding because we were having City BBQ. They were great to have and at an excellent price!
110073,2,Seller charged my credit card 2 months ago and still has not shipped the items I ordered. They do not respond to e-mails or phone calls. I had to file a credit card dispute to obtain my money back. I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau.
209474,1,It cost me an extra $20 to have this product put on my heels at the Spa. A simple pedicure turned into quite an expense. I went home and ordered it at Amazon. It works wonders! Easy to use!
127918,0,I had brought and returned a similar Clarins product at about twice the price. I don't expect magic but I'd like to see a little improvement and feel good about myself. Feels great on the neck and decollete.
116557,2,"I had this straightener for about three monthes before one day, when i see inside the straightener, there are little sparks going off and it smells different, like fire perhaps? Now I'm not an expert, but i knew something was wrong when that started happening so i quickly turned it off. The next day, i wanted to try it but the same thing happened and then suddenly the light went off and it just wouldn't work anymore. It completely burned out. This is a horrible straightener. It also pulls your hair out. If you want a good straightener, I'm afraid you might have to pay a bit more, but it's worth it. The best kinds are Ceramic Tools or Hot Tools and i recommend a ceramic one because its a lot better for your hair. Whatever you do, don't get Conair or Revlon. A good straightener is probably going to cost you over 30 dollars, but you'll be a lot happier, trust me."
212532,2,"This smells really good, but.....Not very effective. I do not feel like it moisturizes the hair at all. I little goes a long way and will do the job with an initial application, but wears off and leaves the hair feeling sticky and stiff. Not a fan and will not purchase again."
83385,1,"This product is ideal for people with dry/damaged/color treated hair. It protects hair from the sun and blow-drying. Since I started using it, I found that I have less breakage and my hair is easier to manage. Pleasant scent."
46932,0,This is a great price for the product! I did some comparison shopping. The downside was that the bottle stayed in the hot sun before delivery.This altered the fragrance somewhat. Consider purchasing fragrances online in winter months so that heat is not a factor.
229690,2,"The one and only time I took a shower with the shower gel, then lavished with the body lotion, I had to take another shower because it made me smell like garbage. Yuck!! My favorite Philosophy fragrance by far and away is Inner Grace. It's just so soft, mysterious, warm. But this Falling in Love smells like garbage."
44426,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."
155745,1,"No wonder this book was wildly popular on release and spawned an entire series of books and curricula! I love that it's Biblically based. I, too, needed to hear that saying ""No"" isn't un-Christ-like or necessarily selfish. This book explained SO much about what was wrong in my life. I've actually reread it a few times, which I _never_ do, and I've gotten something new and useful each time. Learning Boundaries has helped _all_ my relationships, and I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
99903,1,The color is fabulous and my hair feels and looks healthier than it has in a long time! I'll definitely keep using this product.
35795,0,"I bought this hair dryer a year ago after using the same hair dryer for over a decade. When I first started using it I was amazed. I had never considered that hair dryer technology could advance! My hair dried much quicker (5 min instead of 15-20) and my hair was smooth and shiny instead of my typical dry fly-away hair. However, the last few months I've noticed my hair is back to the frizzy, dry fly-away look. I'm not sure if the ""ionic"" feature has stopped working or what (since there is a switch to turn it on and off), but I'm not so crazy about this dryer any more."
49191,0,"There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn't agree with me. Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can't wear. This time, it's the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, & headache-y.Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent & very under-rated, imo. On the one hand, it's a bright green floral; on the other, it's a deep woody oriental. Complex & interesting, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter. It's not for those who like sugar & cupcakes. Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern & up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding. That's Truth, even if it is a pretentious name."
75945,0,It's not bad...just not the knock-out scent that I was looking for. My current favorites are Noa & Burberry Brit but always looking for something new & different. I'll use 'Lovely' from time-to-time but it loses it scent early & just doesn't wow me.
74213,0,"I really like the scent and for the price you get what you pay for. You have to spray a lot on and the smell fades...oh and FYI I'm not a guy that takes cologne bathes. I also wear Aqua Di Gio and Echo and I only use 2 to 3 sprays of those when I use them, I have to use 5-6 sprays of this stuff and my GF says it still fades away."

201979,0,"I'm really happy with the bright, super powerful color. Also, this seems to be conditioning, not burning or painful at all. Definitely listen to the directions when it says ""do not apply to scalp"". IT WILL STAIN YOUR SCALP and take many, many, days to come out. Also, even the tiniest drop will powerfully stain your bathroom or any other surface. I have used many other hair dyes, red, purple, brown, black, and none have ever stained with the voracity that this has. I am worried because I rent my apartment, and if the pink doesn't come out from the bottom of the tub - I am certain my landlord will make me pay for it. However, this is getting a four because I am really happy with the bright, vibrant color and the lack of chemical smell or itching. Also, it is pretty great that you only have to leave it on for 15 minutes. I also am very happy that it is vegan and Made in America. Bleach hair for best results.And like I said ... put newspaper down, towels, whatever is necessary.... IT WILL STAIN EVERY SURFACE IT TOUCHES. One hint to reduce the staining is to apply hand sanitizer to the stain within the first 5 minutes of staining. This also seems to help if you get some on your skin by accident. It reduced the severity of some of the stains around my sink, but did not remove them totally.Update Many Hours Later: Hair is dry. It is a hot day. I am sweating and the color drips down my forehead and dies my forehead pink. Then. I was brushing my (let me repeat: DRY) hair and some of the hair falls on to the sink. The hair then stains the sink AGAIN. I am very worried about the damage this product has caused to my bathroom. If anyone knows of a way to remove the pink from any of these surfaces: sink, bathtub floor, toilet seat,please let me know. My happiness with how this looks in my hair is very much offset by the stains I now have to contend with. I am an experienced at home colorer. I have colored my hair numerous times. I was outfitted with gloves, shawl, towels, etc. and this still happened."
150607,0,"I would classify this fragrance as an oriental. It is on the heavy side, a warm, spicy, heavy fragrance. It is very similar to Kenneth Cole's Reaction perfume. I would wear this in the winter, but for spring and summer it seems a bit too heavy. Not a terrible fragrance, but not my favorite either."
88197,0,"Great product when it works. I'm not a stylist, I'm ONE person that uses this product 10 - 15 minutes a day, 5 - 6 times a week. I have had FOUR of these dryers in FIVE YEARS and they ALL have had some type of repair....heating element usually good for 6 months...chord goes bad at base of dryer. Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and have it break. If it is out of warranty it will cost $35 to repair. Turn around is quick though. Love this dryer but it is not reliable. Unfortunately I just purchased another brand."
129866,1,"L'Oreal Sublime Glow moisturizer and kin tone enhancer is the best self tanner I have ever used. It truly moisturizing without being greasy. It dries quickly and never stains my hands. It is very natural, never orange. This product is much better than the L'Oreal bronzers now available in the stores. Love!"
174685,1,I have not used this color on me yet but i really think it will turn out great it is a nice color
187125,0,I have started using this cream back in January. I also started a diet around the same time I've tried diet and exercise alone before and didn't exactly lose inches on my hips and thighs. Genetically I have the tendancy for heavy thighs and hips.I can honestly say that I see an improvement on my troubled areas.
112508,0,"Love the color! But face it, who wants to wear something on their lips that tastes & smells pretty bad? I have to put a strawberry clear gloss over it just to cover that up. But like I said, it is a very nice color though.. and looks different from the bottle color when it's on."
177637,0,"It does a good job of keeping waves intact and is good for curly hair, but there is some stickiness. When I use it, I know I'll have to shampoo my hair within 2 days or it'll feel greasy."
211010,0,"i loved the mascara but the brush is SUPER small, its even smaller than the brush i have for eyebrows. Other than that i loved it, ive used this brand for a long time i have tried others and i keep going back to this one!"
80715,1,"Great Moisture for my dry as the Sahara hair! I am AA and find it hard to find a conditioner that is great as a leave in or can be used as a rinse out as well. I have 4A-B hair texture and currently I'm using Ayurvedic treatments on my hair which is also relaxed; so I need something that would combate the dryness, as well as make my hair more managable when dry. Great for both! I highly recommend this product, a little goes along way!!!!"
213476,0,Personally I like nioxin better i think for shampoos it also has DHT inhibitors and think that biotin is better when taken orally as a vitamin supplement. I am a board certified MD and have thin hair myself.here is the link:[...]
214072,2,"Sweet Almond Oil has a very distinctive scent. This doesn't smell like anything. Literally. I can't even say the scent is faint. It just doesn't smell. Which, to me, rather defeats the purpose of buying this oil as opposed to any other.In my experience it's hard to find large bottles of sweet almond oil, so I was very excited at seeing a whopping 16oz, but now it's irritating and upsetting to have purchased such a large bottle of this stuff only to find it could well be any other bath oil.If you've used sweet almond oil before: This product may seem like a deal, but don't waste your money.If you've never used sweet almond oil before: It's wonderful stuff. I highly recommend it. Just not this brand."
66421,0,"Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my thick hair, not hot enough :/I'll keep looking for a more powerful curling iron."
207477,1,I jus received my product when I first sprayed it on me it was kind of strong but once it settled in it was a very delicate scent. I'm pleased with the purchase.
123113,0,"I wanted to love this product but i'm not sure if I like it, not bad but not great,I will give it more time and update my review."
36173,0,"I bought this shampoo to replace a green tea shampoo i bought in Asia. This does a great job, but it's not as good as my old shampoo. i have oily hair and scalp and it's gets out most of it, but my old shampoo really got it all. it's really watery so it's hard to get the right amount out of the bottle. I poured it into the old shampoo bottle which had a pump. This makes it easier to get into my hands. I'd recommend this product."
17791,0,"Overall, I thought this product was okay. It doesn't work on longer hair. If you have short hair, it seems to work. With longer hair, it's impossible to comb through your hair. This is a time saver, to have the shampoo and conditioner all in one."
138196,1,A friend of mine needed this because it almost non-existent in the stores anymore. She loves it and used to be a hairdresser. Am pretty sure she wanted it for personal use...for herself and her mother. Great shampoo.
58247,2,"To be very honest, I would have no idea if the product its self is a good product or not, because the selling description with it, was not made clear enough for a man shopping for a woman, this item is not complete, and needs an additional product in order to be used. Enlarge of the presented photo also did nothing towards making that clear for the consumer. Bascially my family member, has an item that can't be used unless or untill we can find the other part needed to complete use of this item. My advise is, and suggestion, is to be able to ask a question of the seller of the item's for more complete information. Just my honest opinion."
72749,1,"Anyone who knows me knows that I adore Badescu. (No animal testing! Not offensively expensive! Amazing products for all skin types!) This product is great -- but it's not great for me all the time. I have redness issues, so I only use this cleanser occasionally. If your skin is a little heartier and you can tolerate stronger exfoliation, you will love this one. If you're like me, you like to have it on hand but you can't use it every day."
23676,0,"I've used olive oil soap before. This bar was big and bulky, more for large hands and the smell was not particularly appealing. I gave it to my sone who liked it. There are olive oil soaps with more attractive fragrances."
29124,0,"While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother.. a bit too baby powdery for my taste. It drives me crazy, because I WANT to like it, but alas, I cannot.Other than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while. Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!I'm excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though. Hopefully they will tickle my fancy."
234718,0,"It may work for other people, but it didn't do anything to help me. It felt nice for about 30 seconds until the wax dried, but then - well, there you are with cold wax all over your hands. I returned it."
208719,2,"Don't buy it! it's not even perfume, it is scented water. you cannot return it. i spent my money for nothing. it smells like burberry but it disappears in 2 minutes. i'm not happy with it, and if you don't want to spend your money for water, don't buy it!"
189516,0,"I've been using American Crew Classic Gray shampoo off and on for several years. My current bottle seems to have changed the color of my hair from its usual semi-silver to an almost blue-gray. I had noticed that my hair seemed to be darkening some but the other day my wife said that it appeared to have taken on a blue hue. It's more noticeable in the sunlight. The shampoo itself is normally a deep, dark purple but I never considered the possibility that it would turn my hair blue. My daughter, a hair dresser who gave me my first bottle, said I should continue to use it, but not exclusively. She suggests every third or fourth washing. I'll finish off this bottle and alternate with another shampoo and see how it works out."
168925,0,"This pore extractor works well on blackheads provided they are very mature and large. I haven't found that it works very well, if at all, for white heads. For small blackheads, you'll do more damage to your skin trying to remove them than if you just left it all alone."
211101,0,"I am impressed by the staying power of this eyeliner. It stays on really, really well. However it is just not brown. The color of the one I received is black with a greenish tint even though the pen says ""Brown 504"" on it."
101329,0,the seller is wonderful...items arrived early and in great condition.The product however leaves something to be desired. Seven out of ten were lighter than the other three. Not the sellers fault...I contacted Max Factor because I've run into this problem before. I think its quality control at factory.
1,0,very light scent that doesn't last very long. pretty bottle but I was hoping for more of a freesia scent. which it was not.
114281,2,"I purchased this to go along with the eye creme. When it arrived, I tried using it by pumping to get some out, and nothing came out! I opened the bottle and realized that they had forgot to put in the straw that the pump mechanism uses to get the product out. So the only way I could get the lotion out was by opening the bottle and turning it upside down on my palm, and tapping it. Also, withing a week, the clear cover was cracked in many places. Today, I opened the lid to get some creme out, and this horrid rancid smell came out. I sniffed it, and sure enough it was coming from inside the bottle! Only one month and it's already gone rancid! I was so dissapointed. I had been looking for an effective natural night creme, and I thought I had found it. But considering how much I paid for this, it's unaccetable that it would go bad so soon. I'm all for using natural plant based products, but I don't want my products going bad within a month! It didn't say on the bottle to regfigerate after opening either. Maybe it went bad because I had to open it to get the lotion out, but that wouldn't have been an issue if only the pump mechanism was complete! I would not recomment this to a friend!"
199930,0,"Unless I'm straightening my hair, I always use the diffuser attachment on my hair dryer. I have thin, naturally curly hair that's a few inches past my shoulders. That being said, after about 6 months of using this dryer, the diffuser attachment is completely melted. I've been using hair dryers with diffusers for probably about 15 years now and I've never seen anything like this. The dryer works well, but I'm a little concerned with the melting and I think I'm going to try a different hair dryer."
45001,1,"To be fair, I'm not a hairspray connoisseur, but this stuff works, which is important, and it smells lovely, which is a real bonus. I bought it to keep my rag curls curly throughout the day, they stayed for two!"
166396,2,"I bought this in the Burnt Brown color to use at my roots and the frame of my face to cover the greys until I can get my hair colored again in a few weeks. The directions say to hold the can 12 inches away, so it's hard to shield your face from overspray when held this way. It will come off on your fingers and face if you touch your hair. It doesn't seem to dry ever. When washing my hair, it also stained my fingernails again. While coverage of grey was great, I can't recommend regular use of this temporary product unless you have precision application skills and you never touch your hair. Will stain yur clothes and towels, so be cautious about how you remove it from your skin."
180062,0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
54952,1,"Fast, fast shipping and love, love, love it. Much thanks for the eye cream too - have not yet used but will be back to get more samples - i love samples----good samples that is."
22502,2,"The product image is misleading because it shows two bottles. Because of this, I purchased this item when otherwise I would have purchased a different item. Only one bottle arrived in the mail."
168453,2,"Didnt get what I ordered! The display said it was ""milky way shake and go"" hair. That was not the product I recieved. Don't let them fool you in to getting cheap synthetic hair..unless that's what your looking for."
110728,0,"We use this product religiously for my fair, very sensitive skinned daughter. However, we cannot use it on her face at all!!! On a recent holiday my husband forgot and put this sunscreen on her face and it burnt her skin. The poor baby looked like something out of a horror movie as her face went from red raw to peeling off.I use the Neutrogena Baby SPF 60 sunscreen stick on her face...it is more of a physical barrier.If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test first (as they recommend) to see how your skin reacts."
53716,2,"This mirror is bulky to travel with. The mirror itself is okay, but is not very compact and does not come with any kind of travel pouch. Therefore, I do not think it should be included as a ""travel Mirror""."
111476,0,"This is a great company with some great products, but we did not notice any difference using this eye cream."
156755,1,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The color is fantastic and the compliments have been endless. It matches my green sweater perfectly!
64804,0,"Mild and rinses clean, but the smell is way too strong and synthetic. The original Pears soap in amber smells much better."
208339,1,I have used this lotion for over ten years. Is the best one to use after tanning. The first ingredient is Aloe Vera. This lotions lasts a very long time. Will make your skin feel and look very smooth and soft. Has a very pleasant scent.
187278,0,"I'm in my early 20's, and have had moderate acne since i was in my early teens. Not really bad, but enough to make me pick at it every now and then. The zeno product is great if you use it 3 times per day. But when you have more than one zit, and you're using this 3 times per day, you use up an entire 60 cartridge zeno tip within a few days. I like the product a lot, I just wish that it weren't so expensive. You have to think, $35 per 90 cartridge, I can go through that in a week, which comes about to be $140 per month on just cartridges. I'm sorry, but for that price I'd rather just wash my face and deal with the zits."
167769,2,This product does not handle the underarm body odor well at all. I would not recommend it to anyone.
220518,0,I don't believe the Heel Smoother Pro is worth the money. I would not recommend it because of the cost.
87091,1,"I have fine hair, and wondered how this oil would work. (No one likes the greasy look!)So far, this product has been great, and with a little effort, rinses out making my hair soft and shiny, without looking like an oil slick.(To further enhance getting conditioning oils out of my hair, I have a trick: When I am ready to rinse, I first take some conditioner, and put in my hair with the oil. Then i comb thru and rinse. I don't know why this works, but it seems to assist with the rinsing process. Anyone with scientific factoids to confirm or {kindly, please} refute, I would love to hear it. )In closing, I did not find this product to smell too strongly- it isn't artificial at all, and smells deliciously of Rosemary.I will continue to use it as an occasional hot oil treatment- lovely!"
211240,0,"Seemed like an older bottle, faded packaging, and the fragrance seemed somewhat stale. I'd recommend another site or buying locally."
102265,0,"It's a little hard to use as my bar is crumbling. Not noticing huge differences to be honest, but still trying it at this point."
88084,2,"I didn't even use this as it just came with one little packet. I didn't even know how to go about using it, it was just a tube of liquid. Not sure if it was already mixed in there or if it was missing something but I didn't want to find out"
111319,0,Product smells great but doesn't lather up like I would expect it would. It takes too much to feel like I am getting clean.
182630,1,"I have used this product for many years and think is the greatest! Yes, I would recommend it to others."
244629,1,"I would highly recommend this product to people that have some problem areas on their face. I used the cleanser every day and saw a dramatic difference in the condition of my complexion. My skin did not feel as dry as it usually did after washing. My friends and family also noticed that my complexion was not as red and blotchy as it normally was. After the birth of my children I have had numerous complexion problems. I have used various high priced cleansers, creams, etc. and did not attain the same effects that I did when I used Cetaphil. My skin felt smoother and cleaner after each use, again without the drying effects of other cleansers. I didn't feel like I was putting any harsh chemicals on my face. I will continue to use Cetaphil."
67952,1,I bought it for my brother and he is very happy with this product. It is like I expected. The fragance is very good.
112805,0,"I bought this to use outdoors to spray my lemon tree.It's only 8 ounces, but I don't mind filling it when I need to. What I do mind, however (and a big reason why I docked two stars), is when the nozzle decides to twist itself somehow into the off position, and I can't actually spray the tree until I twist it around again.There's no indication as to where the ""spray"" position is on the nozzle, and it keeps twisting itself. Every single day, I run into this problem, and if it weren't one of the cheapest spray bottles I could get, I'd say it wasn't worth the money. In this case, I get what I paid for, and that's sub-par.I'd recommend keeping your money and purchasing something a bit costlier, but I can't recommend anything specific. Just...not this, unless you're willing to be frustrated whilst using it."
193492,2,"This is quite easy to apply, and for that I gave it two stars. But other than that aspect, it really isn't fantastic. I used it twice and was very happy, but after just two applications, the liquid was completely gone. It doesn't even work anymore, it is just a felt tip with nothing on it.I wouldn't recommend it unless you know of some way to make it last longer..."
182289,0,"This product is good, I just was not as satisfied with the color as I would have liked. But the product was shipped fast and it is of good quality."
118902,0,I have been using it for 2 weeks.There are no changes yet.The instructions says it takes 4-6 wks for a noticable change
248765,0,"It's a good product, but for the money, Fructose root-booster by Loreal is just as good (and a lot cheaper)...plus Fructose encourages hair growth. One advantage of this product is that it does not leave hair feeling dirty."
133282,0,"I am definitely not getting the results I expected with this soap but it does help even skin tone slightly. As an exfoliant, the grains are a bit too abrasive and large."
40668,2,When I first started using Juvenil my pimples didn't seem to get as bad and they went away faster. But when I combined it with the Creme 15 my acne improved by like 50% within a few days. Unfortunately it didn't get better after that. After 3 weeks my skin seems to be getting back to where it was before. Another thing is the bottle leaks and doesn't dispense the liquid properly. I'm going to end up wasting some of the product because of this. Considering how much this cost Yonka should really consider either changing the bottle or improving it so it doesn't leak and the liquid comes out better.
201880,0,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
43346,1,"I use these at night as a face cleanser and they work great. There is some alcohol content but the Vitamin E and Witch Hazel natural cleanser gives you a good, natural skin cleansing. The pads are very moist and provide some abrasion to wash away dirt and keep hairs (if you're a man like me) from becoming ingrown too easily etc...,Great replacement for washing your face every night - use these, slap on some lotion and go to bed with a clean, moisturized face. I also noticed shaving irritation redness and small acne-like bumps seemed to clear up some with repeated use."
162461,0,"I'm not crazy about the coconut fragrance, but I was looking for an economical body butter that I would not feel guilty about slathering all over. :) It's not as rich as I'd like (more expensive brands) but it does the trick and for knees and elbows it's great."
221600,0,"First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200. I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo. But no response.Anyway, the reason I titled the review as I did is because I've used this product for ten years or so, off and on. And it's the best out there for both straightening and curling when it's a brand new device. The last time I ordered from Amazon, it was a refurbished model, and it was falling apart within a year. I didn't notice in the product description any mention of it being refurbished, so wherever you get this product, be mindful of this possibility, especially now that it has been discontinued."
4824,0,"It is unfair to rate this product because I believe it may have been frozen solid as the package waited on my doorstep for a day or two in Minnesota. I know that Neutrogena makes a great line of products, but for facial cleanser I presently prefer Cetaphil."
211182,1,"I just purchased one of these from a vendor at a carnival. I've only had it for 3 days, but I am looking for more. I absolutely love this thing. The aroma is not too strong, but just enough. This is far superior to the plug ins that I had been wanting to replace. It doesn't take up an outlet, and the bottle blends in nicely with any decor. I think I've found my new home fragrance for life."
231545,1,"I love Essie products and I love this color. It is a shade darker than I thought, but it works!"
98255,2,"I got this as a gift - based on ""expert"" reviews and recommendations. Found it vile and extremely offensive.Do not purchase this unless you have tried it. This cologne is not for everyone - if you are in below 30 you may not have many opportunities to wear this, even if you like it.I can best describe the scent as the juice of over-ripe (almost rotten) oranges mixed with asphalt, or burnt tires. The scent is very potent, and longevity is extreme - this is wonderful if you actually like the smell. I personally find it very offensive and difficult to tolerate. People around me had an strong adverse reaction - the predominant statement was that this smells like an industrial insect repellent - not exactly the type of compliment one likes to receive.People's sense of smell is different and some will undoubtedly love this. Many will convince themselves they ""love"" it because of the brand name, cost and the numerous glowing ""expert"" reviews. Again, try before you buy, this can be a major disappointment."
12372,0,I bought this perfume off a memory I had used it more than 25 years ago. The scent has changed and does not have that earthy almost sinful scent II remembered. Could the formula be changed. It's Pleasing enough but timid and has the scent of talcum central to its presentation. If you haven't smelled the original it's nice enough if you're familiar with it you might be disappointed. Service from the provider was flawless.
112841,0,"I must say, Im disappointed to find that this is not the one. Looks small, convienent, like not a drop of material will be wasted and Im sure thatll be the outcome. But in the end its not HDPE. The journey varied on."
31233,0,"This stuff smells heavenly in the bottle or as you are using it, but the smell does not last very long. The version that I have is a shampoo, bubble bath and shower gel, which is appropriate. I do find that I absolutely need to use an additional conditioner with this product, as it leaves my hair very dry. I only wish that Philosophy made a true hair conditioner in this scent so that the smell could last longer on my hair!"
234236,1,This set is priced so u really get a bargin. The case is of good quality and I also received three samples of rich girl hand and cuticle cream. I don't like how this cream smells though...but anyway1. The stripper is a lavender scented nailpolish remover. It's performance is pretty standard. I wasn't like wow.2. The base coat ridge filler is great! Really smooths out your nails is easy to apply and dries quickly. Nail color last really long over this base coat more than a week!3. The addicted to speed top coat dries quickly enough but she advises a thin coat rather than the thick coat advised by seiche vite. It is a little more difficult to use and I find that the nailpolish musy dry a bit unlike with the seiche vite. I still prefer the seiche vite.4. Two polishes.. It's raining men and before he cheats. Both great colors to have in your collection and were easy to apply. Needed two coats. Long lasting power ESP over the ridge fill base coat.If you are interested in trying deborah Lippmann products this is a sure bet. Another good buy would be the get this party started set with three glitter nailpolishes including her most famous happy birthday glitter.
49352,0,"The product is fine - it just wasn't the color I hoped it would be; normally when I order Dark Brown, I get what I consider dark brown. This is more black. But that is to be expected I guess. I wouldn't order the product again."
110056,2,let me tell you a true about this pill .. these pills prevent from loosing hair but has side effect after one month i felt so voracious that was so bad and out of control I gained weight about 20 pond after three month ... i had to stop it after one month again my hairs start loosing i start taking nuhair again after 10 days i felt so hungry and very nerves i ate a lot but i did not feel full and my body was shivering and i start fighting with every body... i don't recommend this pill to anybody because has very side effect on nerves system and digestive system. do not wast your money .... if you don't believe me just try it one month ...good luck
40576,2,the coverage did not last only a couple of hours. was not what i expected.did not do what was advirtised
215263,2,This product just makes the hair follicles swell up making it feel like you have more hair
104230,1,"Have used this product for three years. My daughter, son and friends use it. Helps to regrow hair that is falling out due to age, hormones, etc. I can see the new hairs growing in around the hair line."
154789,0,I believe the combination of chemicals used would make quite a satisfactory face mask. It appears like it would not only benefit the skin but also the sinuses and nasal passages with the camphor vapors. Would like to try the product and see how it really feels. Thank you for this chance.
1812,0,"This product smells wonderful and is super thick and luxurious but when it came to washing my thick and coarse but delicate relaxed hair, it was simply average. Please note that I used this conditioner with its matching shampoo.I was drawn to purchasing this product because I had heard that oprah's stylist uses it on her hair, and if anyone here has seen chris rock's ""black hair"", you'll understand that oprah's hair is simply beautiful. Of course and sadly, not all black relaxed hair is the same and we all cannot use the same treatments with success. Other that the great smell, this product left my hair less silky than other products that I have used. I will return to using Nexxus products and probably give these bottles to my hair stylist. I will not purchase either the shampoo or this conditioner again because I don't think it's worth its price with respect to the results it provides.Mr. Fekkai, it would be wonderful if you created a product for relaxed hair. Again, referencing Mr. Rock's humorous documentary, if you make it, I'm sure women with chemically relaxed hair will at least try it."
247562,1,This nail polish is a really pretty yellow color. I recommend using 2 coats. I get a lot of compliments and it looks really cute.
236669,0,This doesnt have enough space under your foot.When you use both toes. The pedifix for one toe is better. See in picture how your big toe is sitting off the pedifix. It needs to have it cusions the big toe to. It is uncomfortable
76667,0,"Helpful with discoloration from darkening polishes.Applications are to be on five minutes. If your cuticles are hard or thick, that won't do it. Perhaps if it is used more than once each week, it might prove to work better.Will update review as I continue to try to work with this product."
46652,2,"I'm done with the viatmins and even that I took them as directed, I haven't seen any improvement in my hair and/or nails."
158518,2,I always buy this product but when the can changed its appearance so did the spray inside the can. It no longer holds my hair at all!!!! Can't wait to buy something new! don't waste your money on this product in its new formula.
46370,0,"I have sensative skin, and I thought this would be soothing, it's okay after a shower, but the scent is much too weak."
143264,1,"Call me whatever you want, but I'm a guy who have been using Nair since I was 14. I had to shave for JROTC and Football back in high school, and didn't feel like going through cutting myself with a razor, so I thought I could use this product as a short cut to loosing facial hair. This is a good product, all you do is apply where you want your hair to be removed and wait about 5 minutes and then wipe off with a rag or towel. The only problem that I can think of is that sometimes it doesn't remove all the hair right away, causing me to apply more. Usually the all the hair comes off after the second time I apply the lotion. Also the product has a weird smell to it. It comes in many flavors like apple, I guess to not have such a bad smell. And sometimes you might have a burning sinsation when you remove large amounts of hair on your body, but that might be normal. It's much better and less painful than plucking and waxing. Other than that, this product is great. I use it on my chest and legs as well (yeah my legs). If you have to shave a lot or have to wax portions of your body and want to try something different, then try Nair out and see what you think. Like I said, I've been using this since high school and it works well. I guess they finally realized that men use Nair and finally came out with something for them, so when the bottle that I'm using is empty, I will check that one out as well."
60212,2,"This doesn't hold a lot of hair and my hair gets caught in the scroll design and pokes out. I don't like this Barrett very much. It is beautiful and looks fine if you are using it more in a decorative manner, Like to adorn a chignon."
210038,2,"I've been using Light Blue for a couple of years now and this was the most inexpensive bottle I purchased, but didn't smell like the real thing. I'm wondering if I bought a fake.."
18056,2,I liked the brush but the shipping costs outweighed the brush price. You can get the same effect with a goody brand type.
69978,0,"I bought this with maybe too high hopes. At the very least, I thought it would be a good moisturizer. But alas, doesn't really do anything for my dry skin. I haven't seen any firming action going, but the cream does leave a nice tingly feeling. Might be better for someone who doesn't have dry skin."
95659,0,"Well... for something this cheap I would say it is good for a quick fix, heats up properly and... I guess it is pretty good."
193326,1,I really like it and enjoy wearing it. The price is right and smells just like a rose. Thank you very much.
204193,2,"I had to include something to get free shipping and I needed makeup sponges. That's my excuse for spending $6 for these. I'd heard good things about Alison Raffaele and assumed these would be very high quality. Instead, I received two sponges in an unsealed plastic bag [only marked with a UPC code.] These are equivalent to the sponges one can buy at CVS or Walgreen's, in a 30-count bag for $1.59."
13272,1,Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.Availability of wallmount dryers is limited to a few models.
5323,0,"title for review says it all - half way across the cheek and the paper breaks in two. Sheets are nice large size so the breakage doesn't leave you with tiny annoying bits, but still, the tearing is less than ideal. Absorbs okay. Package not very attractive and does not dispense one sheet at a time."
23260,0,This product from Biolage is reliably good. I have been using it for almost 7 years now. There was a problem with the shipment as Amazon grouped this item along with a Gourmet Cookbook also ordered into one box. The shampoo leaked during transport all over the book which made it useless as the gift it was going to be. Most other sources ship the shampoo in shrink wrap packaging which from the appearance may originate this way from Biolage. Amazon only had the top tapped which did not seem to keep the cap tight enough to hold in the contents.
248386,1,"This stuff makes your skin look radiant and elastic. It absorbs quickly, and makeup will apply smoothly after. The smell is nice & natural (orange essence).I will keep using it daily, and see if it is as effective in a few weeks as it seems to be now."
212094,1,I was given this cologne as a present. WOW was my first reaction to the scent. It is a new scent that uses many of your olfactory senses. Even strangers have told me I smelled good. I would highly recommend it.
169286,1,I like this product as a hair conditioner. Also it looks very natural. I am a man with graying light brown hair. The semi permanent type product fades naturally in a uneven way just like it goes on. Uneven and varying shades of hair look more natural than a solid block color look. That look is more appropriate for women.
190563,2,This thing hasn't helped me at all. My acne is worse than ever. Save your money.
191170,2,"The hairdryer works just fine. I've used a Conair product for years before it finally died and this is the replacement model I purchased mid December of 2007. Just as other users have noted, be very careful of the retractable cord as it does go WAY too fast and has a tendency to sock you in the face or hand as it flies in. But worse yet, the retractable cord broke after only 2 months of use. Now it is permanently retracted and I can't seem to unjam it. That means I can't pull the power cord out and therefore can't use the dryer. What a piece of junk! Of course the 2 year warranty asks you to mail this heavy sucker back and then pay $5 to cover shipping back to you. Meanwhile, the hairdryer is only $20... you do the math. Another fault is that the lettering on the dryer (high, low, hot, cool, etc) rubs off within days. Not a big deal, but another cheap factor. I'd still buy Conair, just not the retractable cord version."
116616,2,"Hair dryer seemed to be a good product at first however, within a few days, the temperature control button stopped working (it would just slide up and down without actually locking into a particular temperature). Shortly after that, the mechanism to actually turn on the hair dryer jammed almost as if it were to lock in place. After a few hours, you would have the ability to turn it on again unexplicably. The on/off problem was really hit and miss; there was no telling when it would happen. I eventually decided to exchange the product but was unable to due to Target's return policy."
250348,0,"Initially, one of the lights on the mirror flickered constantly. I found by turning off and back on it would quit. Now, the flickering has for the most part quit. Other than that, it is just what I wanted and ordered."
64176,2,"The pads didn't stick at all, even after following the manufacturer's instructions to a T. Consistently using a scrub and good moisturizer will be much more effective..."
104434,0,"I recieved a full size sample of Burt's Bees sensitive skin cleanser through Bzz Agent. This product is very creamy and smooth. It leaves the skin feeling soft. There is no redness or tingling with this product. However, I do agree with other's reviews that if you have acne prone skin this probably isn't for you. I have been breaking out and have consistently been using this product for 3 weeks and it seems to be getting worse. I would have hoped that it would have helped with break outs but it hasn't."
163878,2,It's a pity that unilever destroyed the 200 year old tradition. The soap now smells like a petrol derivate or similar. I ordered 98 bars to make nice gifts to friends but now this would be just embarassing...
155584,0,"I haven't finished the book yet, but even though it has a definite Bible theme throughout, and I'm not very religious, I've found it to have some very good advice. Since I'm in my late 60's, and it was recommended to me by someone much younger, I thought I'd give it a try and glad I did."
123742,0,I get a lot of flyaways and frizz if I use this and blow dry. If I use more then hair is oily for the day.
221859,0,"when i first got this straightener i really liked it but more and more as i used it i realized that its really just mediocre. If you dont use any spray your hair will get a frizzy/fly away look at times. Also when i used it my hair got caught in the sides and would rip pieces out. A year later Tthe olor faded off the straightener, the buttons are waring out, and i feel it really damages your hair. Also it gets quite hot and even your hair can burn your fingers. Yes it does straighten your hair OK but i suggest something better."
85563,0,"I have this astringent and I like it, but i'm not exactly sure that it's doing something!! I mean, it kind of tingles and stuff, but I'm not sure that it helps with acne, I've seen no change because of it."
81095,0,"I've never used this product but what made me gave it a second look is because of the name of the brand. I was from Thailand and this stone is quite popular as a deodorant and super cheap in Thailand. This is a form of Aluminium crystral (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O), so anyone who love this product because it's all natural... DUHH. Actually it is chemical and is synthesized, not dig from the ground or anything. Also, most Thai people know that using this Aluminium crystral for a long period will cause your underarms to be darker in color."
203004,0,"sometimes i think it is broke because it won't turn on, then the next day it will!"
244526,0,I bought this based on the reviews. It burned a little which alarmed me and I didn't wake up the next morning feeling moisturized. Also some of the ingredients I think are carcinogenic the BHT etc. I really wish cosmetic companies would not use such ingredients.
248031,0,"I am a little disappointed in these bottles. Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases. The color is lighter, but the smell is different also. I will still use it. Thanks"
182464,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
16410,2,"I unfortunately have to tell you that I am not happy with your product, I have been purchasing Q-tips for 40 years and use to love them, I now find that the stick is to flexible and there is not enough cotton on the tips, that they are extremely uncomfortable. even my children and husband have complained non-stop with this last box of Q-tips I recently purchased. I do hope that you will go back making them the way you used to make them.A very unhappy customers. Patti Ursulak"
121835,2,"The Revlon comb was dirty and scratched. The plastic ring holding the comb to the manufacturer's packaging was broken in several pieces, leaving me to believe this was not well cared for in the warehouse. It is filty and I NEVER would have purchased this product in a store in the way this was presented. I love Amazon, and it's only a $5 comb, but this is was not acceptable quality control and I feel this particular item purchased was a waste of my money!It is also a brittle plastic, and I would not have purchased if seen in person."
143300,1,I have a few moles on my head (TMI) that tend to be sensitive and it really hurts when I snag them with a comb or brush that has stiff bristles. This brush doesn't have the softest bristles but they are resting in a cushion that has some generous give so this thing doesn't bother me at all. If you have long hair that tends to get knotted or tangled then this probably isn't your best bet but it works for my needs. It's a bit lighter than I expected and seems like it's pretty cheaply made but for the price and as well as I'll take care of it it should last a long time.
188159,2,"I had seen a couple of reviews where people had stated that the product received was not consistent with what they were used to. I took a chance as I also saw some positive reviews and hoped that I would be one of the latter. Upon opening the bottle, the smell was not the same. It seemed to have chemical-y smell to it that I was not used to in a B&B product. When I used it, it was thin and watery, not at all what it usually is.The bottle looked like it had some wear on it once I inspected it further, like an old bottle that had been refilled.I will never buy a product from this seller again."
215357,0,"The smell is gross and gave me a headache but it does work. Not sure if I would repurchase this one, maybe a different a scent."
135446,0,"I tried this in Filene's and really liked it but didn't want to spend $50. I found it here for under $40 shipped. It smells different than it did in the store, more soapy and less distinct."
160188,0,I received the item in good time but the box it came in was crushed and the bottle was only half full. It seemd like some of the contents may have been lost at some point or someone had been using it and I got the left overs. Won't order from that site again. I feel ripped off!
143450,1,"This little potion will keep years off,why don't all men use it you can go from Old to Bold in 5 minutes its best to use about 2 days before the special day and shampoo for those 2 days to allow it to wash out a little to look more natural if you use on your eyebrows be careful not to get in your eyes and it does stain the skin so you'll have to scrub or promptly wipe off excess with a damp cloth.And the subscribe & save price for a 3 pack is an excellent deal since you need to use frequently."
56424,1,i am very please with quality and discount price. that is why i shop amazon.
123804,0,I have many products from the freeze-ease line so that is why I was so excited to receive this product. The first time I used this on my hair I was disappointed to only find only a slight shine in my hair. It also left my hair feeling sticky and stiff. I like to use this product on special occasions when a little extra shine is needed. I do think that this product is inexpensive for what is does. If your curious on how this product work it doesn't hurt to try it out. I hope this review was helpful.
88151,0,"I used this product as directed, but my results weren't very sleek. Perhaps it protected my hair form the damaging effects of the heat of the blow dryer, but other than that, It didn't really do anything for my hair."
152094,2,"I love the taste, smell, and feel of this gloss. I used it almost religiously as a young girl. Recently I bought some new sticks of this, and my lips got itchy and puffy. Apparently Avon has reformulated this stuff. I am very disappointed. This stuff is awful. :("
125441,2,"I ordered my mirror from Hammacher Schlemmer and it arrived yesterday.After inserting 3 AA batteries, per directions, I attached it to my ""completely dry"" stone shower wall. Thinking, ""Just in case..,"" I placed two towels below the mirror.Early this morning I heard a ""Thump"" and immediately realized what it was. Sure enough, my mirror had fallen off of the wall before I had a chance to try it out!""I suspect the four suction cups might (maybe not) work on granite or corian but they held about 9 hours on my shower wall!"
5351,0,I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult. I've been using this product for 3 days and I see improvements I never got with Proactive or from my dermatologist. The irritating bumps and whiteheads are disappearing but I must say that the step 3 lotion can irritate and burn all day. Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!I'm going to continue with it. I long for the day when my skin is clear and I don't have to wear make-up to 'hide' flaws and black marks over my face. I pray this works for me in the long run
237422,2,"The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it's natural, but I hate this soap. First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub. Second, it is so liquid that you can't really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess. I just don't feel clean after using. There are too many better organic soaps out there. I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it's just lavendar.On the positive side, it does smell nice."
30888,1,"If you want to have the whole Aquolina Pink Sugar experience from head to toe, then you need this product. Not only is it a really good hair mist, it smells lovely like Pink Sugar. It is not drying and has silicones in it so it is very good for smoothing frizzy hair. The smell is nice and noticable but not overpowering. I like to spritz this in my hair right before I go out the door. The scent lasts a long time and is also good for freshening up hair at the end of the day. I spritz and then scrunch and I smell fabulous!"
172986,1,"I have used Neutrogena SPF 100+ for about a few years and I like the clean feel it has. It absorbs into my skin and gives me great sun protection, since I live in the Southwest and the sun can be overwhelming. I am outdoors about 20 to 30% on most days, and need the the higher SPF for unbelievably hot summer days."
135312,2,This product contians LYE... so much for the benifits of olive oil. It leaves your skin feeling dry and itchy.Now I remember why I stopped buying things on the internet.
150975,0,"The mask is great. It's soft, comfortable, blocks out all the light and smells good. If only there were a better way to hold it against my face.The strap is nearly an inch wide, has harsh edges and is badly placed. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's as if this mask was made for people without any ears. If you put the strap above your ears, the edge of the strap will cut uncomfortably behind them. Putting it over your ears just feels weird. My own solution is to adjust the strap quite tight and set it so that the Velcro clasp sits over the back of my neck. Even that is not truly comfortable, but it's the best solution I've found.Three stars because this mask does help me more than the ones provided by airlines or purchasable at drugstores."
85839,2,We bought for our 5 year old son to help him to stop sucking his thumb and biting his nails...it didn't work for us. He was sucking his thumb and biting his nails as before.
179455,1,"I am going to buy this again because I am almost out of the first bottle. I fell in love with Loves Fresh Lemon in the 70's but, alas, it is not available now. I searched the net for a substitute fragrance and the majority of the reviews included Fujiyama, so I got it. And I Love It. Several times I have been in a crowd or on the bus, or in line (don't ask) and someone has remarked ""somebody smells good"". Nuff Said."
229384,1,"Before I went to Ireland, I spotted this in my Aunt's bathroom and the bottle was so pretty I just had to try it out. Needless to say on my way back from a trip, I bought a couple of bottles of Inis, Inis Arose, and Innisfree. My absolute favorite is Inis. It is a clean fresh scent that lasts all day. It is a must have."
41834,1,"I am an ""authority"" regarding calluses...my middle name is ""Corn""; due to the architecture of my feet, I have suffered from corns since my teen age, and since them I have been wrestling with them...to shave them, to keep them in check, that is. Oh, boy, what haven't I tried!!!...including podiatrists that saw in me a cornucopia for their plush retirement, with the aggravation that, in most cases, podiatrists would leave me unable to walk for one or two days from the butchery they did on my feet...and my wallet. I tried all sorts of devices and contraptions that either didn't do the job satisfactorily or that did it so well that shaved off my corns to the bone...until I found this Tweezerman Corn-X shaver. It IS the best of them all I found; I am so happy with it and have been using it for years and years. I pray it is kept in the market."
73486,1,Love this product. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have really short hair and I use this product every day. Its not greasy or smelly. I highly recommend the use of this product.
70273,1,"I usually avoid the kiosks at the mall like the plague, but I am glad the sales lady didn't let me get away tonight. She did one nail, and I was so impressed that I bought two kits (2 for $60). I wish I had known that I could talk her down from that price, but there is no buyer's remorse here. This product is worth every penny. I came home, did all my nails, and WOW! The buffing block is amazing. My nails have never looked so healthy and shiny. They look as if I just stepped out of a nail salon. The lotion (Cucumber & Melon) is great, too. The scent is wonderful, but not overwhelming, and it leaves your skin silky and smooth, not greasy.I know what all the ladies in my family are getting next Christmas. This will be the perfect gift because I just know everyone will love it."
174928,2,"I actually have the 1.7 oz spray of horizion, thank goodness. Another scent that was short lived for guy laroche, whos best known scent is Drakkar. This scent reminds me at times of an older womans overpowering perfume, or the bad scent of original polo. It has a more mossy smell, and at time I swear it can smell like a locker room, not cool. Not close to his Drakkar line, thank goodness guy laroche didn't name it after it, because this may have stoped his sales. Something different, but not an every day scent by far, and use sparingly."
166317,2,"The scrub I received is non- foaming, has absolutely no scent and is impossible to get out of the bottle. Buyer beware."
231044,2,This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount. These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs. It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount. Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely. The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.
195823,1,This is a good value....I would definately buy it again. It is very handy to keep in a drawer or purse.
104753,0,"The scent was amazing and absolutely as described. The problem is that it doesn't last very long at all. I ended up using an entire bottle in about a week. If the scent lasted, I would give this product a perfect rating."
1851,0,This kit is a little bulky and stays at home when the cameras go out. I like the air blower to clean out the cracks and crevices of the housing. The brush is not protected so I don't see it lasting very long. I'll give it to my wife for her makeup brush shortly.(that's what it seems like)
236446,0,"too early to tell. if it will have any long term good.. . doesn't feel good on one foot that has the less severe bunion..on the foot that has the worse one, it stays put ( with socks only) and feels comfortable."
40255,2,I don't know if I like the product or not because I haven't gotten it yet and it has taken almost a MONTH to get .I know I like Kendra products but I will never order it off Amazon again.
63984,1,"I bought the mini perfume to make sure I like it. This perfume ROCKS!! Long lasting, not too strong but strong enough. Hubby loves it too. Going to buy the big bottle."
58698,0,"Bremenn Research Labs, the manufacturer of Hylexin, claims on their website that their clinical trials produced fabulous results. I called the company and asked to see the research. I was told that the research is proprietary and can't be shared with the public. It sounds to me like there really isn't any research. I'd like to know the truth about this product."
182150,0,its a very streaky and thin. i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage! i get so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter. still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)
92559,0,"When I buy an expensive perfume, I expect it to last all day if you spray some in the morning. Although I absolutely adore this scent, I do not think this perfume is worth the price. I switched from Chanel Allure, another wonderful perfume that lasts for days and days after just one spray. Perhaps this is why I am noticing such a marked difference between the two.If you buy this perfume, be prepared to carry the bottle around with you all day if you're out of your home for more than 5 hours.5 stars for the scent5 stars for the packaging2 stars for longevity of the scent.2 Stars for the price, if you consider how much and often you have to spray."
116619,2,"I've smelled toilette water before and this didn't even come close. May have set too long and was not longer any good. Go to your local store to make sure you're getting the real thing. I love this fragrance, so I just added more money and went to a store that had a Lancome dept. Payed a little more, but I sure smell good."
140515,2,"I had been using their original cleaner premixed in the little plastic jars and loved it for years so I ordered several of these little packets for my daughter and I. It is not the same. It cleans well, but the formula gets very thick and gel-like very fast with thick clumps so that you have to add hot water. I used a brand new container just once on diamond studs and then two weeks later went to use it again, and it was all thick and cloudy and gross looking."
109168,0,"I found this scarf to be a little skimpy. It could have a little bit more of a visor and, since my hair is long, I'd like a lot more coverage in the back. If you have shorter hair &/or you just need something you know will keep most of your hair dry, this is the product for you."
181242,1,"I work in a steel production plant. This stuff keeps dirt, grease, oil and carbon coating off your hands & under fingernails. I am also allergic to the oils & other chemicles we use. This really does form a barrier over your skin so there is no allergic reaction either. Great stuff!"
16925,1,"I love this! I've colored my hair for several years, and I've used many products. This is, by far, the best I've ever used! The color is gorgeous and natural looking. The conditioner that's included left my hair silky, soft, and manageable. The best thing, by far, is that with red coloring, my hair usually continues to bleed color for a few days -- but not with Hydrience! Since the color is staying true, I won't have to color my hair as soon as I've had to in the past, using other products."
216098,0,"it is smooth when it goes on. I have really dry skin and have to use a lot at once for it to work.Its not oily, and don't break my skin out."
92791,2,"I have one of the original Turbie Twists, and I love it. It's absorbent, it fits my head, and it's long enough to wind around my hair and tuck in the end. The new ones (and I made the mistake of buying a six-pack) are nothing like the original, even though they say &#34;original&#34; on the package. The fabric is plush and, I think, not as absorbent, the head part is longer and has to be turned up to fit, and the &#34;tail&#34; is so short it constantly comes undone. Ugh."
92216,1,So easy to apply. Great shade of blonde which is difficult to find and brush softens the look and makes it look very natural. Lasts a long time also.
157735,2,"I didn't like it, it never curl my lashes at all. I have long eye lashes but I wanted to make them curly. And I thought this would help, but instead it gave me a headache"
106287,2,"I have been very please always with Amazon, but this time I became very disappointed about my last order. I bought 2 On Ella parfums By Juan del Pozo for Mothers Day. Yesterday may 5th , they arrived with their boxes totally broken and without any congratulations card as required , both together wrapped with papers like bananas and I do not really know what to do.Esther Aymerich"
231677,2,I was really looking forward to using this product so I ignored reviews that mentioned a faulty roller ball. I shouldn't have! Even trying to shake the bottle in between applications did not help-the roller ball was dry about 75% of the time. It was very frustrating to use and I am returning this product.
130039,1,"A perfect product for any artist who performs onstage, under intense lighting. Prevents a shiny complexion. Doesn't go on 'cakey' like other makeup foundations tend to do"
14526,1,Revlon discontinued a lipstick I liked/lovely color and sheen .......the seller sent the lipsticks quickly and in fine order and I was happy to have my favorite color for a while longer. HAPPY I THOUGHT TO LOOK ON AMAZON. Thank you.
75702,1,"I love this product. I was introduced to these products by my dermatologist, and I have been hooked since. I would definitely recommend this product to any woman out there struggling with menopausal Malasma..trust me it works WONDERS! It covers the area with no cakey look the concealor is perfect for my complexion and the honey light loose powder is very light and hardly noticeable at all!!Like I said I LOVE the product!!"
141168,0,"I've been used this product for about three weeks now and I could noticed that my eyes looks brighter and more hydrated and even my ""terrible"" dark circles has diminished but I think that I am gonna use the whole jar and maybe I will have a better opinion about it!!"
173439,0,"I have thick, curly hair and need the heat that I have so far only found to be available in a professional model to straighten my hair. This one does not seem to get as hot as the professional ones I've used so I can't get my hair to straighten like I would like. However, it is lightweight with a long cord, so it will be great for travel."
242880,1,"I have had skin problems ever since I was a wee lass. I was diagnosed at a young age with dermatographia, so my skin is uber-sensitive. Breakouts, rashes, cysts, I had it all. Back and forth between oily and dry. I tried Olay, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, Proactiv, you name it. Products seemed to be only enhancing my symptoms instead of curing them. Finally I decided to try Philosophy and I have never looked back. The very first time I used it, my fingers actually ""squeaked"" across my skin as I was rinsing. I had never had squeaky clean skin. I didn't even know it could happen. And OH SO SOFT! My skin is so soft that people are constantly wanting to touch me because it looks amazing. After using this product for a year, I don't wear any makeup except lip gloss, mascara, and eyeliner. I never thought this would be possible.I forgot to bring it with me one time when I had to go to a conference, and begrudgingly used the hotel bar soap to shower. The next day, immediate breakout and rash. Got home in the evening and showered with Philosophy-irritation instantly started to fade.The smell does seem intense at first, but fades as you use it. I also use this as my ""go to"" soap on the farm here (we have chickens and dogs and cats) as it removes all traces of odors from your hands (also a benefit if you've been handling onions or garlic). I will never again use any other sort of soap except for Philosophy products."

172980,0,"After using just two days, my face began to break out. I knew it would when I opened the tube and smelled it. It smelled really nice an felt really good, but is not for sensitive skin. This was recommended to me because it is an spf."
191278,2,"it never came after going back and forth for 4 weeks, they said it got sent back... whatever.. I got the money back so it's all good. I do not recommend this company"
204414,0,"I use Philosophy Lip Shine exclusively and have loved them all, but this one is not one I'd buy again. I've been using it for a few days and trying to figure out what it tastes like. It finally came to me that it tastes like orange juice that is a little too old, if you know what that is like. I wish it had a fresher orange flavor. The color is nice though, so I'll keep using it until it's gone."
20199,2,"Neutrogena has ruined the best shower gel ever! The wonderful scent that so many of us have enjoyed for years has been turned into something perfumey and unpleasant. Another post suggested it was to attract more women -- well, I'm a woman and I loved it the way it way. I called Neutrogena and asked to speak with someone about where I could find the original scent and they didn't even call me back. If anyone knows where to find the original scent, please post the information! And if others are as unhappy as the rest of us about this change, please let Neutrogena know! P.S. Amazon, please make it clear in your advertising that this is NOT the classic Rainbath scent that people know from the past -- it is dramatically different, and not the clean, crisp scent we know and love."
236745,0,"My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and gave me some samples. I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles. I have been using it for 2 months morning and night. The Revision website states the product will:*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles*Smooths the look of fines lines and wrinkles*Firms and brightens skin and provides antioxidant benefitsThe product did none of these things for me. The only benefit was softer undereye skin (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same. In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product - I did not. I do not recommend this product and will not be repurchasing it."
170677,2,"This color is VERY sheer, after about 5 coats you will finally get an opaque color and then it peels off in about a day. Definitely avoid this nail polish."
165157,2,"This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense, i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand."
26448,1,Very good cream for sesitive eyes. Good for day and night. Not too heavy.
154795,0,I bought this hair I was shocked when I got the hair because the color was really off I thought I ordered dark hair but it was kind of reddish or Oberon hope I spelled that right I have never tried color but took a chance it turned out okay but I think the color chart needs to be changed because the picture looks like dark hair and it was totally off wouldn't mind buying more but afraid that it will be the wrong color I did get it really fast so Thanks Amazon 3 stars are for color mistake
75519,0,"Based on the reviews of this legendary cologne, I don't know what I was expecting - but I didn't really like it. It's too floral for me. It smells dated. And I can definitely understand why people say it's just an overpriced version of Cool Water. It reminds me of that too."
19924,0,"I just wanted to clarify to those who claim to have received ""fake"" product... it's not fake. I bought mine in an authentic Biosilk 3-piece gift set from Target. There is certainly no way that could have been fake, and yet my product is just as many others describe - mainly SUPER runny (goes all over the place unless I'm very careful). I wouldn't really say it smells like alcohol but it doesn't really smell too pleasant straight out of the bottle. When it's in my hair it's as strong as a perfume, and I'm not sure if it was originally like that. Results are okay, certainly not bad but nothing really to write home about. I think Biosilk themselves watered down this gigantic version of the product, because if they didn't it would be way too pricey for them. Cheapskates. I have still found the thick, original formula in the smaller versions."
73182,0,Loved the lightweight and compactible dryer until stopped working about 4 months after purchase date. It would stop in the middle of drying my hair and then go on and off every few seconds. Very annoying. I will not buy another.
74465,1,"I have curly hair, and the Aquis turban is great for preventing frizz, and keeps my hair out of the way while dressing. For best results, I apply my products before putting my hair up in the turban. Love it!"
238190,0,"Hairdryer does fine for the price, but I am a little disappointed. The switches are on the handle and I am forever turning them off while trying to dry my hair. The dryer IS lightweight, but that might be part of the problem. Two other dryers that I used were heavier and did a much better job of 'styling' my hair instead of just drying it. I thought the key was the wattage and Ionic style drying, but that is not the case for this dryer. Overall, good price just not what I was looking for."
194149,1,Whenever I wear this color I get so many compliments. However it is kind of bright so some older women may want to rethink this color. I believe it is more targeted towards the teenagers. But it is a very fun summer color and I recommend if you like bright colors.
164689,1,"I used so many powder brands,they didnt give me the smooth silky finish this powder foundation gives me ..it is so natural with good long lasting covereage ..people always comments on how my face looks they said i have the most perfect complexion ..best powder ever .but i wish they make it in a larger size ..however excellent product."
6505,0,"This hair dryer has some nice features and it worked well for my wife for about two years, but then it died. We bought a second one at that point and that was a couple of months ago and so far, so good. I know that everything is made in China these days and that quality has gone by the wayside, but I remember my mom's hair dryer lasting about 20 years...seriously. We'll see how long this one lasts, but two years is pretty pathetic, especially given the fact that the unit was not abused or damaged in any way. The only thing that I can say is that's it's priced right, even considering how long it lasted, and my wife is pleased with it's performance."
74328,1,"I really like Avalon Organics. This shampoo worked just as well as the drugstore brands, but the scent is much better AND I didn't have to apply as much to my hair like other brands. This bottle lasted me quite awhile and I have long hair. My hair is also curly, and this shampoo (and conditioner) left my hair soft, manageable, and frizz-free. Highly recommended!"
242637,0,Works good but seems to have impurities in the product. It does a good job of training my mustache to be combed.
94878,0,"Product does cover the gray, but the hair color looks ""flat"" and dull. No shine at all. Maybe I just have too much gray!!"
167005,0,"If your looking for a cheap model heads to keep your wigs/hats in place this is a great bargain for your money. They are great to keep your wigs in place the down fall of these model heads is that they work perfectly for hats, as well as short to medium/shoulder length hair wigs. Even though it has a flat base when longer wigs are applied it tends to tip over due to the weight of the larger wigs, but other than that there great substitutes until u can afforded something much sturdy and stronger!"
206145,1,"I love Satin Color, it's not harsh on your hair and never dries it out. I've used this product for 4 yrs ,it's Great."
198210,0,"It is cheap (it was discounted at $85 or so) but it is not new. I am unsure if mine was a unique case, but the iron I received had a few scratches and wear marks on it, though nothing really bad.It works fine, though I have not owned a truly new Farouk CHI so I have no real point of comparison. Just know that you may end up with a refurb and not a brand new model for this price."

113379,2,"This is the second Chi Pro gf1505 I have purchased in 18 months. I liked the way it dried my hair and thought that maybe the failure of my first one after 8 months was a fluke. NO, it is a horrible product that does not last. The new one also failed and now just blows cold air just like the first. I work from home and do not even use this dryer every day. It got used about 3 times a week. I would not recommend anyone spend the money on this product. If you research it online you will see that not only does the heating element fail very frequently it is also a fire hazard and the plug will become very hot for no reason. Please beware and warn all you know.This company does not back up their product at all. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
95243,0,"I have really thick hair and was hoping this would work instead of curling it and it doesn't, the rollers to stay in tight. It works but not for the look I was going for, I'll probably return it."
17553,0,"This is a good iron to use if you just want to wear your hair down and not too bushy or curly. I have thick curly/wavy hair, and when I use this product, it doesn't seem to be hot enough to get all the kinks out of my hair. It is good, but if you want your hair to be super sleek, I suggest going with a good ceramic flat iron"
250786,0,"Pros: I got the product and it seems like its built well and its heavy. It also looks good.Cons: The hinges maybe noise with folding/unfolding, fixed issue with some lubricant. The hinges were also tight, so i loosen the hinge screw a little and that seems to fixed the issue. No anchors or screws provided, at least not in the box i got.Overall it looks like its built well and for the money its not a bad deal. Be aware that its not lighted and the mirror views might not always be the greatest without light."
4756,0,"I like Ecco Bella because of their policy of not testing their products on animals - because of that I made the assumption that their products are vegan. Some are, some are not. This blush is not. That's too bad, because I really like the way it looks and lasts. Here's some info from Ecco Bella's website - it might just make you shop for vegan cosmetics:Currently all products can be used successfully by vegans except for the following lip products which contain carmine: Lipsticks: Pink Rose, Mauve Rose, Claret Rose, Tuscany Rose and Napa Grape, Good For You Gloss: Power and Passion. Our complete line of Lip Crayons also contain carmine. Blush colors that contain carmine are Burgundy Rose, Wild Rose, Orchid Rose and Coral Rose. Our Beige and Medium Beige Cover Up sticks contain beeswax.Carmine is a purified version of cochineal extract, used as a dyeing agent in foods and cosmetic products. The carmine dyes derived from cochineal produce a natural red or pink color. Cochineal is an insect, actually a beetle, that is found in Mexico, Central America and South America, dating back to pre-Hispanic Mexico. The greatest concentration of cochineal beetles are known to be in Peru, where large numbers of villagers are employed to harvest the beetles for use in the manufacturing process. The dye, commonly known as carmine, is extracted either from the dried bodies of deceased female cochineal beetles or from the unfertilized eggs laid by female cochineal beetles.Nasty. I don't want dead insect bits (or the dye that comes from them) anywhere on my body....!"

15823,0,"Bill Blass Nude opens screeching with aldehydes but then settles into a wonderful skin scent on me ... about 15 minutes to get there, at which point it's nearly intoxicating.BB Nude is less nude than Bijan Nude, but it's still nude, if that makes any sense. Between Nude and Nude, I initially preferred the Bill Blass Nude because I found a Sophia Grojsman that I can wear on my skin! However, now I prefer Bijan Nude.I wouldn't say that it's love. However, this fragrance has a role in my wardrobe. I can where it anytime, anywhere when I just want to smell clean and good. I don't have to think about it - just grab it, spray it, and go."
160540,2,"I have one of these. This morning, I used it to dry my hair and tried to shut it off. Only it wouldn't shut off . . . it kept going and the switch became very hot . . . the plastic housing began to melt! I had to unplug it to keep it from catching on fire!This is my second--and last--Vidal Sassoon product. I hate to think what would have happened if I had just set the hair dryer down on my night stand and it had started back up on its on--and had caused a fire.Like one of the other reviewers said, it always took a long time to dry my hair--and it's pretty doggone short, by the way--with this dryer, because the airflow was not very concentrated. I guess that if your house caught on fire from one of these faulty hair dryers, you could dry your hair from the heat of your burning home!I've never had a hair dryer fail so dramatically or catastrophically. My advice to everything out there is to NOT purchase this product! My next communication will be to the Consumer Safety Product Commission! This hair dryer could burn you very badly and start a fire! If you have one of these, please don't use it ever again! The life you save could be your own--or the lives of your family!"
30394,0,"I've been battling with excessive hair shedding and dry, tight, tender, scalp for the last 3 or so years. I have AA relaxed hair and decided to give this a try. The consistency of the product in the jar (before adding baking soda) is like honey but not sticky. It looks like a thick, light brown hair grease but it's not as greasy. It mixes very easy with baking soda using the end of the brush that comes with it. It has a very light pine sol smell but it didn't bother me and the smell washes out easily.Despite the texture of the formula, I think this cleans the scalp very well and washes out good too. It's very easy to wash off the mixing cup and scoop and when you rub the clean plastic it feels very clean - not too squeaky clean, but not at all oily. The first time I used this I will admit I wasn't sure about it because afterwards my scalp was very dry and even flaked a little BUT it felt less tight and tender and I noticed significantly less hair fall. The second time I used it, I rinsed with water first, then with a littleMizani Scalp Care Conditioner 8.5ozusingShampoo Scalp Massage Brush Century #100 * Made in USA * (1 Blue Brush). Then I washed with the Uplifting shampoo (again using the scalp brush lightly) and finished the the mizani conditioner again but leaving it in for a few minutes this time.I'm still seeing less hair fall, but again, my scalp feels kind of dry. I think it's because this really cleanses the scalp. Next time I may try adding a little natural oil (castor oil or olive oil) to the mix or just doing a hot oil treatment after to get the moisture back into my scalp, but so far I'm glad I tried this."
38933,0,"The nail polish was worth the cheap price, and worked well for a night out, but didnt last more than two days. I used it with a top coat and it looked great the first day, but started flaking off on the second."
80570,0,"Smells really good, but it does tend to leave your hair a little crunchy, which is what i was trying to avoid. Still use it in the summer. With the humidity the crunch isn't so bad and it keeps my hair from getting frizzy."
243489,0,They were much flimsier than they I recall. hard to actually use. Crumple up in hand
169659,2,"the real *miracle* is that they got me to pay $14 for this product. won't happen again.the stuff is fine. not sticky and smells nice. however, after using this stuff up in a week, i'm getting the same results by mixing water with some detangling conditioner in a spray bottle. i happened to use paul mitchell, but i'm sure any other product would work as well."
236587,0,"I have low porosity natural hair, and while this product smells great and conditions at the most basic level, it does not make me want to be a faithful user of this product. It is a bit too light for me. However, I can see if someone has more processed hair how this product can be helpful."
53498,0,"I bought this hair dryer a while ago, and it is alright. It does take a while to dry my hair, and the cord keeper doesn't work unless you feed it in after you untwist it. It is VERY loud, and every few minutes I have to step out of the bathroom or stick my head out the window because my head is on fire. I would shop around before getting this."
223787,1,Very crisp and long lasting!!! One that is inexpensive but wonderful and sexy. This is just a classic and I don't know too many people who dislike this scent where femininity is concerned. In fact ive ordered the two other diamond versions by ET. Ive never smelled them but can't wait to give my review of them-I can't imagine being disapointed since I love this one so much.
180841,1,"This is a great perfume. Shipment was quick. I would have appreciated more contact from the seller, but the product arrived well packaged and intact."
152966,0,"I must say I love the scent of this cream. I have to say though, that on the first application, my hands felt greasy, which I didn't like, but after a while, my hands felt dry all over again. It's like having oil and wax on my hands and over all it wasn't that great on my dry hands. On a scale from 1 - 10, I'll give it a 5."
188573,1,"ISO Daily Shape is FABULOUS for spraying on dry hair, then using the curling iron to create LASTING hairsytles! It won't stick to a hot curling iron, and the curl holds its shape all day..this stuff is great!"
210343,2,"Ordering fragrances online can be a dicey proposition. I've had both positive and negative experiences. I have been an Amazon power user for years and my experience with Seller: BeautySales has been so terrible that I am leaving my first review.I posted images of the product they delivered. This was part of my wife's 30th birthday gift. The perfume arrived on-time so that was nice. However, the disappointment when she opened it with 1/3 of the fragrance missing and the label peeling off really put a damper on the excitement.The scent is magnificent. I believe it to be a legitimate product. However, if you see the images I posted, you'll understand my dismay when my multiple attempts to contact this seller by phone and email have been ignored over the past couple of weeks.I do not recommend BeautySales. Go with another fragrance seller if ordering through Amazon. There is little recourse if a fragrance order doesn't work out and that's okay with me. However, I don't think it's too much to ask for a response to my particularly cordial attempts to contact BeautySales. Should I eventually hear from this seller, I will update this review and rating accordingly."
135745,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
112249,2,"I bought this product because I read it was one of the top 5 ""most healthy"" sunblocks available. Unfortunately, it burns and swells your eyes like crazy and it does not do a good job of protecting from sunburn. It is a sad product."
172185,0,"This works okay, particularly if you are just coloring a mustash. However, there are only a few color choices so you may need to choose a color that is too light or too dark for you. If you are coloring a beard and mustash, it requires the whole tube so you only get one application of this product per box.However, for beard and mustash there is a much better option at about 1/10th of the price: I use Revlon Colorsilk. It has no smell / no ammonia, there are many more color choices than there are with ""Just for Men,"" and it works great. The only disadvantage is that you have to leave it on for 25 minutes, rather than 5 minutes."
24468,1,This is a great product!! Heats up in about 30 seconds and works great. I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to others any day!!
98410,1,"Really elegant fragrance with warm spicy notes and undertones of citrus and something else--earthy and very masculine. The bottle and box make for a rich-looking presentation. This price was exceptionally good, as well."
4697,0,"Smells great (in my opinion), feels good, lathers good (so at least 3 stars), but in the shower lasts about as long as it took you to read this review. At almost $5 a pop thinking I will go back to the $3 olive oil soap that lasts me a month."
241248,0,It is one of the best fragrances from Joop for men but the pack was not sealed when arrived though the bottle seemed full. I hope its not a fake
9879,1,I have tried many many baby products on my 7 month old and this is by far the best. This is a non-fragrance item but it still has a touch of fragrance. It is wonderful though. I am NOT a fan of fragrance especially on my baby but this is so mild that it is delightful. It almost brings out the natural smell of the baby. The only setback is the price but it lasts a long time. This 6.8 oz. foaming bottle lasted me approximately 5 months and that was with a bath every night. A truly wonderful product.
54272,1,"Wife loves this fragrance, and it is always a favorite. With quick shipping and purchase at a great price, it was a real hit."
214579,1,it stopped my hair on my chin from become ingrown.It corrected my ingrown hairs about 90 percent. but you must use it every day.

197602,2,"The first time I used the Chi straightener from this seller, it overheated and burned my hair. I have had/used many other Chi's before and have NEVER had this problem. I have tried contacting the seller many times and they do not reply! This company has poor quality products and I would NOT give them your business!"
77592,1,My favorite perfume. Always get compliments on the perfume when I use it. People always ask what perfume I have on.

129321,2,These clippers just shredded my nails. I liked the idea that I could hold the clippers better than the all metal ones. Unfortunately they don't cut well at all. I've gone back to struggling with the small metal clippers.
243524,0,"I started using this because I had dry skin and rough patches on my face. One review said that it helped with fine lines and wrinkles... NOT FOR ME. After using these, my forehead fine lines were more noticeable. So I stopped using these on my face but I instead used them on my legs before shaving. Super smooth. Probably won't buy these again but I'll use the 6 pack till it's gone."

180782,0,"I went to visit my mother and she had a Vidal Sasson turbo 1875 watt dryer (not this model), it was fast and I was impressed with how fast it dryed my massive amount of thick hair. I go online and buy a Vidal Sasson turbo right away but when I get it the only thing ""turbo"" about it is the word on the box. This is not faster than my current dryer at home with the same 1875 watts. There are 2 speeds and 3 heat settings like it says but no turbo button like I expected. Perhaps the HIGH setting is supposed to be the turbo setting, but it doesn't say that and it doesn't feel like that. It's not a bad hair dryer but the reason for the lower rating is it's just not what I signed up for. Update: After giving this dryer a chance for a month I found that it has another down side - the speed and heat slider buttons are right under where your fingers go. I constantly turn the dryer off unintentionally while drying my hair because of the placement and it's quite annoying."
103169,0,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
97769,1,I picked this stuff up on a whime and let me tell you... I don't know how I ever lived without it! Yes it is heavey and yes it dose take a bit of work to get it soomthed out but it's totaly worth it. It covers so effectivly and really gives you that flawless skin we are all serching for. I am super pale and have huge pores so I was worried about the color but nat 2 works great! Deff worth a try!
84892,0,All the positive reviews got me really excited but it didnt get rid of anything for me. I guess i am just one of the few that will have to wait out the acne instead of using products to get rid of them because i have seriously tried everything. 3 stars for the price

110370,0,"While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother.. a bit too baby powdery for my taste. It drives me crazy, because I WANT to like it, but alas, I cannot.Other than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while. Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!I'm excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though. Hopefully they will tickle my fancy."
248652,1,"This stuff smells great. I was at a bar with my buddies talking to a friend and she was wearing this perfume. I found out about this lovely, inexpensive perfume from her and purchased it for my girlfriend.Its got a kind of sexy fruity/candy smell to it.It's great for those perky, innocent teenyboppers in high school, playful enough for college chicks, and sophisticated enough for office use. I'd encourage women of all ages to try this perfume out. It's rather inexpensive and smells wonderful."
76978,0,"Scented soaps, just like perfumes and colognes, are a subjective matter and as such; I cannot actually criticize or say this is a bad soap, because in and of itself- it is a quality soap-just too strongly scented.If you like Patchouli or know others who do and would like to consider this as a something for your personal use or a gift, keep in mind that this soap bar is heavily scented.I bought it and the response from those who used it, was that the scent was too overpowering for their taste(it actually permeated one floor of the home after someone used it in a shower).Now- if you like this scent and you like it on the strong side- this could be a good thing.If you like it more subtle, than this bar of soap is going to smell overpowering to you.All in all- if you consider buying this, think of the Patchouli scent and how strong you enjoy its essence, because this brand is definitely not subtle."
239173,0,I ended up giving this to my husband as I couldn't get it to lather in my hair. His hair is much shorter and didn't seem to bother him as much. The smell is great however!
1682,0,"I purchased this product thinking I would get the same product I ordered previously. I received about 4 ounces less per bottle at the same price. My own fault, I guess that's what happens if you make assumptions instead of reading the ads. I think I'll look for a more reasonable priced product next time."

28064,2,I like other Cellex C products and always thought a slight stinging just meant it was strong and effective. But the strenghth of this was alarming! It warns it is not for sensitive skin but they eye area in general is delicate. After two uses I was left with hard burned patches under my eyes which went away within a week. I do not have very sensitive skin. If you want industrial strenth eye cream this may be for you but for everyone else I'd say avoid it.
92696,2,"The original DiamonDeb files were fantastic. I am still using the one I've had for 40 years. Sorry to say, I bought two a couple years ago and was again disappointed to find that a great product had cratered. The new ones are rough, coarse, and of no use to me. I threw them away. Too bad, America, another great product has fallen due to manufacture overseas."

18734,2,"I bought this lip gloss looking for something that would last as long as a lip stain. The application isn't that bad (twist and wait), and the taste isn't bad, but as soon as I put it on, it's gone 30 minutes later. I put it on and it's goopy and sticky because it's a gloss, but after I wait for it to set, it still comes off within 30 minutes. And I'm not obsessively licking or chewing my lips or anything! Honestly, both cheap lipstick and lipstain from the drugstore last 10 times as long as this (and are MUCH cheaper.) Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't last and I find it ridiculously expensive."
171500,0,"I am VERY pale and I got this product to try out sunless tanning again! I have tried other product before but I end up looking orange! I read great reviews and I was super excited to get this! Once I got it, I don't know if I expected too much but the tan I got doesn't look as natural as I would like it to. I don't look orange (unless I over-apply) I have to be very careful on how I apply it or else it might not look even. The color looks super dark on my ankles which screams out SUNLEES TANNER!!! Maybe I just need a lighter tanning lotion? Otherwise,it's an ok alternative to tanning. I might have to keep looking though if I want to look more natural!"

233235,0,"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it."
37156,0,"I bought this out of necessity when my skin was so cracked it was bleeding in addition to its normal flaking (gross, I know). This is a very very ""heavy"" feeling product, I felt like my skin was being coated in a glycerin shell- which I hate. BUT I have to give it credit because when I applied it right after a shower (to lock in moisture, then I could go the day without much flaking. Eventually my skin healed enough that the crack went away. I wouldn't say that it's due to this product though. I don't feel like it was active in healing my skin, just prevented it from getting worse. In my opinion, the normal non intensive Curel is a better general moisturizer, or even other lotions such as Lubriderm. This is good to help with major cracks by sealing the skin more against the environment though."
55921,2,"Ah, Neutrogena triple protect! Self proclaiming to guard the skin via soothing razor irritation, healing dry skin, and helping to fight the signs of aging with its SPF 20 sunscreen protection. That's all fine and dandy until you flip the bottle over only to read the fine print on the reverse side where it is revealed that (emphasis mine):""This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT SKIN CANCER OR EARLY SKIN AGING""Reading between the lines, this implies that it only affords protection against UVB rays. Disappointing in that this lotion really does a great job in the after-shave uses that it is touted for. Unfortunately, in the end, its an expensive product that underwhelms in the skin protection department."

Very pretty brush."
54037,2,"I liked the flocking on the rollers so my straight hair didn't slip out so easily, BUT the wire clips scrape off the flocking. Also, the wire clips for the super-jumbo rollers are not long enough to stick out beyond the roller enough to hold the hair! The roller just flipped right over the clip and fell out. I tried it different ways and couldn't get them to work. (I used rollers with these clips for years, so I know how to use them.)Also, even though I rolled the hair on the rollers smoothly, my hair came out with awful crimps! I'm guessing it's because of the slot in the middle that goes all of the way through to one side the roller. Then there's nowhere in the case to store the clips. Where do I keep them? Couldn't they have made a slot so I could keep them with the rollers?By the time I finished rolling my hair, the rollers were so hot as to burn my hands. When I took them out after they cooled, I had to use my curling iron to fix the crimps in my hair, and there was very little wave after an hour. I can't stand these rollers, and they're going back right away."
189500,0,"The scent was not what I expected after reading the description of it. Said it was made with Florida orange oil and grapefruit seed extract, so I thought it would have a citrus scent. However, when I used it, the scent was a very strong floral one. I don't hate floral scents, but this floral scent was not pleasant to my nose. It was very strong and not subtle or unique. It was like a cheap air freshener floral scent. Unfortunately, I do not live near a retail store that sells Molton Brown products so I did not have the opportunity to smell the sample before purchasing it. I bought Naran Ji Fine solely based on the overwhelming high reviews from various websites and for it being their number one seller. Having said all of this, the scent does last a long time and if you like a strong floral scent, you may like it, but it was not the right scent for me."

201294,1,"I received this as a gift in the Milk and Shea butter scent.. I like the mild scent as I like to wear different perfumes, but that's not why I loved this stuff. Not only do I use it as a body wash but I use it to shave as well. It works fantastically and my legs feel SO soft and lightly moisturized. Whenever this bottle is gone I'm certain I'll be buying another bottle."
187566,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
103432,2,"I should have read the reviews before ordering. Over six dollars is way too much to spend for two ounces of rubbing alcohol! Also, it has aluminum in it which has been linked to Alzheimer's, so I won't be using it at all. I really do know better, could kick myself for wasting money."

9276,1,"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this."

With an ingredient list a mile long, I'm not surprised that it burned! ;-) Just because something is ""natural"" or ""organic"" doesn't mean it still can't be toxic.I'm still giving this item three-stars simply because it might very well work for some people. I just wish there were a way to send-off for a sample of the lotion first, to see if it's going to irritate your skin before you purchase the kit."
137252,2,"As one reviewer has already mentioned this product seemed to cause an allergic reaction on me as well. I have worn it twice only on my face ears and neck.

I would really like to know what is different about this sunscreen so I can avoid it in others as well. If anyone knows, please advise. The reaction lasts several days."
61577,0,I used the original product in the 70s and 80s when it was available. It was a dark rich brown color and the perfume was the very finest. This product is much weaker and lighter but still pleasant but nothing like it used to be. I am still undecided about this scent in the current formula.
203712,0,"This product is really not as great as it claims to be. I was not particularly fond of the fig scent either. I did not see a difference in my hair as a result of using this product when compared to other sulfate-free products.

It is a great iron, but only plan to have it for a year. If you are only interested in a short time using a great iron, and then spending the 100+ dollars again, then GET THIS IRON. I was VERY disappointed when it broke, as I thought I'd get 2-3 years out of it. It is made really lightweight...so I guess it should not have surprised me. I just hate spending more money so soon. I am going to send it to the company and see if they will help me. SAVE your receipt. I typically ALWAYS do, but for some reason I can't find this one. ugh"
67361,0,"Purchased this online because of the price and it's definitely my fav cologne at the moment. Beware, once purchased, there is no return and for some reason my bottle must be really old/expired as it does NOT smell the same as the bottles I have previously purchased at dept. stores. I have both bottles with me and did a side-by-side smell test (yes, seriously) and my friends can notice a difference as well so it's not just me. Well one of them couldn't but he doesn't even wear cologne. The scent is just not as bright or fresh.. no other way to really describe it. I can't return it so I'm thinking of giving this expired one away and keep buying from Macy's even it if does cost more. At least it will smell right. It's strange that they can mail it to you yet you cannot mail it back claiming it's a dangerous good."
48960,1,"My husband had been searching for a cologne that smelled like his one-time favorite called, Caribe, which he used to only be able to buy in the Bahamas.

He was extremely happy with the delivery and packaging and will be purchasing more in the future. Great experience!"

I've had other irons produce a weird smell before, but that was after I had had it for a few years.I recently gave the iron to my caucasian friend (straight, fine hair) who needed one and she had the same complaint: it straightens well, but produces a weird smell."

215878,2,"I used to love this product and was so happy to find it on Amazon. I ordered three bottles so that I would have enough to last. Unfortuantely it came in a poly envelope and one of the bottles had ruptured and leaked all through the packaging. The remaining two bottles have a very strong alcohol smell, it smells exactly like rubbing alcohol. This is an Aveda product that I used for years, it had a wonderful essential oil smell but what I received was nothing like the product used to be. My theory is that the product is either spoiled and they are still selling it, or someone is just selling something completly different in an Aveda bottle. Please do not waste your money on this."

It is usually a couple dollars cheaper for the same quantity.Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion - 18 oz.Both are fragrance free light moisturizers and ingredients are very similar. Aveeno has the most affordable body lotions I have found that have few toxic chemicals. I also like that the pump bottles close easily by turning to the side.

51807,0,"This is one of those popular colognes out there which every reviewer loves. And thus I also bought it w/o actually using it. Do I like it? Yes I love it and I have used it everyday for long time. But do I think this cologne is worth money spent? Well it really depends. Here are some thoughts -First of all, this smells simply great. I wish I could smell it all day. No joke. When you will put it on , you will instantly fall in love.What sucks is that after 2-3 hours you wont be even able to feel it which really sucks. So this is something that I only wear for short time meetings, date, party, get-together, dinner kind of stuff. Nothing like where I know I will be staying more than 3 hours like work, or night out and stuff.This is must of any person who is building up their cologne collection but if you are in market for your first good quality cologne and want to get full worth out of your money spent, I would not strongly recommend it because it wont make you very excited though I am sure it will make you smile.Advice - I have learned hard way that always buy scents after trying them on. For me, I personally want longevity in my colognes. There is no use of shelling 40-70 bucks on something which lasts for 2- 3hours.So if you are out there for your first cologne, get Jean Paul gaultier Le male. I know it is common, I know it is best selling but that is what happens to something that is good. If something is nice people will buy it and it will become common but that doesnt make it a bad cologne. It lasts on me forever like 10 hours and has great smell.Another advice is that always go to a store on weekend, and try something that you would buy. See if the longevity is decent enough for you. 5-6 hours is something that I consider good.Once again this is a great cologne. 3 stars are because it sucks at longevity. If this could last around 6 hours, it could easily be my fav cologne."
49657,2,"I helped my supervisor with an online order for this product at the Lauder website. When I placed the order the first time, I failed to enter a ""password,"" and when the page refreshed, it defaulted to standard shipping, which I didn't catch until after the transaction was complete. I called and was told that the shipping could not be changed but that the order would be cancelled and I could place a new order with the correct shipping. The order was not cancelled, and we received two shipments. I have now made FOUR calls to request a postage-paid return label. The first three times, they promised to e-mail the label. I have supplied 3 different e-mail addresses and received nothing. So I asked them to either fax it (they would not) or snail-mail it, which they said will take up to two weeks to receive. Meantime, my supervisor has a charge on his card for a package that is sitting on my desk unopened--plus $12.00 for the original shipment that was supposed to be cancelled. Lauder's customer service failed 1) to permit changing the shipping method, 2) to cancel the original order, 3) to send a shipping label in a timely fashion. Crappy, crappy customer service.

They are two completely different products- as I found out after I did some internet research. This NOW product is extremely grainy and crumbly and very difficult to apply. I lost about half of it from the jar to my elbow :). Raw shea butter goes on smoother and retains much more of shea's healing and moisturizing properties. However, this NOW product is half the price of AAA shea butter so if you are looking for just a good deal on moisturizer, try this. If you are able to afford a bit more on a great moisturizer- look for unrefined/raw shea butter."

And the taupe color is phenomenal - I have fair skin and blue eyes, and the mid-brown (slightly darker than the online photos I've seen) isn't too harsh while still emphasizing my eyes. This is a hard color to find in stores (at least in my area). And you can't beat the price, so don't bother about those expensive brands."
158142,2,"Not what I expected, just a curling iron w/ bristles. Handle is quite fat, hair got tangled and the quick release didn't work as well. At one point, I had to pull the plug, and take off the brush portion to untangle my hair!Not using it very much. Hair definetly must be almost dry for this to work. Also quite noisy."
89544,2,"Worked great first use - could switch through sounds and turn massage on/off. Rinsed off after use and could not turn off the sounds, had to remove battery to turn it off.Very comfortable, just don't expect to count on the features working well."
111904,0,This is a great product but over priced. I didn't realize this product was only 1.7oz. Its VERY expensive. I've seen in store spa sales with the full size for a similar price.

233728,0,"I wanted red hair without all the damage from chemicals. My hair is naturally a ashy dark brown, which I then highlighted blond, and then covered with semi-permanent ""burgundy"" hair dye. Needless to say, my fine hair was a bit fried. I bought this from my local grocery store, and decided to give it a try.I mixed the powder with hot water in a plastic bowl and let it sit for an hour before applying. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it would not stick to my hair, and just felt like I was piling on mud and trying to make it stick. My bathroom was a mess. I would definitely recommend having someone help you with it. Also, apply Vaseline to your skin before starting. Once I was done, I put on the plastic cap, and left it for 2 hours, occasionally using a blow dryer to make it hot. It took a lot of conditioner to wash it out of my hair.As soon as I was done, I blow-dried my hair. I was hoping to get a dark, burgundy color. Instead I got super bright orange hair. I read that the color eventually gets darker, so I didn't freak out too much. The next day my hair was a dark orange. After a week of washing it, it is now more of an auburn color.So this is a bit of a mixed review. I ended up loving the ""orange"" color I got because it somehow brings out my eye color and makes it pop, but if you're buying this hoping for a dark red, expect it to be more orange than red. It was very hard to apply, and because I hate wearing gloves, my fingers are still stained from the application. It also smells ""muddy"" and leafy, but I didn't really have a problem with it. This definitely leaves your hair VERY shiny and glossy, so as far as conditioning, it works.I am only giving it 3 stars because it is messy, and more orange than red. HOWEVER, I'll most definitely be buying it again because I accidentally found my new favorite hair color."
149602,2,"Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord. Farouk refuses to send replacement cord at any cost so my wife now has a worthless $100 flat iron. Power cord, which should last indefinitely, is very poorly designed."

55528,2,"My husband calls me a marketer's wet dream because I tend to believe any reasonable claim made b a product. I'm not stupid enough to think I can eat like a pig, never get off the couch and still lose weight by taking Brand X Magic Fat-Burning Pills (I wish, though...)but when a product claims to have an SPF (which I understand to signify Sun Protection Factor) of 20, I assume that it will, in fact, go some way towards protecting my skin from those icky ultraviolet rays. Sadly, this is not the case with Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20. I slapped this stuff on over an already decent base tan and spent four hours shopping in Cozumel, only to be confronted with a boiled-looking face upon my return to the ship. I have since been told that the caveat appears, in tiny print on the tube, that wearing a sunscreen under this product is recommended. Well, what's up with that?? If I wanted to smear multiple layers of product on my skin, I'd wear makeup! And if it says ""SPF"" on the tube, shouldn't there be some, you know, actual SPF? As a tinted moisturizer this product is completely satsfactory, but as far as SPF goes, you might as well use Vaseline."
167882,0,"I was looking for a light daily lotion that would also provide sun-protection and be great on my sensitive skin. Although this Eucerin Q10 formula is not heavy and oily like some it is also not light as it has a slightly oily feel with a little tac to it.In order to compare, I put Olay Complete moisture lotion UV defense for sensitive skin on one side of my face and the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 on the other. The Eucerin felt slightly heavier and was not as comfortable throughout the day to my sensitive skin as the Olay was (most suntan lotions feel like they burn to me - although the Eucerin did not burn I knew it was there and I am not talking about the slightly oily texture but rather how my skin felt).I sure wish Eucerin had a light and non-greasy daily lotion for sensitive skin with UV 15 protection. I don't understand why not."

72257,0,"I purchased this dryer several months ago after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon. I'm still waiting for the bliss that other reviewers apparently feel when they use it. It's a hair dryer, guys. It blows hot air. It has multiple heat and air settings and a cold air button -- just like a $10 Conair from Walgreens.One small annoyance: The temperature and air speed setting toggles are poorly placed. They are on the handle like other dryers but they sit right where your fingers rest, making it easy to inadvertently change it to a lower setting when moving it around to dry your hair. Irksome.The product works ok, and it should, for $85.00. Apparently the Solano name justifies the exorbitant price.Still, I can't believe I paid $85.00 for a hair dryer..."
229604,1,This product does just what I expected. It increases my body temperature and helps me trim down on my trouble areas.
166744,1,Best self tanner I have tried and I have tried a lot.great color great coverage.will be using here on out.
75468,2,"My wife had this hair dryer for years and it worked perfectly well until just recently (9/12). A few weeks ago she used it to dry her hair, turned it off and placed it on the sink counter as she has always done. About one hour later we heard it, completely on its own, start running at a very high speed for about 10 seconds and then stop. By the time I entered the bathroom to see what was going on I could detect the very strong odor of a burnt electrical device. I discoverd the very hot hair dryer on the sink counter and the counter top scorched black. This thing could have started a fire! If you have one I suggest you dispose of it immediately before it burns down your house."
194938,0,"Not a bad Shampoo, can't really tell the difference in my hair to be honest. My hair is growing really thin up there so I needed to try something different. I probably won't buy this again...but hey, it may work for you."
191585,1,"This stuff rocks! I have tried countless self tanners and finally I have found one that does NOT stink and gives a great tan! My girlfriend commented last night..""so, I see someone decided to go to the tanning bed after all!"" I replied, ""nope! from a bottle!"" She was speechless. When I hit 30 a few years (ahem! ;0) ) ago, I decided I wanted to continue looking young so I decided to stop trying to get a tan and just go fake and load on the sunscreen (50-60 spf). I'm happy to say that I look 10 yrs younger than my actual age, if not more! This stuff is easy to apply, no raunchy stench, and does not feel sticky after it has dried...what could be better! Go get some of this!!"
251764,1,"I think this is a nice product. Long lasting, smells natural, leaves skin feeling nice."
88534,2,"I have always loved Jean Nate after bath splash. It's so refreshing particularly in the summertime. I had read some of the reviews saying the formula had changed, but couldn't think of a good alternative so I went ahead and ordered some. The other reviewers are absolutely right - the formula has changed! I still had a little bit of the ""old"" Jean Nate in a travel bottle and compared. The new stuff doesn't even smell remotely like the true original Jean Nate. I'm giving it two stars because there is one good quality that remains - when you splash it on it does feel cool (although I imagine rubbing alcohol, which smells as good as this stuff, would work as well and cost a lot less). I just can't understand why Revlon would change what was once a fantastic product, but I do know I'm now on the hunt for an alternative that smells decent."
208846,1,Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft. And a nice glow to boot. I use it about once a week to deeply cleanse my skin. It last for quite a while which helps with the high price
123247,2,"I'm not a big fan of this product. I love the ""smoky eyes"" look so I thought this product would be exactly what I need. I could barely tell I had it on, which was not the look I was going for. It also smeared a little too much without giving me the look that I wanted. With so many eyeliners on the market, including others from Avon, I wouldn't put this product on my ""must get"" list. However, to be fair, I only tried it in the black so if you are using another color, you probably will want a softer expression - meaning you notice the color without REALLY NOTICING the color. In that case it may work well for you."
228357,0,"Well I was actually expecting a potent scent, but apparently this is not that strong. I am not happy with this purchase"
159476,2,"I used this product for two days and I woke up to a swollen, bumpy, burning skin. Day two still the same, a little less burn. I will never use anything like this again or anything from this company. I look terrible and feel awful."
165187,0,"I have the purple ceramic tourmaline Hot Tools curling iron that is also 1 1/2"" and I loved it, but the springs wore out and I threw away my extra springs that came with it... So I bought this one because it was a little cheaper... It works well, but I am very long, very thick hair, and the ceramic curling iron works SO much better! Much better hold than this gold plated one. I suggest spending just a little more and getting the ceramic one! :)"
182774,0,i think it's a nice clipper but not a great one. it still leaves very sharp edges after cutting so i am not very satisfied with this product.
29339,0,"I like this perfume. Not typically attracted to very flowery or strong scents, I was looking for something a bit different and thought this might the answer. It is nice, but not a favorite.The good: it is musky, more mellow a scent. So, if you like that - this perfume might be for you. It is light and doesn't overpower, but still has a nice linger. It also does not smell like ""old lady perfume"" (per my sister). It has a more earthy quality that smells more natural than other store-perfumes (if that makes sense)To consider: if I were to give an untried smell description it would be: light notes of flower (like a cross b/w a lilac and daffodil - delicate but with substance), a somewhat soapy mid-tone, followed by a nice woodsy base note. For me, the slightly soapy smell - not bad, necessarily, but I just couldn't shake the association - made it fall into the 'nice but not favorite' category. Overall, I like it and wear it upon occasion (probably more in the summer) but not something I love enough to wear daily."
134443,1,"My father is on oxygen 24/7. Oxygen make skin dry and very rough. With this lotion his skin is now smooth, pink, and no longer itchy! It's been a lifesaver for him!"
116022,0,The picture shows a bottle and that's what I thought I was ordering but I received a tube. Not happy about that. I needed it urgently so did not bother complaining (earlier) or returning.
170752,1,The colour was a little duller than expected but then I noticed it really does match the Tiffany and Co. boxes. This nail polish is great quality and applies smoothly and beautifully.
86384,0,"I purchases this for myself to help me stop biting my nails. It does taste very bad, so it prevents me from mindlessly gnawing away while studying. The main downside is that you have to eat and if you touch your food with this on then your food will taste bad too. Even if you're not digging around in your food or licking your fingers, for some reason the bad taste doesn't seem to restrict itself to my fingernail where I painted it on. For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing? b/c I was very careful when they were wet) and this transfers to food. I finally gave up using it because I became so frustrated trying to eat and prepare meals without making things taste poisonous. I was pretty careful to let them dry thoroughly and not touch them when wet but somehow the taste still was all over my fingers."
187654,2,"Large pink circle scratches off with finger nail but when bought from salon, it doesn't scratch off. Eventually after use, all labels will come off. I believe the product is a fake."
149231,1,"This was a gift for my nephew. It was very nice, very roomy, and I was able to stock it with many toiletries. Strong and sturdy. Well made."
184449,1,It seems to be working. My only problem is that it is really thick and blue so I'm discouraged from applying it throughout my thick curly hair.
80247,0,"this shampoo leaves my hair too soft and strips it of body. Would be great for dry, brittle hair because it really softens and leaves hair with a great shine. I can use it every 2 or 3 times that I shampoo."
143514,0,"It comes down to personal preference. I had a cheap traditional style cuticle nipper that the spring kept thwacking me on the knuckle. Really annoying. So I thought this would be perfect - no spring, ergonomic fit, but I don't like the way it fits in my hand. It's plenty sharp, but I have this fear that its too easy to get carried away or careless and I'll snip off more than I should. So I'll have to purchase another (better quality) traditional style cuticle nipper and put this one in the spare bathroom for emergency/guest use."
222336,0,I admit that it was the Indian/Yoga marketing theme of this line that sold me. I'm really into that stuff but I wish I hadn't bought a whole bottle of this lotion: you might as well apply straight self-tanner and get in the tanning bed because that's what you will smell like when you get out.California Tan is a decent brand. Not as nice as Designer Skin or Swedish Beauty but better than most. I don't know what they did wrong here but most bronzing tanning lotions do not smell as much like self-tanner as this one does.I also dislike the consistency: it's very runny.
166660,1,This hand cream is very good but not worth the price. The tube is expensive and runs out fairly quickly.
45705,0,"Love the scent, unfortunately the scent doesn't last more than an hour. Try something else"
20551,0,"I gave this gift to my cousin who was going away to college. I sent it directly to her house gift wrapped. When she opened the box, my aunt told me that it smelled like motor oil. Everything in the box had a little bit of grease on it. We haven't figured out where it came from except that there is a multi-head screwdriver in the box that was a little greasy. Good stuff inside...however...something stinks!"
143731,0,"It's an unusual scent, something you are not going to meet at the mass fragrance production, even though I was expecting something more magic and sophisticated.The top notes are perfect, pink pepper well balanced with bergamot and cardamom which mellow the sour notes.After one hour, I can smell only pepper and cinnamon.Not a bad scent but I was expecting something more.Longevity and silage are moderate and the odor stays close to your skin with discretion.Not a bad choice though it's unique, dark and spicy. Compare to the price, it's a big dilemma"
213384,0,"I'm sure this is an excellent product. It is the only cream endorsed by the Le Leche League. I used it religiously when I was at the hospital after I had my son for my sore and cracked nipples. I was a confused when my diligent efforts didn't produce healing. I talked to the nurse about it. She observed my breastfeeding techniques multiple times stating that I was doing everything correctly. Then she asked me an interesting question,""Are you allergic to wool?"" Yes I am! This product contains lanolin, a product of wool. For most, it works wonders healing sore nipples; however, the more I put on, the worse I got. So, avoid the blisters on the nipples by skipping this product if you're allergic to wool!"
212808,1,"I love the body lotion, it is fantastic and I find that the scent last for hours. I get lots of compliments when I use it. I can really recommend this product. It is a classic scent that never goes out of style. I love it!!"
55821,0,I bought this because it was a great price even though I had no idea what it smelled like. I gave it to my sister who smokes because the scent has a smokey tone to it.
135801,0,So far so good. Only used it a few weeks so far. I can see a difference in thickness and some new hairs growing. Only down side is the oil smell.
188226,0,"I agree with the others who say it's not like it used to be. Doesn't get as hot! Not a high quality product! The on/off push button has not worked on the last 2 I bought. I usually end up taping it to the high position. The black tip often wobbles. What a shame someone had to ""dumb it down"" in order to make a bigger profit."
65290,0,"It does straighten my hair with a sheen, but I feel like it takes a bit longer to straighten with it and it pinches my hair at the ends instead of allowing my to glide from top to bottom. Good for price, but I think I should have opted for another one."
38146,1,"I can't find this perfume in any stores anymore, so I was thrilled to find it with you! I have tried others, but ALWAYS go back to this one. Love the smell! I will buy again soon!"
3001,2,"bulky, bulgy, hard to pack. it looked like a good idea, but this is really hard to deal with if you frequently travel light. by the way, it's hard to hang, too."
167936,1,This has been such a great product for the skin. This is one of three in our home...they are easy to keep clean and do a fantastic job at keeping the skin exfoliated and healthier looking.
1219,2,"I bought this from a vendor posted on amazon.com and tried the April Shower APHH handheld shower head...not so good.Pros: (one) no more metallic taste/feeling. My water's harness is 50 and it seemed to take care of that.Cons: 1) Like some other handheld shower heads, the head itself is too high and can't really be adjusted for (which is the basis for many of it's problems). 2) Because it's so high, it's spot is out of standard, so the water stream is almost hitting the far wall, can't be adjusted! 3) Because it's so high, I can't easily reach for the thing to use the handheld feature. I have to play with the hose to knock the head loose. 4) My hair is no softer, it's gotten worse. How can I describe hair that I would not want to touch after using conditioner? It's horrible. 5) My skin and my husband's skin is really dry now. He uses head and shoulders and I didn't know he needed it until now; talk about flaking. Also, I am more itchy than ever after using this shower head. 6) The settings are few and not flexible; there is circular, massage, combo and some other setting I don't use. The combo should have worked, instead I see an arc of water, very wimpy, it should be shooting out strait, but isn't. 7) if not for the issue about power/strength of water, I would say that the design of the handle along with the coupler lacked any reasonable planning of any kind. If I had designed it, I would have made darn sure that the head height was to standard, not made to fit a hose/coupler that would work with ANY shower head.High hopes, poor overall design (because I'm not planning on remodeling my shower around this shower head) = not usable or practical. Pass. I'm waiting to hear back from the vendor I bought this from regarding return. Will keep you posted in comments."
241818,0,"The booties are only good if you're willing to just lie around and do nothing because they're so cumbersome/heavy (with top and bottom heat packs) and no elastic around the ankle to keep them up at all so you can't get up to do anything. Heat is nice but definitely doesn't last long, in my experience. I think $ would be better spent buying an electric throw."
110518,0,"I don't think I'd buy this shampoo again even though it lathers nicely and smells very good. I found that I needed to use a conditioner. I also had to use a detangler to get my hair combed out and my hair seemed to be dry after using this product. I've used worse shampoos and the price was great, but there are too many others that I like better to choose from."
31684,2,"This stuff stings when I put it on my face. (No problem for arms, shoulders etc.) My wife has no problem with it at all. Everytime my kids put it on, I ask them if it stings and they agree with me that it does. I have better luck with the Hawaiian Tropic with Parsol."
194394,0,"The perfume is exactly what my wife wanted, but the top leaks. She's tried everything to make it stop, but it can't be helped."
157779,2,"I just bought a can of this ""unscented"" hair spray only to take it home, look at the ingredients list, and discover that ""fragrance"" is one of the ingredients. When I buy unscented items, I expect them to be unscented, not full of a stinky fragrance that will set off my allergies."
245645,1,Worked very well to help get rid of my bumps on my arms good packing and arrived on time would recommend to others
18145,1,This is the best hair brush that I have ever used. I will be order more of these at a later date.
84895,0,"This product worked somewhat but nowhere near did it eliminate my acne. I have also tried many other acne medications over the years (I'm 26 now) and while it wasn't the worse I've tried, it certainly isn't the best. One thing I will give it credit for is lack of side effects. I did not experience any dryness, pealing, nothing crazy like that.But like I said, it only took care of the problem slightly. I have learned that for some things, products made specifically for females tend to work better. Don't ask me why but women's deodorant works ten times better than the best males deodorant I ever used. I will use my girlfriend's deodorant and not sweat at all versus when I use my own, it just doesn't work as good. The same goes for acne medication. I have been usingNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser, 6.7-Ounceand100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oilfor the past couple months.I have the type of skin that breaks out very easily, something I've been dealing with since middle school. I don't know if you would call these items women's products, but they work better than anything I've ever used on my face. I would not have thought putting a minty smelling oil on my face would make such a difference, but I'm telling you it freakin works. I have never had this clear of skin in my life, period. I recommend looking into a fragance and oil free face wash and a tea tree oil of some sorts. Literally night and day when i look at my face now."
144191,0,Color perfect but difficult to find the right amt of liquid to make it apply properly. Cheaper brands seem to apply with just a little dab of moisture on brush. Don't think I'll get it again.
12643,2,"I purchased it to use as a moisturizer and light hair gel since it got great reviews for that type of usage. Unfortunately it does almost nothing for my curls and it often flakes underneath my makeup. Honestly, I never use it anymore. It sits in my bathroom untouched and nearly full. Will never buy again."
113150,0,"I bought this straightener May 2006 and it is still working. I reasearched different straighteners for a long time and finally decided on the Solia.Before I had a Vidal Sassoon straightener, and it would take me about 1 hour and 30 minutes to straighten my hair. I have very, very thick, wavy hair and when I purchased this straightener I was under the impression that if you had very thick hair it would make your hair appear thinner and less fat. This is not true. My hair gets definitely straight in about 30 minutes. But my hair still appears very thick.When I bought this and received this product, I didn't use any product. That was a mistake. From the get go you shouold use products like:Chi 44 Iron GuardNexxuz Heat Protexx HAet Styling SprayThermasilk straight and smooth styling creamThese products work very, very well to protect your hair against heat styling damage. Hope this review is helpful to you!OVERALLthis is a very good straightener and it definitely straightens but it won't make your hair appear less fat and invasive. BE SURE TO USE PRODUCTS WITH THIS STRAIGHTENER"
81522,0,I had remembered this cologne from a very long time ago and wanted to see if I still liked it. It was okay but not the knock-out fragrance that I had remembered and loved so well.
86916,0,"I guess if you have really sensitive skin, this would be good. However, it just doesn't get rid of enough oil (and help prevent as many ingrown hairs - i'm a guy) as the Neutrogena &#34;Clean Pore Oil Eliminating Astringent&#34; . It's also almost twice the price as aforementioned product. Unless you have an aversion to alcohol in the product, go with the alternative I listed."
163629,2,"Glytone used to be a great product line (silver jars). This is a ""new and improved"" product (white jars). It rolls off the skin and cracks it insted of smoothing it. I will be switching to another line."
2261,1,"my friend recommended it to me, and i tried it although it is very expensive just for a facial cleanser, the result is I LIKE IT A LOT! it is so gentle while cleaning your face. its worth the money,"
151441,1,"I've tried several by now and this is and will remain my top choice. It smells so beautiful and clean, softens my hair and is the best I've found at keeping my blonde highlights blonde since my hair is very fond of turning red and brassy. The Pantene one is also very good and smells great, softens great too, but the Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo works the best.FYI: There is one called Shimmer Lights, and it is awful and a waste of money so avoid it. It smells bad, the shampoo dries hair out to the texture of dried up hay and the conditioner is actually worse than the shampoo at conditioning. It stains everything it touches and leaves a weird shade on blonde hair. Get the Jhirmack!!"
86357,0,"I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter, I figured it was worth a try. I applied it to both of her thumbs and let them dry. She touched her thumbs to her other fingers. She put her fingers in her mouth and started gagging. I kept telling her to keep her fingers out, and she would be OK. Then, she threw up. About 15 minutes later, it happened again. This product seems to be very powerful, and I really felt bad after using it, since it caused her to vomit twice. I don't know how many more times it would have happened had I not removed the product. It seems to work, but with serious consequences for us..."
174768,0,"I bought a T3 tourmaline dryer a while ago from Amazon and quickly found out that the seller (folica.com) is not an authorized dealer for T3 dryers and do not come with a manufacturers warranty. I returned the dryer thinking I could find something else down the road, and I saw this one for much less. I thought that since it had ""tourmaline"" in it, it would work pretty much the same as the T3. Needless to say, it didn't work any better than my old ceramic con air. So, if you're expecting this dryer to perform like a tourmaline/ceramic/ionic hair dryer, think again. Good for the money, but not spectacular."
145896,0,"I have not tested it for traveling yet. I purchased it, because I needed one that would be compact for traveling. It is bigger than I thought it would be, but the fold up handle is nice. It is very durable feeling. I do not like that it is sooo loud. It was suppose to be less noise. I do like the ions feature. It does seem to make my hair shiny and give it more body. Even though it is less heat than my other blow dryer, it blows your hair dry fast and probably with less damage due to the ions."
188443,0,"Sent the wrong size. I paid for the larger. Tried to rectify. Again, the wrong size. Good communication. Packaging was fine."
21674,2,"As I mentioned with the other Zoya color, Regean, this color is nice, but it's not OPI! They lack shine and consistency. The product started out okay, but I found that the more I exposed the brush to the air, the polish started to thicken and clump. It's added to the polish trash pile!"
156761,0,I fell in love with this color when I saw it and I was so excited to try it. I absolutely love the color but I agree with the people who said that it goes on too thinly. It also has no gloss or shine to it whatsoever and imperfections are so visible! I am tempted to mix some clear sparkle polish into it or something to thicken it up and make it better. Not the best polish by China Glaze.
33825,1,"Have tried almost everything out there and on both ends of the price spectrum. Industrial Strength Hand Healer does what it says. Winter months are especially tough on my hands (cracking, rough dry skin) and this product delivers. Non greasy, and soaks in quickly. Smoothed the rough skin and took care of the dry spots. works well on elbows and feet as well. Highly recommend this product."
146916,0,"I tried this shampoo on my son for some cradle cap and dry scalp. It has some ingredients that help, although ultimately we still had to go to the dermatologist. Also, unfortunately the fragrance in this product can be potentially irritating to a baby with baby eczema. I tend to think hypoallergenic means free and clear of fragrance, but this shampoo does include fragrance."
65557,1,"get metal thermal model which works great and endures with actual usage. (all plastic/rubber model falls to pieces)Company delivered quickly and at good value when I ordered, though now preferred thermal model is not currently available..."
134975,1,"Hello,I have been using this perfume for at least 4 years, and guess what! I am not tired of it, everybody love it!!!!I feel so fresh...100% recommended!"
222222,0,"This is an OK shampoo but doesn't thicken fine hair any better than cheaper, drug store shampoos. Also the directions say to use a small amount as it is supposed to lather up with less . . . not so! I also got a couple other B&B products for fine, limp hair and they aren't any better than the shampoo. In my opinion none of them were worth the high prices."
135311,0,"This soap has a baby powder smell to it, which I don't mind. The problem is how strong the smell is - I could smell it standing a few feet away before even opening the packing box. Since I can't vouch for the quality of the soap, I'm giving it 3 stars."
104104,0,"This product arrived 3 days later than it was supposed to, I cannot comment on the product itself because it was a gift to someone."
208351,2,I ordered this for my kids as a fathers day present and when he opened the box there was only the small bottle of Joop. I am very disappointed that I did not get what I ordered!!
98869,2,"i expected to receive the same soap and packaging that they show. instead i got the new soap from ivory that anyone can buy at any store. they pulled a fast one on me. DO NOT BUY getting the old original soap is impossible, so do not waste your money."
61071,2,"It is doesn't smell at all, i bought this oil by mistake and i don't understand for what i paid such money"
161880,0,"I've used this product for several years, and it does a good job. However, I do not believe the results justify the excessive price that is charged."
220156,0,"I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.It is meh...ok. The bristles are very thin and not strong. I imagine that they will break soon. It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.There are a series of brushes that are all the same brush here on Amazon - I purchased several at the same time, and they are identical except for the branding."
20307,0,"Bought this today for my oldest daughter's b-day in March she will be 21 yrs old. She loves Clinique Happy & rarely buys it for herself since its pretty spendy, I found this at Marshalls here in Oregon, as part of a gift set with a 1.0 oz spray along with a body lotion for $22.99, it's not quite so powdery/fruity as the original Happy. I like it better we will see if she agrees, Clinique produces Happy Heart, original Happy, & this version Happy to Be. It's not my favorite perfume, but my daughter really likes Clinique perfume,if you like a lighter, younger scent, I think you will like it. Update 02/12/07 well she didn't wait for her b-day but the good news she loves it even better than the original Happy, she says it has a more perfume smell & is a more mature scent than Happy, whatever that means, hope that helps anyone choosing this perfume."
44111,1,"I am a Clinique fan. Bought this after reading reviews on so many different sites. I had severe acne on my chicks and Joe line and didn't wanted to buy a whole skincare kit. After using this product for more than two months my acne are completely gone. But I still have dark spots left from acne scar. This products makes skin feel very dry and itchy. Also It burned quite a bit, when I applied it on pimples.I don't have experience with any other products for acne. So I will use it again and recommend it, But I will also try to find something better and cheaper."
214640,0,"This mirror is just so so; good for the price, though. Magification is there but you have to be extremely close. There is clear focus in the center, but distortion at the edges. It is only 3"" diameter - good for travel but a bit small for everyday home use - I wish they offered a mirror with similar magnification that had a 1"" to 2"" larger diameter."
44453,1,"I bought this in the Opera color, and wore it to work yesterday for the first time. I got so many compliments on it, and had several people ask me where I got it. It's such a unique piece, and really does make your hair fall in a pretty cascade.What I also loved about it is that it helps your pony tail stay in place, with no slipping! I have thick hair that is very fine, and when I wear a pony tail with a rubber band-like holder, I ended up fighting with the holder all day. Not so with this France Luxe piece -- it held my hair, was comfortable, and didn't tug.France Luxe pieces are expensive, but you get a quality product that will last for years. This was a great purchase!"
63055,0,"I have foot problems for many years and am very athletic. Bunions are par for the course. This walkfit has its good and bad. I can understand what some people are saying when they state, ""they hurt"".Pros: it is hard plastic and won't give in after prolonged use, meaning continual arch support, unlike foam counterparts that don't support after extended walking or activities. I find them ok only for minimal walking or hiking activities, best for me in an ankle boot like a hiker with a soft foam pad over them.Cons: because it is hard plastic, I notice after several hours of walking(ie, being a tourist) they really hurt! It is like they are a fist pushing into your arch. I had to go buy some cheap foam arches at walgreens on one trip to replace the walk-fits, though the cheap foam arches gave no support(how can foam ever support an adult?). It helps to put a soft foot foam pad over them.Because they aren't really custom for the 4 arches in the foot, just that one long arch with the multiple sized inserts, its still a stock item, and its hit or miss whom they may help. its best to buy them from a retailer that takes returns if they don't work out for you, but they may. you don't know till you try."
33043,1,"I LOVE THIS SCENT. I am so glad they still make this wonderful perfume. It smell the same as it did in the 1940's. It is wonderful, last a long time on your skin and just smells wonderful. Unlike todays perfumes that smell like well, BUG SPRAY."
33609,0,"This is my least-favorite of the Elizabeth Taylor collection of fragrances. At first whiff, this perfume has a rather bitter, medicinal scent which I do not care for. However, it eventually mellows out as you wear it, and becomes more pleasant.I don't hate it, and I still wear it occasionally, but I wouldn't re-purchase. There is something too ""sharp"" or sour about the scent.On the other hand, I absolutely ADORE Elizabeth Taylor's ""Passion"", which is a much more complex fragrance that is sweet, spicy, and powdery all at once, without the oddly bitter note of this one."
146599,0,I have wavy hair and this is ok. It seems to weigh my hair down and not provide volume. I followed the directions and tried applying it several ways and it still seems to weigh my hari down.
247599,0,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.
239322,0,"Let me start off by saying that as far as scents go, one could do a lot worse. Lucky #6 isn't a perfume that packs a lot of punch as far as originality goes but if my choice is smelling like a sewer or like Liz Claiborne's unfortunately named fragrance, than I wouldn't mind spritzing this on my flesh. When I picked up the bottle I originally thought that this wasn't horrible, it was actually a quite pleasant, woody, oriental. I thought that I was lucky to have stumbled upon such a cheap but pleasant fragrance. It does have some staying power for a cheaper brand so if you're looking for some bang for your buck, Claiborne is your girl.The problem? The dry down on my skin was horrible. I kept smelling butter the entire day and it wasn't until I sniffed my pulse points that I realized that it was this fragrance. Now, I didn't down vote this for that reason but you know how some people claim some fragrances just don't work with their body chemistry? I didn't believe it until I got this. This fragrance went from 'ok' to 'did I just rub country crock on my body?"" Again, this is purely my experience with my skin but be wary of how it might react with your own body. I can't even explain how it changed scents to go from one extreme to another but it did not wear well on me."
114855,2,"I purchased a case of bumble and bumble products through Amazon. Not only was it shipped in shoddy newspaper, but the contents of the Bumble & Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner smell and feel NOTHING like that which I buy from Bumble and Bumble in NY. It makes me wonder if someone in the middle isn't messing with the contents. I tried contacting Amazon to complain, with no luck. I recommend buying from a salon that you know and trust as the product (when you're actually getting the true contents) is a fine product - 5* in my opinion."
100603,2,The first time I used this fragrance it made me nauseous. It had an old lady smell to it. I didn't smell any sandalwood at all. Very disappointed. I threw it away!
109522,2,"I am constantly looking for powder liners that give a smokey effect. So, when I heard that revlon came out with this in a ""limited edition"" form I purchased every color they made! Now I have all the colors that I cannot use. All the product does is go all over your face. Mind you the powder is quite indelible. When you try to wipe it off it just smears all over. If you do decide to try this don't try it out when you are in a hurry because you will have a BIG MESS!"
170376,2,I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase.
23033,2,"I have oily, oily, oily skin. I would wash my face with this scrub, go to bed and then wake-up and my face would be extremely oily. It's like my oily glands went into overdrive. I didn't notice any of the skin brightening claims. The only thing I love about this product is the smell. I love the smell and that's it!"
238446,2,"I wanted to get it because of the great reviews about it, but after using it for few months now I can tell you that it's not better than any oil that moisturizes your skin like baby oil or organic coconut oil which I use now on my face and everywhere and loving it because my skin drinks it very quickly so it vanishes in no time. As for the Marcuja oil, it is very light but it's hard to distribute evenly and then it just sits on the skin. It does moisturize, it has no smell which is good, it didn't cause any irritation nor caused my skin to break out. I now have this brown plastic bottle under the sink and I use it on my body honestly just because I have it and it's a shame to pay 40 something dollars and then not use it. In short, I didn't notice anything about it that makes it a great moisturizer and I recommend you spend 40 dollars on something else."
121785,2,"it never came after going back and forth for 4 weeks, they said it got sent back... whatever.. I got the money back so it's all good. I do not recommend this company"
97636,2,"I have worn this fragrance exclusively for many years and am VERY DISAPPOINTED! I was surprised when I opened the box as the packaging appeared drastically different from the usual Lacoste packaging... but thought perhaps just the packaging had changed as the box had all the usual Lacoste Pour Femme logos. NOT THE CASE!! The fragrance is terrible! Unless you want to smell like ALCOHOL and rosebuds... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I would return it if i could, but FRAGRANCE IS CONSIDERED A HAZARDOUS LIQUID PER AMAZON RETURNS AND IS NON-RETURNABLE! I am stuck with two bottles of this repulsive scent."
102598,1,This shampoo leaves hair clean with no residue and gives hair a nice feel and shine
160233,1,"Like some of the other reviewers stated, as a female it's not at all acceptable to have thinning hair, it really does cause a loss of confidence. I'm in my early 30's and have thinning hair with balding spots along my part. This product works! It covers up very well, no smell, not messy and you don't have to use a lot. I agree that it does come off on your fingers if you rub your scalp(maybe more so for me since I have an oily scalp)and it's pricey, but for me it's worth it...been using it for a few years, it certainly makes fixing my hair in the morning less stressful!"
50038,2,"I gave this product 30 days. It has a nice fragrance and feels good. However, I see no visible difference from other creams of this type that I have used over the years. Also, it advertised ""high levels of DMAE"". Would like to know exactly where in the list of ingredients DMAE falls?????"
189269,1,"I loved this EDT when I got it a few years ago and snapped it up at the current price.The smell is fairly light with a hint of (lemon)citrus which fades to a (cinnamon/clove) spice, which is not overwhelming. The smell lasts well and makes a good work fragrance where you want to smell good without overpowering your co-workers and clients."
103407,2,This product makes my skin extremely itchy! The electrodes themselves work better! Don't waste your money. Just my opinion.
85955,1,I am on my second bottle of this to get my 4 year daughter to stop thumb sucking! I put it on when she is sleeping. LOVE IT!!! if you get it on your own fingers you will taste the bitter too. but who cares! she hasn't sucked her thumb in almost a month. i am scared to stop using it.
144127,1,"This product is worth every cent. I have tried a few set in powders, but never had one with such great results. This powder really sets in the foundation, not letting it rub off and the skin feels really smooth. I know it sounds too good, but nothing like giving it a try."
29178,1,"Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess is an earthy musk and a great signature scent. I have been using this for years and it is not diluted like other egyptian musks I have purchased. It's a constant, great product."
95416,0,"I was dissapointed with the purchase.It wasn't original, watery and the color is different than the original.I won't suggest people to buy it from this site."
54906,0,The gel does not really make much soap suds. It seem more like a lotion instead of a shower gel..
240046,1,"I own the older version also, which is not digital. I bought the S-2004 about 5 years ago and it it works as great now as it did then. My 15-yr old daughter began straigtening her hair a few months ago, so I purchased another brand for her. She always came back to borrow mine, so I ended up giving her mine with the intention of buying a new straightening iron for me. I had purchased (and returned) 3 others, but they all pinched my fried & frizzy(from coloring), thick, long hair. My daughter's hair is very long as well, and this works great for both of us. So I had to go and buy this one. The other reviewers are correct, this thing gets HOT. I set it to 360(only the 2nd or 3rd setting). There is no way anybody would want it hotter than that. I LOVE this straightener! It never pinches my hair, my hair simply glides through the plates. I hold a brush in front of the plates while straightening bcz certain parts of my hair are frizzy, but my daughter doesn't; either way it performs outstanding. The plates are rounded, so I do a little flip on the ends at the same time I straighten the rest. I really do not know how anyone cannot love this straightener. The 3 straighteners that I tried were all more expensive-and they could not compare. All straighteners should have woven teflon on the plates. I agree that the buttons are not thoughtfully placed. However, for those ppl who have problems with the buttons: Hold the decrease temperature button (-) for appx 3 seconds to lock the temperature. Hold the power button for 3 seconds to shut the unit off."
144196,2,The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire it just says Dunhill Desire. the fragrance does not last longer.
85517,1,"I was amazed that it smelled so good, pleasant and not overbearing and everyone complimented me on it. Its a great moisturizer and yes, a little goes a long way. I like the fact that this was made with natural ingredients. My hair didn't feel greasy or weighed down. My friends (both black and white) loved it too. Its great to put on you hair before it is flat ironed. I'd buy this product again."
144174,0,"I have oily skin and I break out very easily. I started to use the 3 steps of the Shiseido Pureness line (Cleansing Foam, Balancing Softener and Matifying Moisturizer) and my skins appearance improved a lot. The Cleansing Foam is a key step for this ""matifying treatment"". I used it by day and night, but after one month of using it on a regular basis, my skin began to felt sticky and thick, specialy the T zone (forehead, nose and chin), like if my pores were getting clogged. I stopped using the Shiseido Cleasing Foam and I went back using my Clinique Face Wash (my skin doesn't feel thick and sticky anymore). I have to say that this foam is really good, my skin feels clean and fresh when I use it, but dont use it on a regular basis, only every 2 or 3 days, or if I have an special ocasion when I want my face to really look matte."
128460,2,It doesn't cover anything and it leaves hair full of gunk. I've used other stuff that works but this isn't one of them.
202497,0,i was fairly happy with this product - the color is very close to my natural lid color so it doesn't show as much as i had hoped but it still lends a pretty sparkle
40191,1,"I've only ever used cheap ones before. They work, but holy cow, they don't work nearly as well as this. Do yourself a favor and get these. You have no idea what you're missing out on."
66420,0,"This takes time to heat up and the switch is easy to shut off inadvertantly while using. However, it is a fair price and came quickly. Just not an enthusiastic yes!"
139284,2,I purchased this product to use with the tanning bed and a couple hours after use I broke out into a rash. I do get a nice tan with this product but I have to take a shower right after the tanning bed which is a pain if you have plans afterwards. If you are able to use self tanners regularly than you will be fine with this product and get great results. If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to have to shower right after use.
136587,0,"I got this to replace expensive dermalogica toners and expected it to work just as well. It kinda doesn't. Its fresh feeling and smells light and clean. But it doesn't keep my skin soft enough to clean blackheads away. I've noticed dermalogica toner after useage, keeps the skin soft enough to keep it clean while exfoliating and daily cleansing. Its good enough for after the shower or cleaning to keep you moist, but thats about it."
200408,1,That is..&#34;a little dab will do ya&#34;. This sure does the trick. And not at all hard on the hands as I expected a pumice product to be.
194498,0,Edited - the seller refunded my purchase due to Amazon's mistake of uploading the wrong picture.I'm disappointed in this purchase. The color shown is a bright pink but the actual color is a bright coral/sherbert orange color. The seller must have uploaded the wrong photo. When I Googled the color I did find the orange color. I won't lose sleep over $5 nail polish but will be more careful in the future in trusting the seller having the correct color displayed.
9883,2,"You wouldn't think that an expensive baby skin product would contain cancer causing substances, but this does! It was a gift from good friends and used it for a week before reading all the ingredients. I was moderately satisfied until that point - OK cleansing power, interesting light foam, nice fragrance. Too bad about the toxic ingredients."
18767,1,This product shipped quickly and was just in time for some stressful days. Every time I put this lotion on I feel a little bit more calm and collected. It's non-greasy and lasts for awhile. It keeps skin soothed and soft.
90664,2,"To be very honest, I would have no idea if the product its self is a good product or not, because the selling description with it, was not made clear enough for a man shopping for a woman, this item is not complete, and needs an additional product in order to be used. Enlarge of the presented photo also did nothing towards making that clear for the consumer. Bascially my family member, has an item that can't be used unless or untill we can find the other part needed to complete use of this item. My advise is, and suggestion, is to be able to ask a question of the seller of the item's for more complete information. Just my honest opinion."
206440,1,"I like the texture and color of this blush. It's very light and easy to blend, and doesn't look clownish. For extra staying power I would dust on a powder blush on top."
59510,1,"Still good stuff but it does seem to be a little watered down from the last time I bought it. The thickness of the stuff is definately lighter than before. Still smells the same, and still has fantastic organic ingredients, but its watery."
231147,0,Definitely one of the more effective pedicure tools I've owned although still takes a little more time than I'd like to remove the dead skin and smooth. Would be great if the tool has a little more power.
163086,1,"Bring a little bling in your life with this fragrance from one of my favorite designers Kimora Lee Simmons!Recently this September, I went to Robinsons-May with my mom,my grandmother and my brother.I came to get the Baby Phat Goddess perfume.I had $40.00 for the perfume.It smelled good.So ladies wherever you go,wear your Baby Phat perfume.I recommend this only for girls and ladies."
119484,1,"My husband and I were a little skeptical at first... could these two little balls really replace dryer sheets? And so far, so good... no static and no more need for dryer sheets.... gatta be way better for the environment and our pocketbook these days!"
136117,0,"Its thick, and a bit oily. Could not use it as hand cream since I work in gloves. Do use it when i give myself a manicure, and the scent is not too overwhelming."
235496,0,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with Clairol hair color -- however, I ordered the color Rosewood. I've used it before and really like the shade. What I got was Dark Auburn Brown -- which is something totally different. It's also a good color -- so I kept it -- but was disappointed that the wrong thing was sent to me."
120121,0,"Many people have told me that this oil can be used to grow hair so I bought it and I haven't seen any of that. However it does leave my hair extremely soft with no buildup. I have 4b African American hair, the roughest of rough, and when I hot comb my hair the oil adds an even softer touch to it. As for skin I suppose it would be best to add after baths. I use this because my hands get so dry that the skin breaks and cracks and bleeds. It does not get rid of the problem and only mildly helps it feel/get better. I believe it would be best if I mixed this with something else. Yes the smell is slightly overpowering. You can mix it with essential oils if you'd like. It's not that bad but I can see where it would be a problem. Overall it does get your hair soft and if you have mild to slightly dry skin it'd work great. It only worked ok on my extremely dry skin."
100787,0,"Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it. Its a tad thick for my taste but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application."
229045,0,"This cologne is not really the real jean paul gaultier but its a replica of it. Which who ever that did the replica, did it well. I own myself a bottle le male but it was almost over so i decided to come to amazon to get one. It was 55 dollars which was not bad at all compared to the one i bought at macys 85dollars. Basically, the cane did not have a serial number but the bottle did, which was odd. The writting of Gaultier on the back of the bottle was completely different from the original da i own. The smell is almost the same but it doesnt last couple hours but the real &#34;le male&#34; does.And to finish, If you plan to buy it from amazon llc, remember that you can not return this item because they know it is a replica."
2789,0,"May be its a Cologne, that's why its not long lasting but I expected it to be long lasting expecting its more than average price compare to other cologne.I just love smell but I wish if it stays more than 2 hours on my cloths"
144980,2,Ordinarily I like L'oreal hair color but the box of hair color sent to me looked like it had been on their storage shelf for many years and was outdated as far as coverage for grey hair. Shirley
206809,0,"My husband just want to surprise me (and he did) sending me this but I NEED to complain about the pump tube!!! it throws the cologne not ""spray"" it!!! it is very annoing and I just got it!! so it's NEW!!!I had this perfume before (well, not from Amazon) and I never knew it could happen, it is more like a water gun then a perfume spray... how can I ask for another spray (pump tube) or send it back... Amazon says is harzadous and non-returnable!!!"
31975,2,I only used this for two days as instructed the skin on my cheeks and around my nose is scaley and dry now from useing this product. If you have oily skin i think it would work well but everyone else RUN.
74509,0,"when I received this package, about 1/4 of it had leaked out into the package. its a good product. I just wish the company had of secured the bottle more to keep it from leaking."
27925,0,"I did not know how it smelled, but was curious to find out - so I got it. I relied on reviews, hoping that the smell would be ""soft, powdery and floral"" - i like powdery smells, that create a warm aura of luxury around you, but I think this aroma is a bit too spicy to be called soft, and a bit too bitter to be called floral. I smell the powdery notes, but they are not very pronounced and dissapear from my skin sooner then the ""peppery"" notes. I think that it's a great smell for those ladies that prefer classical and strict aromas (like my mom used to), but I still give it a ""3"" because it does not stay on long."
80840,0,"this is a lovely line of fragrances - each is subtle and appealing. I bought a this scent in june '09 - and unfortunately, by november '09, it has altered and become 'soapy'. so, i think either the shelf-life is nil, or the product was old when i got it. i've never had an oil-based scent turn so quickly.the packaging is adorable - the scent was pleasantly powdery before it went bad. it isn't cheap, so i wish it had lasted."
18288,1,Love this color. I wear it everyday. My nails are short and this color looks good. OPI seems to chip easily - only con.
83,2,"I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
244168,2,I bought this product by error thinking that it was the 24 oz bottle this one is too expensive.
201611,0,"Essie has some very beautiful colors, but all the nailpolishes have formaldehyde. There are other brands that also have pretty colors and are Big 3 free. Would not recommend this product. 3 stars for the color selection."
187748,1,"This is such an amazing color forEveryday wear or a French manicure, so nice that I ALWAYS get compliments on the color even from the folks at the nail salon doing my nails. I wear this color all year long."
100413,0,"The color wasn't what I expected, it was actually a dark purple. It doesn't glide on too easily either."
224657,1,It works well on both wet and dry hair very well. It was a great purchase. I recommend this product.
41331,0,"I found this to be particularly good for my sometimes overly sensitive skin, though I did find it a bit drying. However, it was non-irritating. It wasn't especially good at removing make-up and I found I needed a makeup remover first, followed by the soap."
70531,1,"This stuff works. I wouldn't actually call the scent that it has ""fresh"" as much as I would ""chemical,"" but it doesn't make your hair smell bad."
54683,1,I've used this product for years. Nice leave-in conditioner and best product to give body to your curls. Hairstyle lasts for days!
49325,2,"I have been using this product, following the instructions faithfully, for approx. 3 weeks and my nails are still splitting, peeling and breaking. Absolutely no improvement - a waste of time and money."
192281,0,"Canus Goat's Milk Fragrance Free Bar Soap, Five-Ounce Bars in 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)I was surprised that this soap smells so much like a goat and could not imagine using it with that smell. Luckily the longer it is out of the box the more the smell lessens but does not go away completely. So I started using it sparingly and have not had the goat smell linger on my skin. It sudses nicely and softens the skin. This is not enough reason for me to purchase it again. I wonder if the fragranced bar has a better smell to it."
148289,0,"I just got done with my first treatment, and I have to say, I'm disappointed, although I do see some improvement.What I Liked:The crystals (""Step 1"") have a pleasant orangey smell, as other reviewers have noted.The combination did seem to do a pretty good deep-cleaning of pores.My skin was softer afterwards.My skin also seemed brighter.Nonetheless, I'm disappointed. The product promises ""diminishing fine lines"" and this did not happen. Also, it does feel as if the process stirred things up a bit, in that I have certain tell-take signs that I didn't have before use of an imminent breakout.If they offered a money-back guarantee, I would take it."
14715,1,"My sister paid almost $200 for her flat iron. I couldnt see myself doing that. When I saw this one on Amazon, I was hesitant to buy it. It looks just like my sisters $200 flat iron, but would it perform the same way? I took a chance anyway and ordered it and found there is no difference. Except the price of course. The main feature I love about the ceramic hot irons is that you dont burn yourself or your hair like you would with a regular curling iron. And styling your hair is easier and faster. I Love it! Glad I purchased it."
250150,1,"I bought this as a gift for my sister and she really likes it. She is an aspiring makeup artist so she uses it quite a bit. She said the only downside is that the light adjustment dial is pretty hard to slide back and fourth. Other than that it's a cool mirror, it even has a power outlet on the mirror for hair straighteners or whatever you feel like plugging into it."
160081,2,"The jury is still out...This is my second bottle of Ethnic Grow hair supplements, and I have not seen enough credible growth to post an honest review.

132417,0,Well this is good if you have small and light black heads and you have to probably finish the whole pack to get rid of your black heads on your nose. It is really pulling them out without pain or anything but make sure to use it after shower.

5253,1,"I am in love with this product! I have always hated using foundation, but powders never had the coverage I needed. The first time I tried Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals, it looked terrible. But after a little practice, it is by far, the best foundation I have ever used. I have very blotchy skin, with dark red patches and acne scars. This product gives me the flawless skin nature didn't!I have tried several of the competitor's products that claim to be mineral foundation, but none of them worked as well as the Bare Escentuals. In fact, none of them worked at all for me!Be sure to follow the Swirl, Tap, Buff instructions, or it will not work right! I have also learned that using lotions of any kind before this product, will cause clumping in that area. I use Mineral Veil before the foundation when I have recently used lotion, or need extra coverage.EDITED 6 months later - December 30, 2009I have since stopped using this product, but still stand behind this review. I have battled cystic acne and acne vulgaris for 20 years or more (NOT caused, or even aggravated by this product). I have some signifigant scarring as a result of this. As my skin has aged, the scarring has become more noticeable. The Bare Minerals powder worked great to cover the redness of these scars. But since the surface of my face is no longer perfectly smooth due to these scars, the powder actually makes them MORE noticeable. I was very sad to give this product up, and I still think longingly of it while slathering on my goopy foundation.So basically, Bare Minerals is wonderful, and I still highly recommend it. But if you have pits from severe acne scarring, it may not be the product for you."

80522,1,"I have struggled with dandruff my entire life. Only two kinds of products have worked for me. The coal tar shampoos and Sebulex. In the winter my dry scalp flairs up really bad, it's like I have an itchy, oily/dry crust all over my head. I used this shampoo 3 times and it cleared everything right up. I followed the directions and left it on for a bit after I lathered up. I did not repeat as the directions said to. I think I will be able to use it just twice a week to maintain. It's not as smelly as the coal tar (my husband refuses to shower after me when I use coal tar shampoo), and my hair doesn't seem to be damaged at all. Great product!"

120825,0,"After one year of use, this brush did not perform the way it should have and i had to throw it out. It IS a good brush, but the pins could not hold up to the maintenance of my combination 3C-4B natural afro-textured hair. The middle pins slowly sunk into the cushion to the point where pulling them back out what useless. I also noticed that when i brushed through my moisturized, air-dried hair, single strands of my curly/kinky hair would wrap around the ball end pins and cause breakage. I would say this happened to about 4-6 strands a brushing, which doesn't seem like much. But consider daily use. For someone adamant about retaining length, this creates roadblocks. Also, the pins are actually two parts: one long flexible plastic piece with a ball end and a short bit of plastic about 1/3 of the size of the whole pin. At times, my hair would get snagged between these two pieces, snapping strands close to the root (strand count unknown). There's a chance that these snagging issues could be eased by generously coating hair with a preferred hair mask or conditioner, but the brush cushion is very hard to clean (and it holds moisture). This brush is gentle enough not to create too much unnecessary shedding and was a decent detangling tool (I'd say the best I've found SO FAR brush wise...), but the design has flaws that lead me to keep searching for the perfect brush."
88854,0,"She liked it but complained that without the curved tip that the Definicils pro has, the application was more difficult. She was able to get used to it however and the mascara itself still works fine. Just getting accustomed to the different brush without a curve that fits your eyelashes was just slightly annoying she said."
75580,0,"There is nothing remotely similar to the sweet and delicate smell of gardenias in this perfume. It's not a bad fragrance, not at all, it's just that it definitely has the strong and heady smell of jasmine and the title of 'Gardenia' is very misleading. This would be a nice fragrance to wear in the summer, as it's a very clean and brisk smell, but be warned that if you are a fan of the beautiful scent of gardenias, this is not the perfume to get. As far as I know, the only perfume currently available that captures a true gardenia smell is 'Island Gardenia' from Jovan/Coty."
44211,2,"I had bought the chamomile version of this soap a year ago and liked it very much. I recently bought the fragrance free pure olive oil soap. It was a lot ""greener"" than the first bar I had purchased. This stuff is caustic. It is very drying and irritating to the skin, very unlike my previous experience with the product. I feel as if the soap was not properly cured leaving some of the lye viable, I don't know. But the product is unusable."
217109,0,"This is a great color - I have a hard time finding it in stores. Only CVS seems to have the Ash Brown. Walgreens, Rite Aide, Target, Safeway -- none of them carry the ash brown - at least none of the stores near me. The price on Amazon was about $1 cheaper per box than what CVS's regular price is. This is a good color - the ""ash"" in the brown helps make the color look more realistic than the medium or light brown colors. Problem is that within a week, I see gray strands popping up on the sides and top of my head. Ideally, I'd have to use this product every two weeks to stay on top of the gray. I use a shampoo that is formulated for color treated hair, but even still, the color just doesn't last anywhere near what they say it should."

15258,1,"I bought this years ago at a dept store for my husband and he loved it. It's a light citrus scent and smells yummy! After a few years I could no longer find it in stores, so I searched online and it popped up on Amazon! Yea! Just gave it to him for his bday and he was all excited to have it again. Now I know I can always find it here : )"
210872,0,I'm not really a big fan of this perfume. The only reason I got it is bc my husband really likes it on me.
137406,2,I do absolutely LOVE this color...but I found out the hard way that China Glaze chip SUPER fast. I guess I will stick to OPI!
151784,0,It's a pretty colour until you spend too much time out in the sun. The sun completely obliterated the colour from my hair.
181355,0,"Works okay. Just wish I got the one that had a separate switch for the heat and speed. This one only has high heat on the high speed, which is very loud. Other than that, it's a good hair dryer. Kids like that it is lightweight. Nightlight is a joke though.As of December, although been doing this for about 2 months now, the hair dryer puts off a spark when the switch is flipped and it starts off real slow and slowly builds up speed. Sometimes it never gets back up to full speed. Big piece of junk!!!!!!My previous wall-mounted hair dryer was a Sunbeam that I bought at Phar Mor about 15 years ago, before it finally died."
231365,0,"A little strong smelling but nice. Doesn't smell anything like Burberry which is more of a softer scent which I prefer more than Burberry London. I have tried Burberry Brit and Burberry. Prefer in this order Burberry, Burberry Brit and London last."
182226,2,"The color is nice,But it comes off so easily,For me I like the polish to stay on good at least two days before rubbing off or chipping..This just doesn't last"
223065,1,"You gotta wear Patchoulyto get it. It is one of the most striking, strong scents there is. It is very sensual and deep,and it is not for everyone. It is one of these things you either love or hate. People have very fervant feelings about patchouly. This particularly brand is pure. It lingers yet it is not too overpowering and there is none of that synthetic overkill. It is a good brand. I have purchased better, but this one is more subtle than those and it is not always polite to push the scent you wear on others. I hete perfume and gag when women wear too much."
195120,1,"Mania by Armani is by far my favorite cologne. It is subtle enough for most situations (office, meetings, etc.), and it really performs when you need to impress. Very masculine... I've got nothing but compliments. It's a must buy for those who want that added edge when a woman gets nice and close."

212141,1,This cologne smells great very woodsy and spicy. It is a great cologne for men and a great price. Love it
141748,1,"This is a lovely conditioner. It has a very nice, thick, creamy, and smooth texture. But it is not heavy or greasy.For my wavy/curly hair, the best thing for it is to wet it, load it up with conditioner, and comb it with a wide tooth comb before rinsing the conditioner out. With silicone-free products, it can be a challenge to find a conditioner that has the right consistency to aid in the combing of wet, unruly hair. Sometimes they can be downright awful. This conditioner allowed my comb to slip easily through my hair, no tangles or snarls, I was quite impressed.As the other commenter noted, this conditioner is virtually scent-free. There is a *very* mild scent, but I really had to sniff hard to notice it. This is good for me, because I'm prone to fragrance-triggered headaches.It left my hair light, soft, and shiny, though with a bit more fly-aways than usual. Finger-combing some coconut oil into my hair solved that easily enough.This will be in the running to keep as a daily conditioner. So far it's in my personal Top 3."
76508,1,Revlon discontinued a lipstick I liked/lovely color and sheen .......the seller sent the lipsticks quickly and in fine order and I was happy to have my favorite color for a while longer. HAPPY I THOUGHT TO LOOK ON AMAZON. Thank you.

221272,0,My daughter has horrible Eczema. After reading some of the reviews I decided to try this cream. At first it seemed to help but it was very short lived. Not that impressed with the product.
227080,1,"I've been searching high and low for a dark caffeine color for a while now, something with a splash of red. Although I found many deep reds, none of them met my requirements. Finally, I narrowed it down to this, and Essie Wicked. Well, I'm certainly glad I went for Mrs. O'Leary's because this shade is gorgeous! It's not a cranberry red, but isn't a maroon either. It's dark and complex, changing from burgundy in the sunlight, to a dark purple from afar, and brown under low light. My only complaint is that the polish is a little thick. Since it is very opaque I barely needed two coats, but it was difficult to apply and dragged a lot, most likely because the formula is a bit old. Nevertheless, I'm going to be wearing this as much as possible before the spring comes! Highly recommend this."
28290,2,"I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!"
158836,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
119654,1,The facial steamer delivers amazing results. My face glows every time I use it. I would recommend it to those who want an affordable facial steamer.
242163,0,I would expect to recieve a guide handle (metlal rod with small bend at end) with the purchase of a new stone. The new sets you sell have a place to add stones as well as a guide rod. No guide rod sent with new stones just isn't fare!
13854,2,This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying. This may be good for other people but not for me.
245986,0,"This product is pretty good stuff, but steer clear of it if you break out easily. It made me break out all the time I've been using it. I didn't know where the sudden extra breakouts came from, so I switched foundations, powders, even cleansers. It turned out it was this - iy heavily clogged my pores and caused alot of unusual breakouts. It's good for skin that barely ever breaks out - it moisturizes and protects great though."
77687,2,"This lipgloss tasted and smelled terrible...like melted plastic. As much as I enjoy Nars products, I don't recommend this gloss to anyone. Try MAC or Lancome or Revlon. This lipgloss was revolting."
35542,0,"This is the first of the philosophy bath products I have tried. I wanted to use it mostly as a bubble bath. For the money, I am somewhat disappointed. The smell and bubbles were fine, but I expected more of a realistic strawberry smell for this much money. The smell had a slightly chemical/ plasticy element to it (like most fake fruit products smell). As a shampoo, it seemed fine, but nothing amazing for the money. As a shower gel, it again did the job, but I did not notice a particular difference in my skin from my normal moisturizing soap. Both as a gel and in the bath, the smell filled the bathroom. But, I did not notice it long afterwards either in the room or on my skin. All in all, an OK product, I guess I just expected more."
9788,1,Lotion works well and does not leave my face feeling greasy! Like that it has SPF in it for days when I'm outside. Fragrance free as well.
28964,0,"I finally ordered this product after being tempted for years based on its reviews. It is a nice fragrance - but it reminds me of another perfume ""Windsong"" (which is a lot cheaper)."
20616,2,"I ordered this kit for my girlfriend who has many tattoos. She was just hired for a sales position that would require her to cover her tats with clothing. She has a large chest piece and a large tattoo on her forearm. We bought this so she could wear a shirt other than a high collar or long sleeve. This product did not work for her at all. She applied the base and then 4 applications of the actual cover up and her arm tattoo was still completely visible, just slightly faded or less colorful. This did not cover the tattoo at all. And reading other reviews just to be clear, she is very experienced with makeup and is not user error. We were extremely hopeful this would allow her to use more of her clothes at work so tried several times to make this product work. It also rubbed off on her clothing. Basically this product did nothing it said it would. ALSO, even if the product would have worked, we paid $33.95 for the kit, and while it does come in a cool mini lunchbox, it is a SAMPLE kit. There is even a note inside that says ""We offer all our products in full sizes also!"" Really? 34 dollars for a sample kit that does not even work??? Trust me, move on to the next product. We are going to try something else, so save your money and skip this one."
43001,2,"I read the good reviews about this cologne and decided to get it for my husband as a gift. I never smelled the scent, so I was taking a chance. After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice. We thought maybe the smell would die down, so he went to work with it on. He said that people kept asking who was wearing cinnamon scented cologne while he was there. He knew it was him, but he didn't say anything...LOL! I don't like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum. I kept getting queasy, so we just decided to throw it away. Maybe his body chemistry just didn't go with it. Overall, If you like the smell of pumpkin pies on your skin, then I would suggest this. If not, do not buy this scent. And from now on when it comes to scents, I will have to sniff before buying."
59696,1,"I used to have dreadlocks and used this stuff every time I'd shower. My hair smelt (smelled?) great 100% of the time, and since tea tree oil is a natural fungicide, I didn't have to worry about anything growing in my dreads.As a matter of fact, I still have my dreads in a bag in my basement, and last time I opened it to look at them they STILL smelled great!Speaking of.. maybe I should toss those things out... one day."
85538,1,"I noticed a change already! Having natural hair isn't as hard as people say. You just have to stick with it and find the right product. I can't quite tell what type of hair I have, I know its in the 4 realm, but this made it super soft on the first try! I also purchased Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls and Hydrate My Curls. I used both last night and my curls are looking great!"
247688,1,"Finally, I found a good everyday colonge that last. The scent is light but noticable, pretty crisp and pleasent. Of couse the smell fades a bit by the end of the day, but it has lasted much longer than others I paid more for and I don't need to put a lot of it on.The exact same thing sold at the mall (the ones close to me anyway) sells between $25 and $30+ dollars so Amazon's deal is pretty good.For me it's the perfect everyday colonge."
170422,0,"I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
127239,0,to Start with the packing for this prodcut was horrible i got this one with a broken lid . Used this product for one and half weeks continously..nothing spcl just like normal water.. no improvement of skin.. however it might be useful on a suuny day ..for its price its too expensive .
54020,0,"These foam covered rollers give lots of shine and a softer curl than rigid plastic rollers. The 4 jumbo size are nice for longer hair, but there must have been a severe metal shortage when they designed the clips. It takes several tries to get the roller to stay in. If the clips were even 3/4 inch longer, they could grab enough hair to hold on, but these are frustrating. I'm looking for another option so I can use my nice rollers!"
161157,2,"I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews. Received dryer today. Pulled out cord. Pushed button to retract. Nothing. Tried to coax it back in and could only push it part way. Returning it to Amazon. And, am going to avoid Andis products. If they want to enter the low end market, they should make a product that works."
123254,2,"I had worn this color ( Saturn Grey once) when I was in my 20s and unless the formula has changed , I just didn't find it had a very good staying power. Nice colors thou. The idea of not having to sharpen was great but it does not last all day and it does bleed. I bought it once in my 20s and haven't bought it since.To me , color should last and I am talking more than an hour or 2. Try the Make-Up For Ever liners. They are awesome and boy do they stay."
207985,0,"This oil is very good for the scalp if you don't mind the distinct smell. It was not unpleasant, however, it lingered a bit. I use it for scalp massages."

162139,0,We've just installed the Andis model 33490 hard wired hair dryer as a replacement unit. Since it hasn't been used yet we don't know how well it will hold up but we hope that the unit has better cratsmanship than the installation hardware that came with the unit. The mounting hardware is very shoddy; amazingly crappy materials.

So when the DVD paused and asked me to review the workbook and answer questions, I was not able to do that. When I purchased the DVD I did not know that the workbook was required too. Although i appreciated the references to God and the Bible, I did think a wider audience could be reached without so many references. When viewing the DVD, I noticed I had to return to the main menu to continue. So it would be great if that annoying glitch could be fixed."

153725,2,"This product left my hair very dry after dying. The packets that came with the dye (shampoo and conditioner) were literally only enough for 1/4 of my hair. I would not recommend this hair dye. Creme of Nature products have something in them that leaves your hair more dry than if you did not use it and I am not sure what it is. The color was intense and what I expected (which is why I give 2 stars), but the quality of my hair after dying it was horrible. I had to co-wash my hair the same day to get some moisture back into it."
219412,0,The fragrance doesn't seem quite right. I have a little Escape left in another bottle that is almost empty. My old Escape seems stronger. I'm wondering if the bottle I just purchased was not stored properly and/or is really old and it lost strength.
140196,0,"I ordered this by mistake and would not recommend. It's so thin it runs out of the container without squeezing, like it was watered down."
12434,1,You will never want to leave your shower when you use this soap. It is the best smelling and invigorating soap I have ever used!
47900,1,This is not a pricy product but effective after using it. It smells good tho! And one thing that I feel a little bit unsatisfied is that it is not long lasting.
123437,2,"Sensitive skin may be a bit misleading. This has scent, freesia being one of them. For the allergy prone, it is a no go. Wish that it had stated it had scent in the description.NOTE to anyone ordering in California: UPS cannot deliver. As it is a liquid, something about hazardous material liquid(?) UPS delivers to the post office. Then the post office tries to deliver ONCE to you. Yeah. So be prepared to pick up at post office."
133567,1,The price is perfect. Why dont you make it in spray canister for a more even and more convenient application?
190609,2,"I would not recommend this one (NuSole Pedi Stone Pumice), it dissolved immediately in the water.....just like the evil witch of the west!"
200093,0,This isn't as powerfull as it appeared to be by reviews. Only slightly more power then othere Conair models and other similarly priced brands.
221819,0,"It is very good for the money it cost. I would buy again, but since I had a Chi before, I noticed the heating element doesn't heat up as much as the Chi did. But I was disappointed in how long my Chi lasted (only 2 years before it broke). So I would say this iron is worth the money and it straightens my hair just fine."
64109,1,"Beautiful fresh scent that is not overbearing, I always get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it out. Love it."
216041,1,I ordered this to apply to my work boots. Because of my job I work in a lot of different enviroments. It was easy to apply and was quite effective. Water just beads onto the boot and is easy to wipe down. Because of this product maintenance is minimal and its very effective. Any time I get a new pair of work boots I will definitely order this product again.
142945,0,"I had a bottle of the 1990's formula of this product and it was outstanding; it would take wrinkles out of linen shirt. Sadly,the new formula isn't as spactacular. But I have a plan: I will leave the cap off and let some of the fluid evaporate; this ought to bring the concentration closer to the original formula. Buy this stuff at your own risk. If you have trenches like I do, it may disappoint; if you are just starting to head South, this product may be just what you're looking for. It beats any cream out there and really does last as long as it claims (up to 8 hours)."
24539,2,"I wish I could review this, but I never received it. I think it would do a pretty decent job with exfoliating my skin....although, there have been a couple of AB Hydroxy acid products which caused little pimples (mulluscum?) on my skin"
251652,1,"This is unlike any perfume I ever smelled. Very distinct and unique scent.I associate it with color white,something crisp and clean."
115857,2,"I love these products...for what it is, I use it as a shower gel and the lather is great, doesn't dry me out. But I was excited for a Vanilla Cupcake sented experience... I was dissapointed. I would recommend the other products, the fruity ones, ice cream ones, Key Lime pie for sure..I would not buy this again for the smell."
4663,1,"I really like this make up and found it to be better shade and quality, with SPF, than what I could buy in the drugstore for the same price-because it came with two bottles, and I had never noticed it in store before.I am glad I tried it and will use Amazon.com next time I want cosmetics."
99613,2,"The only redeeming quality of this conditioner is the fresh lemon scent. This conditioner does nothing to condition your hair. It doesn't even help with detangling. In fact, my hair was less tangled when I completely skipped this conditioner and just used the coordinating shampoo. It might work for short hair that needs very little conditioning. I would steer clear."
185948,2,"I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but after 3 days of using it, I got bad breakouts all over my face. I normally have combination to oily skin, and this made my skin more oily. Disappointed."
180721,1,"This was purchased to replace a similar dryer that burnt out (as they all seem to do) after about five years. It's quite good, and somewhat quieter than my old Conair dryer with the same features and power. The attachments fit well and don't fall off or pop off and go careening across the room--always a plus!I've subtracted a star because of two drawbacks:- Every dryer this size should have a retractable cord, and this one doesn't. There's just no excuse any longer. I know--wrapping the cord around the handle won't make my arm fall off, but it's not as tidy as a retractable cord.- It overheats just a little bit too easily. After about three minutes on high, I have to hit the cool air button to bring the temp back down and reset the circuit that prevents the unit from overheating. The circuit resets very quickly, though--you have to run the unit on cool for only about five seconds.Overall, it's a good dryer. I definitely recommend it."
9614,1,"Very good shampoo, but I tried same brand of conditioner and didn't like it (but didn't keep it on my head for 1 hr as was recommended. I would recommend this shampoo to a friend."
133179,2,"I have always trusted Amazon to send me the best products so I was shocked to find that the cologne I purchased is rancid - it smells like chemicals (and not good Ones). There should be expiration dates on these products as this one must have expired a long time ago. Now I find I am unable to send it back because it is potentially hazardous or flammable. It seemed to be fine when Amazon mailed it to me but now it's dangerous for me to send it back. Since I didn't open the package for a week, I am past the ""time limit"" to get a refund. I never thought that I would need to smell the cologne right away in case they sent one that was rancid. I guess I better check everything as soon as I get it. In the mean time I have thrown $21 down the drain and will do my shopping for cologne elsewhere."
203871,0,"I bought this after reading reviews and seeing the infomercial. When I first used it it seemed to do wonders on my hair! I had beautiful, silky hair with volume for the first time in my life! I just had to make sure my hair was thoroughly rinsed or else I'd have build up. I wasn't crazy about the smell (like wet dog) but when it dried it didn't smell so bad. However, the next day my hair would be oddly stringy and matted so I'd have to ""wash"" my hair again.My hair is naturally straight, thick, and, well, Asian. I've never really had problems with it but I wanted something weightless to impart more volume while not sacrificing moisture. This seemed to do the trick...for awhile. After a few weeks I noticed it didn't do anything for my hair anymore, and my hair would feel greasy and gross the next day, so I decided to switch back to shampoo. I had some left so I used it again a few months later with horrible results! The smell is bad...really bad. And it doesn't give me shiny, voluminous, manageable hair. It looks dried out and almost frizzy - which usually never happens with my hair.I've given up on this product. My sis came to visit me and tried it out (also an infomercial-lover like myself) and HATED it. I don't think I'll buy this again."
29234,0,"This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like. It's very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me. When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time. It's not off putting, in fact it's a bit comforting. At this stage of my life however, I'd prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : ) Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well."
132398,2,This product was a fake I have used it for over 10 years and it is not the formula. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
106802,0,"If you want a women's fragrance is better to opt for one of Carolina Herrera (just personal opinion), this fragrance compared with men's version is worse."
203876,1,"So, to start off on some backround. I'm biracial-- half black and half white. My hair is really curly and frizzy, and was really long, a little over armpit length. So when it was straight it was mid-back. I used to straighten my hair a lot but for the past year I stopped, so it was still dry and brittle. Anyways when I first started using wen I loved it the first time. It defined my curls and didn't dry out my hair like shampoo--and the smell didn't really phase me too much. However my hair is really thick and before I cut it, very long!(And Wen only seemed to be making it longer) Wen was really expensive for me to keep up with. I was going through a 32 oz bottle in 3 weeks and that really added up. So I did research and found that Sally's Beauty Supply sold something similar called Hair One. It's basically the same thing but its only 12$. I used that for a few months until I got my hair cut, then I went back to Wen for a while. I didn't notice a difference between the Hair One and Wen except the numbers in my checkbook. Long story short if you can afford it then good for you. If you have damaged or frizzy hair, I think that this is worth a try."
173605,2,"Beauty encounters sent the wrong color I ordeded #265 and they would not exchange the unopened product for the right color and I could not prove it because they never sent me a confirmation e-mail. Which led me to believe they don't have it and it's still advertised. I got a RMA code to retun it, sent it back 6/21 was told there would be a 15% restock fee and still have not recieved a credit. I will never again do businees with them and have spread the word.Thx for inquiring, Alyson Tittman"
82274,0,"I've bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good. It's not the best that I've ever had, but works well for the price."
228796,2,"Save your money if you have dark brown hair. I bought the copper red and had to hold my hair to the light to see any hint of ""copper red"". I dyed a blonde swatch and the color turned a med brown red. So much for drama. This was using a 30 volume peroxide for 30 mins. No high-lift properties as advertised."
245425,0,"I liked the smell and feel of it when it was applied. I was a little careful as I am very fairskinned and allergic to a number of things, but this product didn't seem to bother my skin. I would recommend it to my family and friends and plan on continuing to use it."
59512,0,"If you are used to a sudsy soap, this is not for you. I like it, my husband doesn't for that very reason."
60385,1,I LOVE Essie! This is the greatest nail polish; I can get a full five+ days out of my manicure. This color is so great; it has a little shimmer to give some interest and dimension to red.
204261,2,"I used Just for Men beard and moustache dye for the past three years with no problem. Last week I dyed my beard and moustache and the next morning I had scarlet skin, oozing blisters that don't heal without seeing a dermatologist (even after a week). I work in the pharmaceutical industry and can't believe the FDA has approved this. I am send Just for Men a bill for my doctor's visits and prescriptions. II contacted them and they said nothing had changed and to do a skin test. I told them I had been using the product weekly for the past 2 years and now my skins explodes for no reason???? They are liars and they need to remove the product from the market before they physically scar someone. Somewhere there has to be a class action suit against them. Find it and sign up. WARNING- even if you have been using this product with no problem like me. It can happen to you. AND IT WON'T HEAL WITHOUT A DOCTORS HELP."
183703,0,"I think the almost-$40 for this dryer is over-priced. The feature set and the quality really don't justify paying more than half that. I have an old one that I think I got at Target for about $20 and I got this as a replacement because I doubt that old one's gonna last a lot longer. I still use the old one! I'm thinking about putting this on eBay. If I can get half what I paid, I'm ordering one much less costly."
4739,1,"This barrette is very cute and it came in lovely packaging. However, I feel that the price is a bit high considering its overall quality."
243862,0,"Originally I was worried about allergy. I have to say this treatment may be too mild to me. It works, not significantly.Also I found this is NOT transparent gel, but some white cream which does not fully absorbs, and leads to an ugly face white white spots."
235224,1,"I saw a review on this foundation, some negative, but ... I bought mine and for me it and her perfect.In coverage , smell, texture and durability...I'm in love!Thanks!"
244149,1,It's great to be able to order my favorite soap--I'm allergic to most others--on-line.I wasn't able to find the soap bars anywhere in my area and was frustrated. So I'm very pleased with my ability to find the product through Amazon.com.
195563,0,"...you might love that. Depends on how much you adore the scent of real rose petals (quality roses, not the seemingly fragrance free cheaper ones).I will say that for me, hands down, the best of the Les BAins Du Marais oils and scents is the MUSC BLANC. Wow, it's such a lovely, gentle, clean, pretty white musk, and I adore musk. But I got the set with the Rose Confiture (soap, gel, oil, scent spray), and despite not having alcohol, the eau de soin really has scent. Unfortunately, it started giving me a headache. It really is a genuinely rose scent, a pure and pretty scent, but it did not agree with my head.I guess I can only take rose scent in smaller doses (like the hint of it in the Musc Blanc).But if you go gaga for roses, unadulterated roses, baby, this is for you."
201191,0,I just had my toe digits done and was a little disappointed. The Pink look in the bottle is not what landed on my toes. More of a beigy look. Can anyone suggest a another color for me. I tried Vanity too and the same thing.
199594,0,"Shipping on this 2 oz. product was $6.50, wiping out the savings on the price of the product. At least I didn't have to shop for it."
51317,1,"Great product, had some trouble locating this product but after searching for awhile I discovered that Amazon had it I was happy. It was great service and fast shipping, I have not complaints at all."
105715,2,"Professional hairstylist who previously used CHI and Paul Mitchell flatirons. Researched the FHI Irons extensively prior to purchase, and I am slightly disappointed. Rated low due to iron breaking within 30 days of purchase and not able to use wet to dry, like indicated on packaging. While in use, gives off strange fumes that create irritation of eyes and throat. Total waste of money. Not better than the CHI."
128957,1,I love the Aloe Body Butter from the Body Shop. I am starting on my second container and it is absolutely wonderful. I even use it on my face as a moisturizer under my foundation makeup. This is absolutely the best cream I have ever found for dry skin.
26537,0,As soon as I got the replacement filters for my showerhead the showerhead broke. The plastic broke off where it screws to the hose. So the filters are useless to me
40473,1,Very happy with the service. Fast transaction - and got the item for much less than I would in the store. Thanks!
221705,1,I have use white diamonds for 15 yrs and still love it. I really love the price on this as I have paid $45.00 at walmart. Would certainly recommend to a friend.
76829,0,"I love this color. It's a beautiful cross between pink, purple and brown. The lip gloss isn't long wearing meaning you have to reapply every hour or 2. Also, the tube leaks. You will have to constantly wipe off the screw top - if you don't your purse will be covered in lip gloss. As much as I love this color, it's expensive, it makes a mess and isn't long wearing. I made the switch to Smashbox Limitless lipgloss in the color ""endless"". The lip gloss is long wearing, doesn't make a less and is the same price as the NARS."
142984,0,This is a product that I usually buy in smaller amounts at the store. Buying online in this gallon size was a good buy. Just wish it would have come with a pump and that it didn't have a sort of 'sour odor' that I haven't noticed from this product from my in-store purchases.
236977,1,"I'm over 40 and have struggled with acne since I was 12. I've been on everything from antibiotics to accutane. I've tried every wash and acne system sold out there and this is the ONLY thing that has never let me down. Just a dab on a pimple and in 1-2 days it's gone. You look a little goofy with it on, but that's not so bad. I'd rather look goofy while I'm sleeping than the creature from the black lagoon when I'm awake and in public. I love this stuff and am just sad that I can no longer find it at the drug store. Please, PLEASE (!!!) do not stop selling it here."
85077,0,I found this item to be so-so. I barely ever use it. The handle moves pivots a bit causing me to turn myself frequently. I haven't found anything as reliable as the old fashioned hot comb and oven...
181816,0,I fell in love with this color when I saw it and I was so excited to try it. I absolutely love the color but I agree with the people who said that it goes on too thinly. It also has no gloss or shine to it whatsoever and imperfections are so visible! I am tempted to mix some clear sparkle polish into it or something to thicken it up and make it better. Not the best polish by China Glaze.
171263,2,"Read all reviews hoping this would be for me but it isn't. I applied with light thistle brush and it enhanced every pore on my face. The color was dull, got the medium natural. It appeared greyish in color. The one positive, it felt like nothing but I did break out badly from this powder. Since I stopped using it, my breakouts are healing.I have used them all, high priced dept stores, drug store...pretty much MANY brands. I gave up and I ran errands at target and picked up the maybelline mousse foundation. I couldn't believe it, but this stuff was a perfect match to my skin, so light and doesn't come off. $7 go figure."
121664,0,"Note that this brush is very, very soft. Too soft for me to find useful at all."
147608,0,It gets to a certain temperature and cuts off. Does not fully dry all hair. Will probably sell this dryer and get a hard shell if I can find one.
160307,2,i purchased the sea sponge and i was not happy with the size it is very very small.the sponge after several usage it falls apart it is not worth the price.
35672,1,Casn't but these where I'm living. Just the right product for living in a volcano zone
125819,1,"I used to own Mason Pearson brush for many years till recently it mysteriously disappeared. I was looking to buy another, but they are so expensive so I decided to look for a close alternative. And let me tell you - this is it. To my opinion this brush is just like Mason Pearson or just as good, just for a fraction of a price. Thinking of the brushes I just can't justify a brush for $100+. No offense Mason Pearson."
83185,0,"My daugher's dentist put some of this on her nail in the hopes that it would be too bitter to bear. It seemed to work which was good since this was a last resort. (The plastic thumb guard only lasted while she was asleep, but as soon as it came off, the thumb was back in the mouth.) However, the next time we tried it, she still sucked her thumb, claiming it didn't taste bad enough to deter her from sucking her thumb! Whatever."
16575,0,"I've been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo) for about a week now. I bought it because my hair was starting to feel dry and frizzy. The first time I used it, I was surprised at how thin it was, and I felt like I had to add more to my shoulder-length hair. It's definitely better than drugstore brands, but I wouldn't call it a miracle worker."
87340,1,"I bought this shampoo to help me with my dandruff since I heard that tea tree oil can help. Well I didn't see any difference after using this. Maybe this stuff isn't strong enough, I don't know. But this is pretty good for a normal shampoo. The price here on amazon is half of what they sell in the stores.I also like how few ingredients are in this shampoo. Before buying I read that some people didn't like the smell. I think it has a nice subtle smell too it. I'll probably buy it again.It doesn't lather too well the first time, but if you rinse and repeat, it will lather up well the second time."
60810,0,"Nice item, but a bit heavy for sleeping. I am sure it would work good for theraputic purposes, I did not use it. I am looking for something light for sleeping."
9934,2,"This creme has a nice smell, but it would be nice if it were more waxy. I find when it's in my hair, it takes my hair a long time to dry and kind of just smears around my little flyaways."
135074,0,"i really like these rollers and have a larger set for home use. purchased these for travel -- i travel for work several times a month and despite a good suitcase, the base, the lid, and most parts of the exterior break, crack, etc. this product needs a redesign for travel."
223734,0,"i normally like white diamonds product, but this one is not like my usual buy, have decide not to buy online the perfumes"
52184,0,This product makes your hair feel refreshed after a long week or styling and products. It felt like a nice Sunday hair soap that really got my hair free of impurities after I rinsed it. The shampoo reminded me of soap because it has a good amount of suds and smelled clean.
240370,0,"The mirror itself looks good but the light is really poor. Yes, it's soft but it's soft as a candle-light. Can you imagine doing make up by candle-light? So, if you need just a mirror this one is not bad, but if you need a GOOD LIGHTED mirror choose another one."
66043,0,"This works great, quick and easy to use. It is wider than most so you can do ""bigger"" groups of hair at a time. Love this product, in fact this is my second one purchase. The first one lasted less than 6 months, which shocked me, but I am hoping that was a fluke. The wiring started to short out. I use it on average 5 days a week on medium setting. I have had much cheaper ones last for years."
89786,0,This was not for me and my skin. I am starting to notice that ROC brand products does not work for me well. It tends to make me break out if it is for the face or make me red. And I don't have sensitive skin either. I am 31 with fair skin and I am indian. Hope that helps.
232162,1,"This was a perfect gift For my Husband, i Like how smell...it arrived on time and the box was close"
133541,0,"Product appears to be OK, but was poorly packaged and the boxes arrived badly dented. The bottles inside are OK, or at least the ones I have checked of the six in total in two separate boxes. I did contact the seller and heard NO response."
132685,0,"For some reason, these strips only grab the dirt and remove it from the pores at the sides of my nose (where my nose meets my face). I follow the directions exactly every time; not sure why. Not sure I would re-order this item."
238723,0,"Prompt delivery, however, I did not know that the cologne I bought was a tester bottle. Although it was still new and in packaging, it says tester bottle right on the box. It did not state anywhere in the ad that it was a tester. Other than that, overall everything was good."
53292,1,great product! the hair keeps the form during all day and even longer. flexible. need special shampoo though to wash it out (same manufacturer).
57673,0,I do notice a difference in my skin. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
189651,0,"It is ok. It feels really nice on your skin. I didn't notice the smell of the one I ordered, and it is not one of my favorite scents, but the cream feels good."
236784,2,I was disappointed with this product. It smells awful so I would definitely recommend using this only at night (and only if you're going to be alone). It also has a very low concentration of medicine (1%). I used this all over my face and then put the drying lotion on over it and it worked okay but I've used better.
112989,1,Just as it looks and doesn't wear off easily. Another great product from Cover Girl.
228318,0,"My latest obsession is with colognes and fragrances and I bought all 5 of the ones mentioned in ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon.com that was great, and others. They haven't all arrived yet ( darn it), but I have to say that this cologne is good- 3.5 stars. It's a brighter and more cheery scent (if there is such a thing) than Cool Water which is also pretty dern good, and less citrusy than Tommy. The price is pretty mid-range for the designer colognes that you might see at the mall."
159924,0,Product works but seems fragile and hallow. I wish the product I purchased was more sturdy rather than feeling like it will break off at any moment. My former brush was 5 years ago and feels more sturdier than this brush :(
119096,1,"bought this as a gift for wedding. Shipped directly to the newlyweds. Still friends with them, so must be good."
22220,0,I didnt like the thick way it went on or the way it peeled off The SAME day :( not happy with it
34049,0,"I originally purchased two shades of ammonia-free Herbatint (honey blonde and platinum blonde) to counteract effects of traditional hair color with ammonia, namely brittle hair. Being excited to find an ammonia-free product, I failed to recognize that there are still four other potential toxins in this product:1) Upon reading the label, I immediately noticed a high concentration of propylene glycol (second ingredient from the top). Propylene glycol is a cheap alternative to glycerin and is universally used in personal care products to keep products moist. However, propylene glycol is actually the active ingredient in antifreeze! It quickly penetrates the skin and can cause brain, liver and kidney abnormalities, as well as immunotoxicity, respiratory toxicity, and skin or sense organ toxicity. The EPA requires people who work with this substance to wear protective gear to avoid skin contact. One product rating site called GoodGuide has determined the use of propylene glycol in this product to be a medium-level threat.2) Another toxin found in both shades is p-phenylenediamine (PPD) which can cause neurotoxicity, as well as GI, liver, cardiovascular, blood and kidney toxicity. Use of this substance is restricted in Canada. This also has been determined by GoodGuide to be a medium-level threat in this product. Unfortunately, I have read that all permanent hair colors contain PPD, and the only thing one can really do to avoid it is to use a semi-permanent hair color which Herbatint also offers and is rated much higher.3) Sodium hydrosulfite, present in both shades, can cause skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation. Interestingly, the GoodGuide site lists sodium METABIsulfite as an ingredient in the above-mentioned shades of Herbatint hair color, again of medium concern. However, sodium HYDROsulfite is actually what is listed on the boxes I purchased. I wonder if perhaps Herbatint recently changed to a less irritating sulfite. In any case, either sulfite can cause irritation in susceptible individuals.4) Resorcinol is present in at least the honey blonde shade which has been shown to cause cardiovascular and blood toxicity, as well as endocrine disrupting effects.In light of the above, GoodGuide has given the Herbatint Permanent Haircolour Gel a rating of 2 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the most healthy and environmentally friendly. In addition, this product is on NO certification listings such as ""Safe Cosmetic Pledge,"" etc. As mentioned above, Herbatint does have other hair products that score higher.The above facts notwithstanding, I DO want to commend Herbatint for NOT using sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or isopropyl alcohol in their permanent hair color formulation. SLS is another cheap ingredient that is widely used in personal care products but is among the most irritating and dangerous, and isopropyl alcohol will actually dry hair and cause breakage.As far as relative ease of using the product, I experienced no major problems understanding the instructions or mixing the product. The main difficulty I encountered while applying the product was that the HUGE gloves provided made actual application somewhat awkward and cumbersome. I would advise anyone with small-to-medium hands to plan on using their own gloves.BOTTOM LINE: If you just want an ammonia-free product, this is for you! If, however, you are searching for a more ""natural"" product without potentially toxic or irritating ingredients, I would recommend searching for hair color without propylene glycol and other substances listed above. Such products DO exist, and I will be trying them next in my quest for a more natural product!"
92720,1,I have been using this lipstick for a long time. I love it. My favorite color is the pink lightning.
233796,1,"I bought this as a present for my GF, it does look like a very nice hair dryer. I have not used it, but wooden box was not in good shape when I received it. This was right before x-mas and i would have not got the return in time. Amazon was decent and gave me 10% off."
245601,2,"Due to budgetary constraints, I had to find a cheaper night cream. I'm 43 with combo, slightly sensitive skin that's blackhead-prone and subject to the occasional pimple. For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime. This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it's non-irritating (to me) and unscented. However, whether I apply a lot or a little, I wake up with extremely greasy skin that still feels somewhat dry and parched underneath, and the blackheads are worse. I'm guessing that sesame oil doesn't agree with me. It's hit or miss with natural oils--my face loves avocado and almond oils but olive and soybean oils make me break out. Your mileage may vary!I will be using this up on my neck and decollete, where it works beautifully--lovely glow and no greasiness--though n.b., I detect a slight scent of sesame oil under my turtlenecks and recommend you don't apply this under silk and dry-cleanables."
61048,2,"So, am I supposed to be pleased that I paid, in essence, five dollars a day for five days of service from this radio? The sound was decent; I was pleased with it for those five days. And then, I turned it on and NOTHING. Thought it was the batteries, so replaced them more than one time, but still NOTHING. My advice for prospective buyers: steer clear and move on from this one! I have mine in the box and ready to be mailed and returned."
189759,1,"I love this dryer. I have extremely thick, long hair which is a pain to blow dry. I got to the point where I would air dry my hair which left it frizzy and tangled. This dryer works wonders. It still takes a while to dry my hair - but that's because I don't use the high or high heat setting. It's compact size and light weight make blow drying less of a hassle. My hair has never looked better."
173779,0,"I've only ever used the Target-brand for cosmetic pads, which I have no complaints about, so I'm comparing this product to that. The Iris cosmetic pads are very soft, except that they shed little tufts of cotton on my face (which the Target-brand pads do not). So, they work fine, but it's annoying to have to brush off the left-behind cotton, especially if I forgot to do it immediately after using the pad and then put lotion or make-up on."
102200,0,"First and foremost, I'm a 24 year old female. I have had acne since I was 10 years old. I have legit tried every product out there with the exception of prescribed medications. I have had SOME success. Let me break this down.FACE: My face has a tendency to clear up for a few weeks and then breakout, out of seemingly nowhere. Doesn't matter what I eat, whether I take vitamins or not. My face is either smooth, or looks like the surface of the moon. During the summer months I use Clearasil Daily Scrub, because it lifts the oils without drying me out too much, and somehow doesn't irritate my skin. My facial skin seems to be allergic to most things so this came as a shock to me. During the winter months I usually mix Cetiphil Gentle Skin Cleanser with St Ives (or store brand) Apricot Scrub for all skin types. It exfoliates, cleanses, and leaves moisture which is awesome since every moisturizer i've ever used has made my face more shiny than a disco ball.BODY: My bacne is stubborn as hell. It comes in patches, not usually all over. It goes usually from my shoulders to the small of my back, occasionally on my sides. I assume that this is a combination of oil and sweat, and since like most people I wear shirts most of the day, it doesn't really have the opportunity to breathe and dry out. As far as body wash goes, every acne clearing body wash/scrub either makes me worse, or makes my already dry legs feel like alligator skin. I get so itchy, especially over the winter that I develop welts and so forth.. It's really a project to handle. A bar of cetiphil is really the only thing that doesnt kill me.REVIEW: Now, I have been using this for the 3 or 4 days that I've had it, and my face is most definitely allergic to it.. I break out not into new acne, but into allergy bumps WHILE IM IN THE SHOWER. While it does leave my face really clean, and after about 2 hours of sitting and waiting a bit smoother, I'm not sure that the itchy factor is worth it. As far as my body goes, this does NOT dry out my legs. In fact, it makes them less dry, so I'm happy about that. My back has been less red and irritated, and the size of the acne seems to be decreasing. It has not cleared up, but It's definitely looking and feeling better than it was. I will continue using this until the bar is done to see what happens, but I'm not confident that this is much better than my bar of cetiphil was and its twice as expensive."

16669,0,"Okay I love the fact that I can now buy great natural products, but c'mon what is with all these natural product becoming so...I don't know? Um... useless. I buy exclusively natural and chemical free cosmetics and I'm finding it harder and harder to find products that are reasonably priced they actually work. This is a RINSE not a wash. It doesn't lather hardly at all, which doesn't bother me as long as it's getting me clean. I don't work in a garage or anything I'm not covered in motor oil or anything like that, I'm just washing off the days dirt. This gel doesn't wash anything off and frankly the smell is...weird. Not sure why someone would think this smelled like honey or mango. It smells like sour bananas. The first time I used it I had to wash off the gel with something else...lol I love Alba and I suggest their products regularly but this one is not great."

They heat up fast (beware- I've burned myself a few times!) and keep the curl in my hair, all store bought ones could not do this! My hair stylist uses these brands. I have one and bought 3 more for my sister and nieces and they agree it's by far the best they have ever used. Just don't wind up the cord around the handle Bc it causes wear and tear over time and may break the wiring at the base of the handle."
169799,0,"I got this as my first razor about two years ago, and I do think it's a good first razor. But I have a few critiques:The razor cuts a few hairs every other pass. This problem existed to some degrees when I first got it, but is even worse now that two years have passed. It's not too durable.The razor is too easy to turn on. I took the Titanium 5100 with me on a trip, but apparently luggage had shifted around in the car and pushed the on button. The battery was dead when I got there. There isn't really a way to prevent this from happening.It's not clear if it's done charging. I can plug it in and I will always get the same indicator regardless of whether the razor is fully charged or not charged at all.It's a little noisy.It's a fair first razor, but I wouldn't trust it as anything more than that."

203803,0,"I had heard such rave reviews about this conditioner that I committed and bought the huge 32oz bottle. The first night I went to use it I was very excited about the transformation that was about to take place. Fast forward to my first pump. Holy...what?? This stuff smells exactly like Robitussion cough drops. Ick. Ok fast forward now to a couple weeks and a few uses later, yea it's a good product. I use the gazillion pumps it tells you to use and also use 1 pump as a leave-in and my hair needs absolutely no other product to look really great. I've gotten a few compliments on my hair since starting to use the product, in fact. But, really...Robitussin? I hate to think what this stuff smelled like before all the hours put in at the lab formulating a scent. Some other reviewer mentioned it has a ""natural"" scent. I'd say that's accurate if where you live the trees smell like cough drops and the grass like Vick's."
57199,0,"I enjoyed trying the Neutrogena Body Wash. It leaves your skin feeling clean but not dry. At first I thought the scent was refreshing and clean, but it can be a little overpowering for a body wash. I would use it every once in a while but to use it on a daily basis you'd have to really love the scent. Which I don't."

164287,2,I have had this curling brush for several years and I don't like it for a couple of reasons. 1. It doesn't have a cool tip. It's hard to hold the tip without your fingers feeling the heat. 2. The tip has a grove in it. If the grove lines up with one of the brushes the brush has a tendency to fall out. I had 1 to fall out and it ended up getting broken. Now I have one spot that is like a curling iron and I have a tendency to burn myself.

28605,0,"I received some Hope in a Jar as a part of a holiday gift set and thought it was perfect timing since I was running out of my usual moisturizer. It's listed as being for all skin types, I have dry skin and like my products rich and quenching. Normally I go straight for the dry prone products. I have been using Jar-O-Hope for a few weeks now. It was surprisingly fluffy. The cream has a whipped quality which gives it a light feathery feel when it's applied. It also has a slight iridescent sheen to the cream, barely noticeable against the winter white base but it gives your skin a nice fresh glow.When I first started using Hope in a Jar it really didn't help my parched skin especially in the seasonably colder climate. This would be better suited for someone like me with problematic dry skin to use in the summer. I stuck with it, and after a few applications and a hydrating booster from another brand my skin finally adjusted to it. Still I kind of lather it on which becomes a problem since it has an astringent scent to it that's quite strong and irritates my eyes.Overall this product gives skin a fresh matte look. It is light, airy, and probably best for normal skin types. I don't think it provides enough moisture by it's self for dryer skin suffers, and the strong scent is sure to irritate those with sensitive skin, eyes, and conditions like asthma and allergies."

118824,2,"I just ordered this product from another site and later found the reviews for it. they weren't very good. I will judge for myself, but I find it very suspicious that all of those who gave it 5 stars and rave reviews only have 5 stars to give every product they review. One has to wonder if different companies don't pay them to ""work from home"" to post nothing but great things about various products. Highly suspicious."
21697,0,"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it."

134104,0,"I have previously used a Chi hair straightener and a Hot Tools one. The Chi was a much better flat iron compared to the Hot Tools one as I did not feel my hair was damaged as much and was very easy to use. I purchased this (HAI) after reading several good reviews. Although this flat iron does straighten my hair, I feel that I need to go over the same area twice to get it very straight. I have thick hair, which is naturally almost straight but has a slight wave. I don't feel that any hair straightener should take more than one try to get my hair straight. So, given that this one is taking more time and effort than I would have expected, I would give it a 3 of 5."
220337,0,"It does detangle wet hair, but if your hair is long, thick and curly like mine, it takes quite a while to brush through all the tangles. Some tangles are too stubborn for this brush, and oftentimes I lose patience and end up just brushing my hair with a regular brush (when wet). This is a great brush for thinner hair that does not tangle easily. Great concept though; just didn't work wonders for me..."
85907,1,"I have an 11 year old son who is way beyond just nail biting and bites his fingers as well. He's been doing this a couple of years and really wants to stop, but has had a hard time and hasn't been able to. His fingers have been red from him biting the skin off. He's been complaining about it and saying he wants to stop because it hurts and it bugs him, but he can't. He would bite his fingers not just the tips around the nails, but down the sides as well. I was hoping this would not only help him to stop, but also not hurt him when I put it on!IT WAS GREAT! There wasn't any stinging when I applied it (obviously there weren't any open wounds!) and he did NOT like it! By the end of the day he was saying how horrible it was because it kept making everything taste awful. :) At dinner there was an added bonus of him not eating anything with his fingers (something we're always getting on him for! :)). 2-3 days later he still had a bit on him. I haven't reapplied it yet because he's set on not biting them so he doesn't have to have this on. I LOVE it and it was worth every cent!! :)"

It's great because unlike some of the pinkier shades, this one is very natural. It's not at all frosty, and it glides on very smoothly. I feel more dressed up with it on. It's shiny, has staying power (but not through a full meal), and a great deal when it's on sale. Overall a good quality product. I want to get more and wear them all the time."

But being a Dermalogica fan, when the bottle came I thought to give it a try anyway.This eye makeup remover is a disappointment and not suitable for the eye. Imagine slathering gelatinous goo on your eyes, then pouring buckets of tepid water onto them to rinse it off, so that you can open your eyes to see again. Yes, the product does remove eye makeup -- along with your eyesight, if you're not careful. The goo is not eye friendly and stings. The texture is also annoying for eye makeup, although I may be using too much (a dollop of goo will do). Would not recommend to friends, even die-hards of Dermalogica."

For comparison, I have a bottle of Zino that I bought in a department store about 7 years ago; and the new cologne that just arrived has a very similar fragrance, close enough to satisfy me. The bottle and packaging of the new product sure do look authentic, also, so I'm not sure how other customers are so sure this is a knockoff. One final note: I like the way the fragrance of the new cologne mellows on my skin some time after I've sprayed some on."

It faded in a few weeks, but I'm hesitant to re-dye because several shirts had dye rub off on the collar area and permanently stained. This happened to my shirts even two or three weeks after I had dyed, and washed my hair a few times, it still rubbed off on my shirts. I really wanted it to work, but it's not worth ruining my clothes. Now, I just use clip in purple hair extensions."

183701,1,"I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. For the past 3 years, I've been using this rinky dink Vidal Sassoon crappy hair dryer that was drying my scalp terribly. Although, my scalp is already dry as it is, that hair dryer wasn't helping. After adding this to my wish list and seeing that it had the constant price, I knew it wouldn't come down anymore. I didn't want to waste my money on another POS hair dryer, and then have to deal with the struggle of returning it. Let me tell you, this hair dryer is everything I want and need. It is a little on the heavy side, but with the soft plastic finish on the dryer, it's really not as bad as people make it out to be. It also has a removable filter for easy cleaning. How cool is that? It also has a cool shot button, a setting for Warm, Hot, and Cool. and another setting for speed. I find myself using the warm and lowest speed setting. That's really all you need since the dryer puts out a lot of force. Also, it comes with an attachment, which is exactly what I was looking for. It says that it eliminates frizz, however, I find that to be a little white lie. So, I use an anti-frizz by L'oreal for my dry ends. That seems to do the trick. I have medium length hair that is a tad bit on the thin side, instead of it taking 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, it now only takes 8 minutes. Minus the anti-frizz flaw, I love this dryer. If mine ever breaks, I'll be back to purchase another one. I've also used mine over a dozen times already, and haven't had a problem with it. I'm not sure why a lot of people are reporting theirs broke after the first or second time."

Inhaling the rich, sweet coconut milk scent of this shampoo reminds ms of a splendid, sunny day I spent on Waikiki, slathering Hawaiian Tropics all over my skin and thinking of absolutely nothing but the sun, sand, and surf. Everytime I lather this creamy, milky shampoo into my hair, I forget I am standing in a freezing bathroom in Alaska and slip into a delicious fantasy of me bathing in a waterfall in Kauai!There is one warning about this shampoo though: it cleanses your hair like a clarifying shampoo. It leaves your hair very clean but a tad on the dry side like when you use a clarifying shampoo. I use a great conditioner from Aveda - one that has a coconut, grapefruit scent and it works great."

However, for years, I used several different conditioners, with none of them working that great when it came to dry scalp. This one works - and it's rated highly for restoring moisture to follicles (I'm not saying it grows hair, just strengthens; however, my hair loss slowed quite a bit after finding this)."

249934,0,"3/5 stars for not doing anything amazing, but not ruining my hair either. Details below!If I had read the reviews for this product before I bought it, I probably wouldn't have. But, I had already picked out out from the store so I figured I would take my chances (the rest of the reviews I read elsewhere were 50/50).First off, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. They have a lot of dos and don'ts. This product DOES contain peroxide, so I made sure I followed the instructions exactly. If you have hair that is prone to turn brassy when lightened, maybe you shouldn't use this. I have thick, light brown hair that had not been colored, processed, etc. and don't know what other people have, or if that even makes a difference. I had not shampooed my hair for two days before I used this product. It goes on exactly like hair dye, even though the box says something about being used just like shampoo. I left it on for 10 minutes, like the box says.In the shower my hair did not feel frizzy, poofy, coarse, crunchy, or anything else. It felt normal. I got out of the shower, towel dried my hair some, and the blow-dried it. I couldn't tell if it had lightened some parts of my hair, or if I was just imagining things because I had read so many reviews about that problem. Either way, it's a few days later and I can't tell the difference. My hair looked shiny, but nothing out of a magazine or anything.It's almost a week later and while my hair still looks shiny, it doesn't make me want to stop at mirrors and admire it. So, again, three stars because I did not have problems with it but I don't think it's worth the price or the energy."

76404,0,"The Good:*It's REALLY fast (so fast that I sometimes end up with a weird cowlick or whatever because I didn't realize some of my hair was already dry and I'd missed the styling window)*It makes my hair even shinier than usual*Gets rid of frizzies pretty well as long as you don't hang out in the humid bathroom for too long*Requires less coordination than brush/dryer comboThe Bad:*It's VERY loud and high-pitched and I do have to dry the hair behind my ears, which means the noise is aimed right in my ear canal, and that ain't good (I put cotton balls in my ears before I turn the dryer on)*It blows my hair around so I don't have a lot of control over the end result of my efforts (to be honest with you I don't usually care that much)*It's a bit heavy, and because you use it like a brush, it gets really close to your head (which in my case means I crack myself in the head with it every few days)*The cord is too shortIt's worth a shot if you want a fast dryer. It takes me maybe 5 minutes to dry my shortish hair, and it used to take up to 10 with a standard drugstore hairdryer. I hate to think of people damaging their vulnerable ears with this thing though; hopefully I just got an abnormally noisy dryer."
150336,0,"These are the actual first ingredients of this conditioner:Aqua (Water)Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1)Behentrimonium ChlorideCetearyl AlcoholGlycerinStearyl AlcoholCetyl AlcoholIsopropyl AlcoholGlyceryl Stearate SEPolysorbate 60(essential oils come after this, which there are many, but obviously not in higher concentrations than the first ingredients)You will notice all of the cleansing (and stripping) ingredients in this conditioner. Basically, you don't even need to shampoo before using this product. Behentrimonium Chloride is irritating to the eyes at .1% and is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. It is a disinfectant and antistatic agent that is irritating to the skin, toxic and can be fatal if ingested (it is supposedly safe if less than 5% in a rinse off product). Beyond that, notice all of the alcohols which are drying, as well. I used this today as a cleansing conditioner between shampoos and still had to use several drops of oil to hydrate the ends of my hair. I really liked the older version which had more essential oils and less cleansing agents. The shampoo, which has also been reformulated, leaves my hair feeling and looking like straw. I really don't know what Avalon was thinking and definitely will not be repurchasing unless they switch to a more hair friendly formulation.Shampoo and conditioner purchased from naturally healthy concepts on sale for little over seven dollars a bottle with free shipping. A great, small and highly rated company that truly delivers."

I emailed them as instructed and never received an answer back from them. I will NEVER use this company again!"
243212,2,I bought this soap because I use to like the Garden Tomato soap that Burt's Bees made. This soap is definitely not as good as the Tomato one. I thought it was a pretty OK soap until I started having an allergic reaction to it. I wish the box it came on had the ingredients listed on it so I could figure out what's in it that I'm allergic to. It might be a good soap for other people with less sensitive skin.
18598,2,"I was really excited about getting this, it's a scent i remember with fondness from my earlier years and i was delighted to see that i could still get my hands on it. I got a shock when it arrived though.. it didn't smell anything like it i remembered, maybe it's just me but it had this weird smell to it like there was something else mixed in. can't stand the smell now and i think i""d be doing my fragrance purchases direct from the store where i cansmell it first.."
54875,2,"My brother ordered this off the internet for my mom for Christmas. The packaging was nearly identical, the bottle, the silver writing... everything looked VERY similar.But I have been wearing this perfume for two years now. The minute I even sprayed the bottle I could tell something was different. The spray was much wider than my authentic bottle (that I bought from a local department store). I then went and grabbed my bottle and compared it to my moms. The writing was a tiny bit smaller in font, but still close. But overall it APPEARED to be identical.Also, it didn't smell like Light Blue. Plus the scent only lasted a good 2 minutes. Whereas my authentic bottle will last hours! And if I spray it onto a shirt, the scent will last for days.I suggest NOT buying any perfumes online. Only get them in store or from HIGHLY trusted dealers, but still... just be careful.For me, spending an extra $10-$20 on a bottle at a department store is worth the risk of getting a fake off the internet."

148396,1,"My first experience with a sisal wash cloth was with The Body Shop, but when they no longer stocked it, I came to Amazon. Initially I chose Baudelair sisal wash cloth because it resembled my old sisal cloth. It was about the same size, not too large, and it had the loop for hanging, which I liked. I bought several cloths and gave some away because I wanted my friends to experience the cleansing of a sisal cloth. Everyone liked the cloth. After a few uses, the cloth becomes nice and soft because initially it is a little stiff. The cloth leaves my skin soft and well cleansed. When it was time to reorder, I turned to Amazon and ordered the same cloths. I put my cloth in the washing machine like I would any washcloth and it only gets better until I feel it must be time to discard and begin to use a new one. I really don't know how long I should use the cloth, but I use it until it finally begins to fray, which is after many months. Needless to say, I love this cloth and will continue to reorder this sisal wash cloth although I wish it was a little less expensive."
76388,0,"I'm considering buying my third one of these because it's always been easy to use when straightening my semi-curly hair. The frustrating thing, though, is precisely that it will be my THIRD ONE. I think I've had each of the previous ones for less than a year because after a few months it starts to smell like burning hair or plastic when using it, then after a few more months it sporadically fails to work when plugged in. Sometimes the combination of pushing reset buttons on the power outlet and on the plug will do the trick, but at some point it simply refuses to turn on again. I'm not sure if I can bear the hassle again, but I don't see any other dryer with a stiff brush attachment on the market."

71087,0,"I have been ordering this product for years now and I have always been very pleased with the results. For some reason,however, this latest purchase is not very satisfactory. I'm not sure if I just happen to get a faulty batch of hairspray or if they changed the product somewhat. This time the spray is more messy than usual. It is coming out very thick and clumpy. In the past, it always came out in a moderate spray and was easier to apply. When I shake the cans there is a rattling noise and I'm not sure if that has something to do with it. Any suggestions? Thank you."

I've only seen 1 or 2 mint colors in the store and the other was a mint apple, so it was too dark/green whereas this is more technically mint. LOVE it! I didn't have an issue like the previous reviewer, just put on my OPI hydrator as a base coat, 2 coats of re-fresh mint, then a coating of Sally Hansen no chip acrylic top coat and my nails were dry within 5 mins and look gorgeous as i check them out a day later :) Couldn't be happier!"
89538,0,"I have been using this product to give my hair texture for styling for years, and I seriously LOVE it...when I get a good jar of it. Some jars are far too watery which causes my hair to be limp and lifeless. Other jars are so thick and full of the fibers it is extremely difficult to spread it through your hair. If Tresemme could make every jar be a ""good"" jar, I would buy 1000 of them and stockpile it! Now that it is not available in stores near me, I will find a replacement product b/c the inconsistency makes it not worth ordering."
183569,1,"Much better than the cheaper models -- it's terrific at minimizing the frizzies. Not exactly a salon stylist blow-out, but not bad! The unit is well balanced and has nice quality control switches. A little heavier than the less expensive drug store driers, but well worth the performance (and cost) tradeoff."

102783,0,"I bought this product after my 9 month old son received (via the babysitters five year old daughter) a Very unfortunate haircut. I wanted something safe and gentle that would keep his hair pushed over to the side so his uneven bangs wouldn't be so obvious. This is certainly safe and gentle, but not so great at keeping his very long, very fine hair in place for very long. Probably works great for those babies without much hair, but he is not one of those babies and I often find myself reapplying two or three times a day."
68004,1,"After spending 30 years trying different men's fragrances, this one stands out a mile. Now, I won't buy any other. My wife bought me the first one, and (for once) she was right. Better still than the spray is the no-messing aftershave bottle version, but that's becoming hard to find."

102198,0,"This soap really is good for people who have eczema. I have had eczema ever since I was very young. However, the past several months my eczema has become very severe, and I actually had to get a shot from the dermatologist to help keep my outbreaks and inflammation down. I am very aware of the different types of soaps/ skin care products that are good for people who have eczema, but my skin is still irritated by a lot of them. This dead sea mud soap has worked tremendously for my eczema, and it has been an incredible blessing.I have to say, I've tried a few other dead sea mud soaps that are out there, and Adovia has been one of the best. Although I can say Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap has been the best soap for my eczema so far, the price increase is utterly ridiculous. When I first started buying this soap, it only cost around $8 a bar. Now that it's $18.99 + $3.10 shipping, I have to say I can no longer buy Adovia. $8 a bar was already higher than most other dead sea mud soap brands, and one bar goes by so fast (mud soap doesn't last as long as regular bar soaps).I would rate Adovia 5 stars for the product, but the price doesn't even make it worth it. It's really sad for me, because I thought I had finally found something to help my severe eczema (a skin condition people are born with and has no real ""cure"") without having to constantly pay so much money."

My hair stayed straight and perfect through the whole day and it took a few minutes to heat up, but not a half hour like my old straightener thankfully! One morning when I was using it the handle suddenly snapped. It wasn't like I was playing baseball with this thing, just straightening my hair. That was okay, I just used an oven mitt to hold it down on my hair. Now, about a month or two later, it won't heat up at all. It was nice while it lasted. I'll go out and buy something that hopefully last longer."

I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this. It works just OK during the shower. I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath. Maybe it's the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.I have sensitive skin &amp; therefore I'm really comfortable w/Neutrogena's light products.

That said, I would save your money and try a cheaper brush, or maybe a more expensive brush that lasts a lot longer."

6558,0,"I've had this for nearly 3 years. In that time, almost half of the silver paint has flaked off the handle and nozzle. I had to do a paint check of my hair after each use so it didn't look like I had silver dandruff. Even though the buttons are down the anterior side of the handle I find that if you use your left hand, you will repeatedly change your settings or turn off the unit all together. The unit gets super hot, that can be a plus or a minus - depending on your hair type. I have fine hair, so this dryer burns and fries my hair. The positive is that is is very light. Check my other reviews, I recently replaced this Revlon with a Conair that is superior in every regard except weight"
202037,1,"This hand creme is just lovely . . . .It smells very nice, a bit indescribable , and never leaves your hands feeling greasy. I would use it all of the time but I didn't buy enough the 1st time out. So now I will buy more and my hands will feel great all of the time."

We all know that Ralph Lauren products are pretty good products and for the person who has many males to buy for or for that matter younger guys this is the way to go. I found the Mini set to be a very reasonable price and it is shipped to you very fast. I divided the set and gave each Mini as an individual gift I can safely say that Sister in laws, Mother in law, and other female in laws were happy and most happy was my Wife. I bought a few of the Mini sets because the price is very good they arrived very fast they were easy to pack and the many females in my life were happy and that is rather important if you are a guy."
202844,0,"I use this for coloring my beard and mustache. This color works to get the grey out, but does irritate the skin. Years ago, it did not irritate my skin, but I guess they made some changes to the formula. Now, it will cause my skin to itch/burn for about a week, which is about how long the color lasts. Then I have to go through it all over again. Wasn't worth it, so I shaved the beard off, and kept the mustache which I slimmed way down to a Clark Gable style. On that little hair lip, it does not burn or irritate afterward. So that's what I live with. I guess I'm forced to continue buying this, but wish there was an effective, less irritating color kit available for men."

Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio.- Gail Cooke"

It allows your skin to breath so it doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts. One side note; It can tend to accentuate dry skin so make sure you moisturize beforehand if your skin is on the dry side or if you use drying skin products like Retinol etc. I use Jane Iredale's tinted moisturizer underneath it and love the way it looks, plus I feel like it makes it last a lot longer throughout the day and look that much smoother :) Bonus, it's waaay cheaper here on Amazon so I will buy here from now on!"

So, I wanted to try and stop the wrinkles in their tracks. My older sister however, has been into the whole world of wrinkle prevention since she was like 15 and it shows (everyone thinks she's my little sister and she's 3 years older). So I called her and this is the stuff she recommended. She also recommended the eye cream by the same manufacturer. The only thing she said is to make sure you never go out in the sun with this on your face because of the retinol. Anyway, I started using it and I have to say I really like it. It has exceeded my expectations and has actually begun to smooth some of the wrinkles I already had. Also, it doesn't smell like perfume so that's always a plus. So if you're a guy that isn't afraid to use a little product on the face to keep it looking young and wrinkle free...this is the stuff.P.S.-Their face wash is good too!"

Gets all the knots out without hurting like a comb, or brushes with the balls at the end of the plastic bristles. Helps tame the fly-aways and smooths beautifully!We think this is the best brush out there on the market. I have thinning fine long hair and my daughters have long beautiful fine yet very thick hair (two straight, one curly). Great for all types for fantastic styling and brushing - wet or dry. Not sure why people say they have pain - these are the only brush types I could use on my daughters when they were little that wouldn't hurt them with the tugging and pulling.Can't say enough about this wonderful brush!"

Furthermore, they are bulky, the clips are big as well, and I will be much better off skipping these on my next trip."

245409,2,"I purchased this to lighted age spots on the back of my hands and forehead. This product contains 6% Octinoxate to obtain SPF 15 and 1% Enzulzole for bleaching. I saw improvement for the first month, then lightening stagnated. Johnson and Johnson Ambi uses 2% Octinoxate for sunscreen and 2% Hydroquinone for bleaching. This was able to restart the bleaching process. I currently use the Neutrogena product in the morning to take advantage of the greater sunscreen and the Ambi at night. Bleaching continues after three months. Exposure to sun will reverse the bleaching and should be avoided."

36193,2,"I read so many positive reviews that I was extremely excited to try this shampoo. I have really dry 4a/4b hair, with 2 daughters that both have 4a. Unfortunately this product wasn't the moisture experience for me that it was for all the reviewers. Yes, I shook it before each use and it even lathered a LOT during washings, but after shampooing my hair felt completely stripped of any moisture that it had to begin with! It definitely felt clean as it felt stripped of everything, which is why I couldn't give it a 1 star rating...it at least did that. But moisturize, no. I bought the conditioner with it and that added no help whatsoever to softening or moisturizing my hair. It was extremely brittle and rough after drying....worse than when starting. I also tried it on both of my daughters' hair, tried leaving the conditioner on longer for deep condition, and have waited until 2 months after use to write this review just to be fair. It was the same result with their hair and every single time of use. It was like washing my hair with harsh dish soap. I really didn't like the smell either unfortunately. I was hoping that would be the one bonus. I hate wasting money, so I'm going to use it until the bottle is empty. I definitely won't be buying again though. Luckily I also bought a bottle of Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner which makes a dramatic difference in moisture for my daughters and myself. It keeps our hair soft and fluffy ALL day! Now that stuff is awesome!! It has helped counter balance the moisture stripping effect of this shampoo."

Me, I learned that even if a new product is from a company you trust and use products from, it's a good idea to test it first, before using it for real. (Apparently, I'm sensitive to something in this product.) However, my son likes it so much, that I'll more than likely buy this product for him."

27582,0,"I was kind of excited (and a bit scared) to try this on for the first time but it seems like it wasn't worth the $55... When I had it on, I got less reaction from people than when I was not wearing it. Now, I understand that many people stare/look at me already, without the cologne on, but I wanted to see if the ""science"" in this actually worked. As a man who believes more in science, I had high hopes for this product.I did not like the scent enough to make it my favorite cologne--the smell was leaning more towards a cheap perfume than a costly cologne. It doesn't smell bad enough for me not to wear, I just don't prefer it over other colognes. I am going to go back to my old cologne, John Varvatos, but for now, I am going to switch day-to-day from my old cologne to this cologne.My friend, who is a girl, told me that it turned her off (which is a good thing since I am aiming towards men). So, maybe the cologne does work but it just isn't not capable with me. Therefore, I cannot say that it didn't work because it obviously did something to my friend but I am not going to say that it did work since I received less reaction from people (reason for the three stars).I will be experimenting with this more, maybe mix it with Abercombie and Fitch's ""Wood"" cologne (since it doesn't have a great smell). But overall, it might be better just to wear your own ""unique"" cologne (or perfume, as I read that one of the reviewers is a girl) so that when you do find someone, they'll be able to connect you to your sent.If you wanted to know, the scent did not change with time when I applied it to my skin, which is usually a good thing. (I know many sprays do, that's why people who work in the cosmetic sections always spray these stuff on your hand.)"
166449,0,"VI is more floral than fruity to me. It's young, flirty, fresh, bright, clean and clear. VI is another fragrance that offers a take on a modern rose without being all about roses, if that makes any sense.There's much to like about this fragrance but not much to love imo. There is so many similar fragrances, yet one could do a lot worse that VI. However at this price, I'd go for something else!Sample-worthy, not bottle-worthy."

102141,0,"I was persuaded to buy this at my local salon, figuring I'd give it a try since the stylist had used it on my hair; it seemed like a promising product. First thing I found kind of hard to ignore was the price tag - at around $24 it's not cheap! (Then again AVEDA products never are, right?) I bought it anyway. This 'Defining Whip' appealed to me because the name implies a lightweight, natural hold. The packaging is fine, although it's kind of messy and unsanitary to have it in a pot (as opposed to a pump or squeeze bottle). The scent is pretty strong, almost overpowering. It smells intensely of lavender, but it may not bother some people. All AVEDA products smell extremely herbal, so you have to like that because it does linger. The consistency is very nice - creamy (yet not greasy-feeling) and 'whipped' as indicated. I had hoped that using this to separate my layers and define my ends would give me that coveted 'my-hair-just-looks-incredible-without-any-effort-at-all' look. Unfortunately the reality of the situation left me underwhelmed. While it did seem to give my layered style some definition, it did not hold the look for longer than, I'd say, about an hour. It also was not as ""weightless"" as I'd have preferred. By the end of the day, my hair felt heavy and sticky even. I wash my hair every other day, and I found it difficult not to shampoo before going to bed because my hair felt 'icky.' I've used this on my hair when it was both very short and quite long - it seemed to do more for my shorter hair. I think this product might be workable for a choppy pixie cut, or even a graduated bob style. But I wouldn't personally recommend it for hair that's any longer than shoulder length, because it does weigh it down. I should point out that my natural hair texture is thick, wavy, and somewhat coarse (typical Asian hair) and I'm admittedly not much of a 'product' person. Still, I wasn't impressed with this particular product."

239763,0,"I tried this on myself when going to Hawaii for the mosquitoes, and it worked okay in Hawaii. I just felt very oily and shiny. I sprayed it on again because I heard it repels fleas, and it totally worked! I think my friends thought I smelled a bit strong, but I was just so happy that the cat fleas stopped biting me. Recently, I sprayed it again on myself and my two year old son to repel the Portland summertime mosquitoes. And to my disappointment, it didn't work. We both got bit at least three times before dusk."
194767,2,"I was so excited about this color of polish. I was looking for a bright, fun summer color and this is a beautiful shade. However, to even get the color close to what it looks like on the bottle, you need at least 3 coats. And even with a good topcoat, it only lasted less than 2 days before it was peeling off so badly I had to remove it. It's a shame because I love china glaze polish and I was really hoping for this color to be my summer go-to, but I think I'll keep looking. Oh and this color is matte when applied so make sure if you decide to give it a try that you have a shiny topcoat handy, without it, it's not flattering."

218800,1,"This hair wrap is such a great invention. It's basically a headscarf with compartments that provide a place for gel pack inserts so that you can deep condition your hair without being tied to a bulky hairdryer. I purchased this product because it was suggested on a natural hair blog and because, as a student, I didn't have time to sit under a dryer all day. I had to study! This product was definitely the solution.To use this hair wrap, all you have to do is microwave the gel packs per the instructions written on each pack and then put them into the the wrap's compartments. Then you fasten it on your head and you are free to go about your business for about 30 minutes of deep conditioning. After 30 minutes, the heat is gone. I prefer to boil water and place the gel packs in it for 5 minutes rather than using the microwave because I have heard that the inserts can burst if heated too long in the microwave. I have never had a problem with boiled water method. When using this method, I even find that the wrap is often too hot to put on my head so I have to let it cool a bit before wearing it.I have two reasons for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5. The first is that when you put the wrap on your head, part of your head will not come into contact with the heat. You have to reheat the gel packs and then turn the wrap around to condition your entire head and that's just annoying. The second reason is because the material is really abrasive for your hair. You definitely can't just put the wrap on your hair without some sort ofElastic Plastic Processing Capto protect your hair. Even when just the edges of my hair touch the wrap, I notice some breakage. I just have to be extra careful to make sure that my entire hairline is under the plastic cap when I use this hair wrap.That said, I would suggest this product because it has made my life easier and served its intended purpose. Just make sure that you carefully heat the gel packs and wear a processing cap this hair wrap. Happy conditioning!"

95145,0,"Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right. So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn't the one with the dot, there's no way to tell if it's heated or not. Then you have to wait for one of the three clips to heat as well. It is weird! It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn't time it.This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn't rave about it. If not for the hassle, I'd return it.I just ordered another set that looks like the one I used to have with the U-shaped clips (BaByliss Pro) and hopefully it will be what I'm thinking it is."
28870,2,"I tried this product after reading some reviews that it is a good moisturizer/coverup for men. It feels good going on, but as it dries it creates a slight ghostly white appearance to your beard area. You can kinda rub it out but it just looks like you have dry skin or some type of white powder rubbed in.It is expensive but I won't return it yet and give it a few more days...unless a close friend asks me what's on my face.It does do what it says on the cheek, nose, and forehead area. It smooths out pores, does not look oily...still some ""whitish"" quality to it. I would think if you had black skin that it would look like you smeared something on your face...black guys beware!But my skin is already very fair...so I don't think it's noticeable.I will an update in a couple weeks...if anyone is interested...17 January 2013 UPDATE:I have been using this for about 1 week. It's just OK. It's just a moisturizer that doesn't make your face greasy. Save your money...the rave reviews are overblown. $28 for this...or $3 for a standard face moisturizer...same thing!No biggie..."

11780,0,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."

I know there are a lot of hair products that can be used on any and all types of hair but I normally stick to ethnic products and when I researched this product, I didn't know if the reviews were based on that, I just bought it. I like how it softens my hair. I usually relax my hair every 6 to 8 weeks and by the six week, I struggle to make it to the next week. Since using this product, I am almost at week 6 and it doesn't appear that it's almost time for the relaxer.

172256,0,It was kind of a pain to apply and it stinks but that's the price to get straight hair? right? Oh wait my hair is still not straight. I did what it said on the paper and comb it like crazy...or I thought I did and my hair still wavy...I don't even have tight curls just unruly wavy hair. Though it did relax my hair and it actually looks okay to wear down naturally without styling and not frizzy. After 48 hours I finally got to wash my hair and it still smells....hopefully after a couple of washes the smell goes a way.Would not buy the product again and now after reading the other reviews...now kind of scare my hair may fall out...so probably wait awhile before using a hair straighter or curling iron...

If it smelt like that consistently, it would be my favourite cologne.See, some perfumes spoil when they are exposed to sunlight or air. The problem with Colours is that it spoils that way, but it does it rather quickly, and it starts to smell repulsive. The smell can get rather strong and it gets embarrassing when you're out for the whole day. It's probably the only cologne you wish would fade away quickly.So, beware when you're trying the tester out. Don't buy this one immediately. Spray some on a tester card and wait. You'll be happy you didn't take this stinker home."

However, the scent dissipated within seconds and was replaced by a generic soap scent, kinda like grandma's stock of cheap hotel soap. It cleaned great and got really nice and sudsy.

You will never fail to pluck even the smallest, tiniest, least visible hair again because with the light and the powerful mirror, you'll see them all.

105514,2,This cologne has a very weird smell similar to Off! insect repellent or those citronella candles. It smells more like women's perfume than men's cologne. I bought it because of the price and the reviews on here. Just pass on it if you are thinking about buying it.
119084,1,My mothers favorite. Arrived ahead of time. No damage to box or bottle. EDP spray is a bit stronger then the TS.
149951,1,was shipped promptly and was packed properlythe size is a lil small than what i thought or what i am using right nowwould buy again
246770,1,"A long time favorite of mine, I cannot find it in stores any longer. Thanks to Amazon for carrying it!"
4203,2,"I even left this product in for 35 minutes and it only slightly lightened my dark hair. I was hesitant to use it because of the health hazards and the dryness I felt in the sample lock of hair I dyed; had it not been a gift, I would not have used it (did it for courtesy). The conditioner is wonderful, my hair feels great--but the color doesn't come close to measuring up to the model's hair."
86037,0,"Does the job and is effective, however it was unexpected to find it looks like glossy, clear fingernail polish when applied. If that was known, it probably would not have been purchased."
211837,1,"Dial soap is the most highly recommended soap for anti-bacterial and general use. Sam's Club stopped carrying Dial soap refills and started pushing Wal Mart's brand, same as they did with Glad Bag sandwich bags. So, we go to Amazon and get both now for about the same price and delivered instead of working your way through a distant warehouse with a pack of strangers as surly about being treated like cattle as we are. Turns out that the Dial Antimicrobial works just like the other type with the added benefit that 'antimicrobial' also addresses filth problems like fungus and parasitic microbes. Just a few more items of what we prefer delivered for about the same price and we can tell Sam's Wally-World Club to kiss it right in the middle. PBBBT!!"
28069,0,Good product i bought it in other occasion and I want buy others to gift me or others ooo ooo
121362,0,This fragrance is more masculine than feminine. The fond memories of yesterday did not live up to the reality of today. I would not buy this again for myself.
102975,1,Very nice for summer and spring seasons...smells like you just stepped out of the shower all day long.Definitely recommend
230970,0,". . . feels cheap in the hand. Takes two hands to insert the dryer back into the holder, which is kinda awkward."
166913,0,"I applied it 3 nights in a row to get the color I wanted. I was discouraged the first night not seeing much of a change but decided that I like the gradual increase in tan rather than one big change that some other tanners offer. I agree that after showering the tan fades. The best of the color lasted about 3-4 days for me. I used it on my face and liked the color it gave; I have large pores and it didn't make me look speckled or anything. If you want to look tan for a specific event, I would recommend using this 1-2 nights right before that event and don't count on it lasting more than 4 days."
119533,0,"The Sorbie shampoo is an excellent product. I have been using it for many years; it never leaves any deposits in my hair. The only ding against this purchase was that one of the bottles that I received was damaged and leaking. I had purchased this before from another reseller without incident, and will probably return to that reseller."
96618,0,"I liked that this was 100% Argan Oil, but I couldn't get over the smell. It does not go away like some people say. I used it on my hair and could smell it always. Especially when you are out in the sun. And even my pillow smelled. I like Moroccanoil,(one word) for hair, so much better."
72772,2,I received the product as promised. I have used this perfume for over 4 years and this recent purchase does not smell like perfume. It may not even be perfume. I am sending this product back. I will buy direct from the manufacturer. This should have zero stars.
204661,0,"Smells good, but I do resent manufacturer/bottler making the hole at the top of the bottle way too large to cause more fluid to come out than typically desired by the ordinary consumer. Obviously, it was deliberate company decision to cause product to get used quicker even as it frustrated the user, in the US commercial corporate tradition of sacrificing consumer interests in the pursuit of ever increasing profit. With some effort I was able to cut off the tip of a retractable ball point pen and glue it upside down into the large hole to solve the problem. Thankfully there's Amazon's opportunity for consumers to sound off at anti-people policies with customer reviews."
241724,0,"After I read some of the reviews for this shampoo, I thought maybe it really would make my hair feel thicker and have more body. But I was so disappointed when I used it. I didn't find it did anything for my hair except clean it and give it a fresh smell. Those are good things, but I could have gotten them for a lot less money by using Suave."
231762,1,"Typical I don't buy Essie brand nail polish besides their ridge filling base but this color attracted me. I was always worried about how this color would look on my dark brown skin tone but once I gave in and bought; I don't know what the doubt was about! It looks great on me and I have a feeling it'd look better on all skin types. I really don't like to brushes on Essie nail polish because it doesn't give me that professional finish look I enjoy at a nail salon but overall the color is great. A great base and top coat will allow this color to last at least 2 days, possibly more."
189560,2,"What a huge disappointment. I've used Purell before and their products have always seemed to be of very good quality. I have found the exception! The sanitizing hand wipes should ONLY be used as sandpaper! Maybe a solid desktop could handle it, but only if it needs to be refinished. Do not waste your money!"
168674,1,"I like demi-permanent haircolor, esp. for dark shades, because they are not so damaging. Dark permanent color gets absorbed into your ends to the point that if you wanted to change colors, you would have to get it stripped out- which is very drying. Not the case with a demi- permanent. Color charm has been around for awhile, but its a good solid product. I recommend it."
79420,0,LOVED THE SPRAY AS THE GLITTER SHINE ON MY HAIR AND CLOTHES WAS REALLY CHRISTMASY AND MY DAUGHTER DID AS WELL BUT IT IS A LITTLE HARD ON THE LUNGS TO BREATHE IN
147543,1,"I received the product on time. No problems are noted so far. I mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs. Recently I used the brush attachment to blow out my hair. I used both high and low settings. It worked amazingly. If your a natural, you definitely should own this product. It has surely put some smiles on my face!"
184221,2,"I never usually pay over $2 for a bottle of nail polish since I generally just use it on my young daughter who likes to change her nail color often. I purchased this at a store for about $6 and am sorry that I did. It may be a $6 bottle of nail polish, but I have $2 bottles of nail polish that's better than this. You have to apply multiple coats to get the full color of this silver polish ... And even after you've done that, it chips very easily. I only gave it 1 star because I had to ... Its a waste of money, IMO."
15009,2,"I have loved this fragrance for forty years. The last bottle I bought was near the end and I no longer live near my fragrance shop. I saw it on Amazon and thought &#34;yeah&#34;! It is nothing like the wonderful scent it should be.. There is an unpleasant, metallic sort of finish to the scent. I looked into returning but found it couldn't be done. I am stuck with an expensive bottle of disappointment."
144793,2,"I love all the Pleasures scents ... except this. It is too heavy and has a scent that gives me a headache. Maybe it smells like this on me, but I do not like it at all."
239039,1,"My now husband wore this cologne when we dated, it still makes me swoon when he wears it, hence I bought more."
241059,2,"when ordered I thought it was the real cologne. The name and box are the same, but the cologne smells different. I didn't tell my husband I ordered it and the first time he used it he said this is not the same. It wasn't that much less expensive that the real thing and I don't like being swindled. Won't buy from them anymore."
38298,0,"I have used this kit in the past and I love the products included. I especially like the cuticle cream and banana hand cream. However, the kit I received did not come with the banana cream, instead it came with the almond milk hand cream. A little disappointed, but all in all, a good product."
136670,1,"This does actually make your hair grow faster and the conditioner is keeping my hair in great shape. What a fantastic product, I will be buying these again."
217934,0,"I purchased this product because it was suppose to be unrefined; however, it is too creamy to be unrefined and did not seem to have the desired effect on my hair and skin as the shea butter that is hard and rock-like in appearance. I would not recommend this product as an all day moisturizer but it is fine for coverage on small areas."
211317,1,"Very good cologne, length of smell is fair. Smells of citrus and spice. I believe good cologne for anytime of day or night."
49402,1,"No perfume I've ever worn has received as many compliments, or requests to know ""what is that fragrance you're wearing?"" from other women. Even men have noticed and complimented me on my perfume--happened again just last week. I love Tocade because it is subtle and evocative, but never overpowering. Try it! You'll like the gentle floral scent with woodsy undertones, and you'll be amazed at how a little fragrance goes such a long way! (Note that the product description was wrong in 2007, listing the wrong designer--it should be ROCHAS not Ungaro.)"
29376,2,"I made a mistake and ordered the wrong Chloe scent as a Christmas present for my daughter--I guess she wanted the latest Chloe perfume and I neglected to clarify. Anyway...Amazon is generally great about accepting returns, but when I tried to return this item I learned it was classified as a ""hazardous material"" and because of that it was not returnable. I ordered a whole bunch of stuff at the same time that I ordered the perfume, but I honestly don't remember any kind of a warning or notice alerting me that this item couldn't be returned. If there was one, then I missed it and I am certainly at fault.My experience with Amazon in the past has been great, but this left a bit of a bad taste."
68713,0,"I brought this product for Hyper-pigmentation considering i have Mediterranean skin.i Give this Two rating , 4 stars for a good exfoliation of the skin without a strong glycolic acid base leaving little damage to the skin. 3 Stars however from its lack of affective for hyper pigmentation, so i suggest use a bleaching agent for a month then use this produce in between the bleaching therapy so the bleaching agent can effectively bleach the melanin without dead skin interrupting the process. This product combined with a bleaching agent that does not chemically react to it severely works the best, and i enjoy the direction of being able to sleep with it over night, very comforting and no allergic reaction and no peeling of skin on my figured of frequent use."
131387,0,"The package says human hair, but as someone that has used many brands of human hair over many years, this is probably the worst quality of ""human hair"" I have ever seen. It looks AND feels like synthetic hair, so ah duh, I'm gonna guess that's what it is... although the package says it is Premium Human Hair. I've been braiding hair for over 10 years and this is definitely not 100% hair. Then again, you get what you pay for.I will say, however, that I bought this hair and it arrived in 3 days. (great on the seller's part.. thank you!) but as for the product itself, I won't be purchasing it again. I went ahead and used this hair on myself and my braids look fine, as they usually do.. but I can definitely notice a difference when I play with it. My braids have been in for about 2 weeks now and they still look good.. so if you don't mind a majority of a synthetic hair as opposed to human hair (blend), then go for it. But you've been warned!"
239734,1,I am a 40+ year old man. I get this mainly because the normal skin so soft works well against bugs. I don't like chemical bug repellent even the one that skin so soft puts out. The normal one does great and I am real happy with it. It smells great. Happy camper. Dave
70623,0,"Sadly, this product didn't do much for my psoriasis. The itching and the dandruff became worse. Despite that I would like to say that it does make hair soft and manageable. Of all the medicated shampoos I have tried, it's the best one for that. I'm sorry this product didn't work for me though. It might still work for someone else."
167909,0,"I received this lotion in a gift pack containing in addition to the lotion a shower gel, a candle and a loofah mitt. (Don't ask about the loofah mitt - the hemp was so rough that it actually scraped).This is an okay lotion. The addition of lavender and Shea Butter sounds good, but I can't find the proportions of either on the bottle. The lavender fragrance is very muted, and doesn't really smell wonderful such as in say, L'Occitane. Somehow, due the moisturizing effectiveness I wonder if there isn't quite enough Shea Butter included.On the plus side it is a very generous 16 oz. bottle for not very much money. (Who was it who said you get what you pay for?)"
68346,1,"I purchased this a little over 2 weeks ago, and so far it seems to be an excellent product. The only problem is I didn't actually purchase it from Amazon but through one of their suggestions, and I had to sign for it and missed the mailman the first time he brought it. Next time I will make sure I purchase it from Amazon, but I am a new customer and wasn't aware of what I was doing."
88397,0,"I am not impressed. The colors are light when applied, and it gets greasy and sticks in the creases of your eyelid."
239489,0,"this has a weird smell, it works pretty well but I almost try not to use it unless completely necessary because of the bad smell."
95450,0,"This is a VERY basic hairdryer. It has no attachments, and no heat control. It also has only 2 fan speeds. Other than that, it does what it is suppose to do - dry hair. If you want a cheap, basic hair dryer, this serves the purpose."
45648,2,Please do not buy this item. It does not have any quality of other polo products. If you buy any perfume go with other companies. Do not waste your money. I feel I have wasted my money.
109760,0,"It smells nice (just like you remember) but fades quickly and isn't worth it. I bought this for something cheap to wear to work but will go back to wearing Paco Rabanne's 1 Million (way stronger and better!). Spend the extra cash, trust me."
132820,1,"I used this for skin sores from shingles and dry skin. When I'm at home I use the lotion because I find it easier to apply. When I'm traveling I take the cream, it is more convenient."
188911,1,"LOVE IT!! Try this fragrance, you will love it and others will too. Very clean and light smelling...Great product. Thank you Philosophy!!"
183764,1,"I love this hair dryer it makes my hair softer and dryes very fast and I have very long thick natural hair (african american), and the solano international 2 in 1 professional comb goes great with it sold separate"
147913,2,I use Eternity all the time and know its scent. Buy it in Macys or other trusted stores.
181724,0,"I love China Glaze polishes... good quality for a great price. In the picture this colour looks like a deep coral but when i applied it last night, it is practically orange. Still a pretty colour, just not what I was expecting."
98325,0,"I love Fantasy, but this one almost has a grape smell to it. Also, it doesn't last as long as Fantasy."
50146,1,i am well pleased with the quality and utility of this product. the comb fits well in my pocket and produces an effect upon my hair that makes styling in any particular way easy.i am sure that i will have this product for a good long time without the worry of losing its teeth.many thanksharry ruggeroli
86345,1,My 2.5 year old son sucks his thumb when he's sleeping. I tried this product hoping it would stop him from sucking his thumb & it did! The first time I put it on his thumbs was before his nap. He cried for 20 mins saying his thumb was grody!! I coat his thumb nails in the morning before he leaves for daycare & at night before bed. I've only had the product for about 2 weeks but it has worked wonders. I would highly recommend this product to parents who child has a thumb sucking problem. He actually ask for me to paint his nails before bed now & says I don't suck my thumb.
237607,1,I've tried all of Dr. Bonner's soap and love them all. However this is the 1st time I've tried the Rose and it has such a wonderful scent. I've used this product for well over 10 years and have share how nice it is to others. Once you try it you will not go back to regular soap.
156384,0,"The shipping was fast and the straightening comb works really well, I am satisfied."
243974,0,"This product is intended for dry, sensitive skin, which I have. It is a moisturizing deodorant soap bar. I didn't like the strong deodorant scent. I prefer a softer one. It also didn't seem to moisturize very well. It does have a good lather, though and rinses without leaving behind a filmy residue."
31688,0,"I bought this because for two reasons: I trust Coppertone as a brand, and I LOVE the smell of this stuff. Water Babies, Dreft & original Johnson's & Johnson's baby shampoo are all scent-heaven to me.Unfortunately though, I had to discontinue using it. I put some on my 5 month old son, and he developed a sensitivity to it and broke out in an ugly rash. After a trip to the pediatrician and a prescription for 2% hydrocortisone ointment, we realized it was probably from the -benzone's in the sunscreen. Evidently this is a somewhat common reaction to those ingredients, at least according to a Google consensus.Let me say that my son is NOT one of those sensitive-skinned, bubble-baby types. We use plain Dreft or Tide on his clothes, he gets scented lotions & powders and regular old Johnson's bath products. I was a bit shocked when he all of a sudden had a reaction to a health & beauty type product. The only other thing he has had a reaction to is Huggies diapers (Pampers are fine though). And believe me, I am ALL about baby-scented-products. Anything to cover up the poop smell is fine by me :)We switched to Neutrogena Pure & Free Baby, which is a zinc oxide product with good results. However, that stuff is rather spendy for how much sunscreen we go through (ten for a 3 oz bottle vs. seven for a 8 oz bottle of Coppertone!), so I am now going to try to the ""Free & Clear"" version of my beloved Water Babies. If only it smelled like the original... (but it did live up to it's Tear Free promise!)"
7059,0,"I received it today, but when I opened the package, I found that it's not the one showed in the picture on amazon.com, it's actually another Spray (3.3 ounces), but I don't want to change it anymore because I like its smell."
86481,0,"We bought this product for my four year old. She likes to suck on two of her fingers on a particular hand and we had hoped to help her to stop. We explained to her while we waited for the product to arrive what would happen and she was very excited and happy. She has made comments that she wants to stop to. When we got the product we applied it to her fingers and it did taste nasty. It worked great for the first day. But while the box says to apply every two days, we discovered on the second day that it needed to be applied every 12 hours and then by the third day every 8. And by the fourth, it seemed to not have an effect on her at all. She may have gotten used to the taste or it may have been washing off, but either way, by the fourth day it wasnt working. A habit supposedly takes 21 days to break, but we didnt even make it past 4. I would not recommend this for a younger person. It may work on an adult though."
1060,0,"Well - I just killed it. I guess my hot air styler sucked in one too many pieces of my hair. This has been an ongoing problem in the year I've had it. While doing a nice job at making my hair less frizzy and adding volume; it also ate my hair... a lot... despite all attempts to get my hair away from the air intake.I just went to turn it on. No noise, no air, just a burning smell.It worked really nicely though and I love the compact size, great for travel. I'm debating over getting another one. If I do, I'll definitely register the warranty!"
57466,0,"I guess it works. I don't really know how to tell if the item is working or not, but since I keep buying it it most be doing something (smile)"
182937,2,"I waited a little before i did this review, but that's only because i wanted to be nice and give them back their product. but i won't hold my tongue now so here goes:1. this product smells HORRID ! green apple ? not even close. more like fish and salt& vinegar chips (and maybe a little more, but i refused to use it again once i closed the bottle lol) it honestly made me want to gag!2. it doesnt do anything a good leave in conditioner would do! so why bother having my hair smelling like fish and chips if i can use a conditioner ?3.i barely used any and it stil flaked into booger-like crumbles, which looked sooo nasty in my hair >_&lt;4. i paid for the product + shipping and handling. i dont care how much you decide to put as a shipping price, but when i want an unsavory product sent back, i should be able to right ? NOPE. they sent me a bogus shipping label that i could have printed myself. so basically they want me to have to pay all charges to send it back to them. apparently they dont want their product either. but I DONT WANT TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT, WTF!!!! so they're gonna have to fix that ASAP.VERY DISSATISFIED.DONT EVEN LOOK TWICE AT THIS PRODUCT.until i get my money back ;)"
196665,1,Real good product and recommend to others. My wife and daughters are very happy with it and use it all the times.
223804,2,"Back years ago this scent was somewhat ok, I remember having a small bottle of it someone gave me.I thought I would enjoy it again so asked for it as a gift.I was wrong.It was heavy and gave me somewhat of a headache.It's to old lady like.And very musky.I wouldn't recommend this scent.I sold it on ebay.I have noticed yellow or golden colors of perfume are too strong and musky."
156624,0,"The polish looks much lighter in the bottle in real life than in the picture, but it's much brighter on your fingers than in the bottle. It's also pearlescent, which was kind of a surprise to me. I love the color though, along with China Glaze in general. It dries SUPER FAST.The product is very hard to work with, however. Since it's a white based color, it's hard to get it to apply evenly. It's also very matte, so if you want it to be shiny, use a top coat."
159134,2,"Goldwell website claims this is ONLY sold to select salons and distributors. Amazon is not one of them? I am so sick of getting these type of items ""fake"". Why??These are huge jugs of product but if you look at the bottles the label comes right off (label is plastic, stick on that includes codes, evertyhing). You could easily put these labels on any old bottle of shampoo/treatment. There is NO WAY to know if these are real or authentic. Bottom Line."
87796,0,"This product makes my hair very soft and silky. I love the way my hair feels after I use it. As far as reducing frizz goes, I do have to admit, I have had other products work better. Moroccan Oil or Pureology Serum have worked a little better for me, but those products also leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy. This product provides a weightless feel and my hair is super silky. I love mixing it in with my leave-in conditioner. I am probably going to purchase this product again, just because I love the way it makes my hair feel and it does reduce frizz."
14191,0,"I decided to try this product. I am starting to see the wrinkles and fine lines. I definitely felt the stinging/burning sensation the first time I tried it. I could only keep it on for 1 minute. I've been doing this treatment for a few weeks now, once a week. I'm not sure if I see the difference, but my co-worker said my face looked different. After using the product a few more times, I can tolerate the stinging for longer now, I'm up to 3-4 minutes now. I haven't had any recent acne break-outs so I am assuming this is a contributing factor."
170461,1,"The pic of this color is way off, its hot coral not pink. I love it, I wore it ALL summer on fingers AND toes!"
1046,2,It doesnt do anything to my hair but take an hour to dry it and make it frizzy. Doesnt do what it says it does. it makes it very poofy & frizzy.
243735,0,It seemed to work really well. But did dry out my skin. The instructions suggest using it a lot less frequently at first and I would highly recommend that also (especially if you have sensitive skin).
53139,2,"I had no idea what this smelled like, but at 75% off, I figured ""what the heck""? Boy was I wrong...this stuff is awful."
48081,0,I haven't tried many dry shampoos but this for me was okay. It does the job of removing the oil from your hair. But it's difficult to rub it in well enough (I have blonde hair) to get rid of the powdery look it leaves behind. It also would leave flakes sometimes and give an appearance of dandruff...not cute.
102064,0,"This is a good overall cutter. It comes with all the necessary combs in all of the standard lengths, and the cutter has a taper control so you can adjust the length even further. It includes scissors, hair clips, a vinyl apron, brushes, and a decent storage case to put everything in. It has everything I was looking for.I have been using this to keep my hair between 1/4"" and 3/8"" for the last two months. I cut my hair twice a week, every 4-5 days. The cutter does a good job, as long as you have patience and control. I can get the cut I want within 15 minutes. I prefer to use the unit plugged in, because I find that it runs slower from the battery alone. However, that said, I found that it would allow me to cut my hair at least 3 times before I had to recharge. This is pretty significant and acceptable. It also takes a long time to completely charge the battery (the manual states 14 hours), but there is no indication that charging is completed -- the charging light is always lit when it is plugged in.It's lightweight and easy to handle. The cord is long enough to use when plugged in. Controls are simple and smooth.The included trimmer is OK, not great. I have used it to clean up my sideburns and neck line, but prefer to use a trimmer on my shaver instead. The included trimmer runs on 2 AAA batteries, and it also seems to run a little slower than I expected. However, it doesn't scratch, and I have sensitive skin, so although it's not a quality item, it does the job.Overall I'm happy with this device and don't have any complaints."
199623,0,I purchased this product after an article on the dangers of some sunscreen ingredients. Received in good time from Amazon. The bottles were so small and really meant more for just babies. I was hoping to have my teen use these products in his soccer bag.
227599,1,"I've used Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Detangler for several years and have always purchased it from a local Beauty Supply house. Unfortunately about a year ago this place closed. I ran out a few months later and have been without this product for at least 6 months and I really miss it. I've tried several other products, some much more expensive, but none of them make my hair look as good. I can't live without this stuff. It gives my hair volume, makes it so easy to comb out after shampooing and gives it a beautiful healthy shine. I just love it! I have semi-fine hair but a lot of if and it works perfectly for me. I'm so thrilled I found it on Amazon. I should have known! Amazon came thru for me again...THANK YOU AMAZON!"
31510,1,"Hello,Received 1st order included two free sample slices of soap 1 - frankincense other (2) myrrh.1st impression (did not like odor). Opened - ??? Maybe two scents together clashed.SMELLS Great - Myrrh is more woodsy for men, but may appeal to women remind me of log cabin outdoor person would love.Curious - samples instructions to use as potpourri, used frankincense to wash face.BEST SOAP- (I have sensitive skin) only use clearsil soap or black soap.BENEFITS - (I thought the reviews were overrated, but they are not).... Face felt refreshing cleaner than ever hard to explain.Skin was smooth, face felt great kind of like after a mask treatment (if you have used before).SKIN TYPE: African American/SensitiveSUMMARY - Thanks for free sample.you must try this soap - Will order few bars different scents in goat milk."
150254,0,"I used this item, wasn't impress, I know no product is going to remove wrinkles, but didn't notice any difference on my skin.I am better off for the price, to buy the cheaper product that I have been purchasing from my local CVS. I do have to say in their behave, they ship fast."
35329,0,Ok I was really excited when I first got this it was very small but beautiful holder. Then comes the perfume when I first used it the scent was very faint but it stay on my skin the whole day which was nice but then the second and third time around the scent was harder to find until I cant smell it at all but wax blah.
147546,2,"I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product."
75386,0,This perfume is okay if I hold it at a distance over my head and spray so it drifts down onto me - otherwise it is too strong for my taste.
189614,0,"Convenient and inexpensive but I like the old product better. The old product did not drip had a much better feel to them. I ordered several boxes because of the price but I did have another problem. The wipes I purchased were not due to expire for another eight months, however, I have opened several wipes that have already dried out."
184392,2,"Used this product on alternate days for a few weeks. Used it on the temples, and nothing happened. The situation worsened at best"
183582,1,this blow dryer is excellent but be prepared it's heavier than most and is also very powerful. on high heat and maximum speed it has a tendency to tangle my hair. very very good product though.
187534,2,"I really have no idea what the fascination is with this brand. I've tried so many shades hoping that maybe the last was a fluke. But, this brand is awful IMO. It's difficult to apply, applies streaky, and chips so easily. I much prefer OPI."
231115,2,"The Triple Power Gel Strengthener from Nutra Nail didn't really live up to the claims on the package for more than until I had to put my hands in water. I have tried it about 6 times already, and it never fails to start peeling off from the edges on the same day it is applied. I have even tried using less than the recommended coats (2 initially, nail polish and then 2 more coats after). Still the desirable results only for the moment. I was really disappointed. The package recommended returning to product to the company for a full refund if the desired results were not attained, however, because I have been trying so many times to make it work, of course I could no longer locate the receipt. It was only 5 dollars anyway, I'd probably have to pay a comparable amount for the shipping.The verdict: Looks really nice at initial application, but doesn't stay on past the end of the day.As I write this review, I am trying the Power Gel Nail Hardener formula. I'll write a review on that later as I ascertain the results.Happy nail care."
233163,2,"This polish, in color Pippa, is the worst I have encountered by Zoya. It is thick and bubbly. It won't spread out and looks like Swiss Cheese as it dries. I have not been able to use it once since I ordered it. I like the seller just fine, but they do not except returns. Still, this is something I would have never paid for had I known. I was really looking forward to wearing beautiful bright yellow polish. I guess I'll just have to wait a while, as I can't get this kind of polish where I live (I'd try the Butter color next) (on an island) and shipping for one nail polish is ridiculous."
89402,2,"These combs actually appear on the screen larger than the actual size, so be careful that the smaller version is the one you actually want. There was also a 7 inch comb, which is the one I would have rather purchased, but by the time I received them, it was too late for me to exchange them."
199882,1,"When my old blow dryer bit the dust I thought I was going to have to pay some outrageous price to get a decent dryer. This product meet my expectations and then some. Given my previous dryer was a Brookstone Travel hair dryer, so it didn't have all that many features, but it was compact and lasted me a good 6-7 yrs. Anyway, I love all the different heat settings, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot lighter than I'm used to. On the downside, it's rather heavy (though again, I'm switching from a little travel hair dryer), I sort of feel like I have to grow some extra muscles in my hands for this thing."
89631,0,"I might have given this product more stars, but the scent is similar, if not identical, to the scent worn by someone I can't stand, and I couldn't separate the two. I couldn't even put it on--just gave it away. Sorry I couldn't be more objective."
194194,0,"I have thick wavy long blonde hair. I'm trying to tame it without spending an hour or two in the process. Unfortunately, for me, this brush is only ok. The size is good for my long hair but the tines are so short that I can only brush a very small section of hair at a time or half my hair blows away. If the tines were twice as long it would be the right brush for me because it would be able to hold larger sections of hair without them slipping away."
101643,0,"I was super excited when I first received this because I had been wanting to buy it for several months. And when I tried it out I fell in love with it immediately. Unfortunately, that only lasted a few uses. For some reason (I've had it about 2 weeks), it just doesn't crack right anymore. It's very goopy. And if you take more than one swipe to cover your whole nail, it will be thicker in the middle where you apply more than one coat. Also, if you mess up, you have to redo the entire nail (base coat and all)."
181507,0,"When it says neon it's definately what I think of when I hear the word neon. Bright and bold!You need around 3 coats to make it look even and like all China Glaze neons it is matte. I love this color for deigns on my nail, but it's not my favorite overall nail color for a better alternative orange from China Glaze I would recommend Papaya Punch for China Glaze's 2011 Island Escape collection."
44228,2,But took 3 weeks to receive it.. I pretty much forgot that I had ordered it. This is my favorite face soap
64221,0,"I tried this and it did seem to work, however, the pad no longer sticks to me and it has only been 2 weeks since I started using it. I would highly recommend this if it either came with replacement pads or if it did stay adhesive longer. I'm currently looking for a replacement."
112246,0,I was recommended to use Aubrey organics and I honestly do not like any of their products.As for this one since its watery you can use this as a skin toner like witch hazel.Aloe vera contains natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.Its gentle and cool on the eyes while wiping you face.
208491,0,I intially wrote a terrible review because I was not using it correctly. Then I realized I needed to hook the dryer behind the stand holder. Now it holds the dryer well. However the extender does not stay stiff and you cannot really adjust the height. The extender just stays down at the lowest height. But it basically is ok.
52167,0,"I'm a huge Bumble & Bumble fan, but this one is literally like a jar of wax. It definitely has major control for your hair, but I pretty much need to wash my hair before going to bed unless I want it all over my pillow and getting on my face while I sleep.If you're looking for something that waxy it's probably great but I think the less waxy version in the black jar is better and less extreme."
87069,0,"Makes my skin feel amazing, but the smell is just gross. It has a weird after smell, it's hard to explain, but def not something you want to smell all day. Also the bottle is small so if you are using it as an all over lotion, you will go through it really fast."
194406,0,"you can't tell from the photo that this is a sparkly color... but i figured i'd keep it for a halloween costume or some crazy night out. the shade of blue is really nice, just wish it was not full of glitter"
1457,1,It work from the very first week I started using it. I use it at night and in the morning.I work late hours and I've been having a problem with puffy eyes. This gel has really help me decrease the puffiness.I recommend it.
94008,0,The product arrived quickly but i was curious if my sisters would think it smelt good at all so I sprayed it on a piece of paper and let them smell it and they immediatly said it smelled terrible. I have not field tested it and may try combining it with my addidas colonge and see if that combats the smell so i can get results. Will write a review later describing my findings.
89464,2,"I was a little disappointed with this lip pencil. It was nice, the way it is designed; flat; but, it was very dry and too dark."
89472,0,I bought this for my flare up psoriasis to remove the severe itch and and relief from the lesions on my scalp. I didn't like the product - seem to itch more after application.
153465,2,"There is something in this gel that my skin REALLY doesn't like. I have pretty sensitive skin, but after using this for a couple of days, I haven't seen it get this red and irritated in years. Tread with caution if you have sensitive skin."
104607,0,"I got this for my halloween costume and while it got the job done, it wasn't a product I'd look forward to using again. The coverage wasn't great. I had to use 2 cans to cover my updo and even then you could still kind of see my light brown hair under the white spray. It also made my hair very much like helmet and pretty much destroyed the curls I had spent so much time putting into my hair (since it weighed my hair down SO much.)"
89145,2,"My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...LAST CHANCE T3 !side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !"
165451,0,I am unsure of how to work this properly. It is not intuitive. It tells you in the directions that it takes awhile to get used to. But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.
249407,0,"I was researching Emu oil for hair growth for my eyelashes and stumbled upon a blog that suggested adding this. I had been using the Emu and while it was working great i'm of the mindset that if some is good, more is better. I added this to the mix. My eyelashes are still growing and the hair i lost in my brows with the permanent tattoo is still coming in. I have no idea if this works or not..haha!! If you are thinking of using this on your head you must be a person who washes their hair daily. This creme is a bright blue that stays blue after application. The first night i used it my granddaughter told me i had used wayyyy too much eye shadow.....haha"
65732,2,The scent of the perfume received was mild and is definitely an imitation of the product. I have another bottle to compare with and it was not the same at all. Very disappointed.
10822,1,Good sturdy and good looking/quality product. We just hoped the shipping package was a bit more sturdy to keep it from breaking in transit (not that our was damaged)good product!
234033,1,This happens to be my personal favorite cologne and I have been told by several stores that it was discontinued so I can't buy it locally anymore! It arrived in a nice package on time and was sealed shut. I will definitely be ordering another bottle from the seller when I run out!
215891,1,This is one of the few scents that I can wear. I have allergies to many chemicals. This perfume is made from essential oils and lasts longer than others I've tried. It has a complex warm spicy scent that can be worn by men or women.
68497,2,"I've purchase a similar product in the past from Whole Foods Market and I fell in love with it. It was the perfect size and texture and it lasted many years before I had to throw it away. I decided to get a new one, so I purchase this product after reading the glowing reviews. It didn't come with any instructions really on how to break it in or take care of it, regardless it look very small (11""x11""?, I think it's real shady when you can't read the box on Amazon, the picture and what I have look different, and they don't even tell you the size on Amazon) compare to the one I had before and this one is a lot rougher too. I used it once and the thing twisted and shriveled up and now I'm left with something that looks like a 2""x7"" pork rind. This is handmade and it's quite apparent because of all the imperfections. For crying out loud, I scrub my thigh this morning and ended up cutting myself because a part of the cloth decided to shank me? Now I have two minor, but bloody red lines on my left thigh. Please avoid this product!!! I had to learn the hard way. So do yourself a favor and continue searching for that perfect cloth and I hope you find it!"
44170,2,"With a name like ""Kiss My Face"" I was hoping for soap with a pleasant smell but it smells like wet cardboard. Very unappealling muddy green color. It doesn't lather up very well and didn't seem to have any moisterising effect at all. I gave it two stars because it rinses well."
244650,0,"I'd been searching for something I could use on my face to cut down the oil product. My nose and forehead areas get SO oily that it makes makeup impossible. I shine so brightly with or without makeup that it got to be a problem and I wanted to find a way to cut that down. I saw all the great reviews that were posted on amazon and I actually found it at my local drug store on sale. Score one for me!Yes, it cleans very well. It also makes my skin so smooth. I love the feeling after I've washed my face. The problem? Didn't cut down my oil production at all. I'm still just as shiny as I've ever been so this didn't help me one bit. I also noticed that when I began using it, I broke out. I guess my skin needed to get used to it so I continued for about 2 weeks and I was still getting new bumps just as fast as old ones went away. I stopped using it and went back to my old face wash, I cleared up, then went back to this and broke out again, except it wasn't as bad.I will try again in the future and hope for the best, but for now, I'm going back to my old face wash and will just pat the shiny areas dry as often as I can think about it."
6313,0,"This dryer doesn't get as hot as my previous Revlon dryer. It gets hot, but only in the Hot & High setting, but not in the Hot & Low setting, which I would use for styling. It takes longer to dry my hair and I can't get it to look the same as it did with my previous dryer."
148369,1,"I have used this twice along with the other products in the Regenerist line. My skin is very,very soft!It smells fantastic! Like oranges.The only thing I dont like about it is when you apply the derma-crystals (step one) you have to rub it in for a minute and it really is uncomfortable! It feels just like rubbing sand on your face.The first time I used it I felt like I had a ""sunburn feel"" on my face. But it went away after a couple days. I follow this with the Daily Serum."
211775,1,"This product really does feel like silk....Out of all the eye products, I really like this one. I would recommend it!"
164480,0,"I started using Burt's Bees Repair Serum around my eyes to soothe and moisturize after I had an allergic reaction to an expensive eye cream (rash, redness, & wrinkly skin). It was the only thing that didn't irritate the skin around my eyes. My eyes took a good two weeks to return to normal, so I wouldn't say that the serum accelerated healing, but at least it moisturized without irritating. Since then, I've been using it at night as an all-over moisturizer. It doesn't clog pores & does a good job of moisturizing. But I wouldn't say that it repairs or improves wrinkles - I haven't noticed any improvement in my skin over a month of using it. I'm 40, with a fair amount of sun damage, fine surface wrinkles around my eyes, deep laugh lines, and the ""elevenses"" between my eyebrows - no improvement in any of these conditions. But I'll continue to use it and night, and keep it around as a fallback moisturizer when my skin feels sensitive. I've gotten used to the smell, but not everyone will like it - it smells like a hempy, earthy lavender."
62443,2,"This product works as promised, stimulating a ""slightly puffy lip"" response within one minute or less... However, it is gone within about 20 minutes. So you will feel great walking out the door or getting a quick photo...but it doesn't last long. In my experience, a reapplication does not give the same response... unless you wait for a few hours or wash off all your lip stain or lip stick and re-apply. And, not much in the .29oz tube...for the cost.But it does exactly what it promises."
52216,0,"I recently purchased this product and I love the color of the blush it is great. But the top to get in the product sucks. It is so hard to get the top off I almost regret getting it. The packaging is so important because I am a freelance makeup artist and I need to get in and out of my makeup with ease. This blush is very hard to get into, which slows me down. So, I love the color but hate the packaging."
222326,0,Little sporty. Does not last through the day. Ok to try but not likely to buy again. Gave it three stars
163757,0,"I have very short hair, and although it's the narrowest I could find, it's really hardly usable on most of my hair."
172323,1,"This is probably one of the best shampoos in this category and at a good price. Like the smell as well (as some shampoos smell like hospital). There is a noticeable difference when you wash with this shampoo vs. standard, and it leaves your hair dryer/thicker (likely because it has no conditioner/lotion in the formula), Highly recommend"
110534,0,"I read the reviews and was hoping, honestly, for a real dramatic shimmer effect. I work on stage and wanted a really glimmery appearance. Overall, I feel that the effect is more subtle than the other reviews imply. I still like it though and got a couple of compliments on my skin.Note: the powder comes out very slowly. If your turn it over and tap, tap, tap the bottom with your application brush into the lid of the container, you can get enough out to do the job."
93695,0,"I purchased this for an Inuyasha fan, as a christmas present. Despite being notified the item would not be received until after the tholidays, the item arrived the very last shipping day before Christmas. Kudos!The product itself is nicely made. The material is soft, the head band is rigid but flexable and comfortable to many head-sizes, from our two-year old son, to my massive mellon. The ears however nicely shaped and colored, are rather small. When placed on even our 2-year old son's head they look dwarfed, as opposed to the scale of the Inuyahsa artwork, where they are rather large.Increase the size of the ears and this ould be an absolutely perfect item. But considering the whole purpose of the item is the ears, that dashes the rating down to 3."
53834,0,"I've used conair hot rollers for about 15 years. These are great, but I find it really annoying that the clips do not have a holder in the case. It is the 1st time the case does not have that. I know it sounds petty, but I can't stand that I need to get another holder for the clips."
195330,2,"I am now on my third coat, I have yet to see a change in color. True I am fair but I suspected to see something that looked like a tan. Not worth the money."
45080,2,"My Mom has suffered from rosacea for years. After using this product for a few weeks, there was absolutely no improvement in the redness or texture of her skin. She's since started using an OTC face scrub by Pond's and her face looks better than it has in years."
8451,0,"I received this package quite quickly, and it was securely and nicely packaged considering that it was only a bottle of shampoo in the package :). The product on the otherhand does not smell like garlic, which is a good thing, but I've just started using the shampoo so I still have to wait and see if the product does what it says it does. Overall, good customer service and will buy again from this seller :D"
205373,1,"When I opened the bottle, this looked a little like a brown and I am NOT a brown polish girl. Once I put it on, I was relieved and excited! Love this color!"
236154,0,Arrived fast. Barrel heats up great. Broke after the second time using it. Rubber comes off handle making it difficult to use. Disappointed.
154265,0,This product is fine as far as quality. However the description is misleading- notice the box photo it crops off one end of the applicator so you can not see if it is one tip or double tip. If you are a good consumer you want to pay an appropriate price for a product. If these were double tipped it would be a good deal. They are not. I will not be buying this again.
209629,0,"It smells nice (just like you remember) but fades quickly and isn't worth it. I bought this for something cheap to wear to work but will go back to wearing Paco Rabanne's 1 Million (way stronger and better!). Spend the extra cash, trust me."
173338,2,The lid is not secure and the rollers do not sit properly on the heating device so everything falls apart easily. The edges of the rollers get very hot so they are hard to handle.The unit does heat up quickly.
173285,2,I did not receive the product pictured. I received a round jar that says Mary Kay and the right name but inside is a pink waxy substance that is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED. Mary Kay is known for no fragrance in their skin care products and no coloring. I just want my money back now!
229974,1,"Just bought this and it is a really good product for the price. It warms up quite fast and the overall quality is good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because like other reviewers said, you have to be carefull since it does pull hair from time to time. Got my hair really nicely done in about 10 minutes. I have a LOT of hair and usually takes me around 30-40 minutes with just a blow dryer. Love the rounded edges. I looked everywhere for this feature and this was the only one I could found that had a reasonable price. Yes, the Kenta has roundes edges too, but not willing to pay $130 for a flat iron."
216561,0,The scent was nice but my boyfriend complained that the scent was just entirely too light. I had to agree.
8874,0,If you're balding then get this along with dermatend. In combination you get nice results just don't expect a miracle or something too natural. Guess it depends on your hair type and color. Tends to fade as day goes on so maybe hairspray will hold it place
66342,0,"When I purchased this about a month ago my skin was very dry with on & off flaking. I made one other change at the time I started using it - I quit using the hardwater at my house on my face and started using distilled bottled water. I think changing the water did more to fix the problem than using the serum, however when I slip and use tap water it does help releave the tightness. I also purchased the pomegranate lotion & enzyme mask a few weeks later. My T-zone started getting shiney and I started breaking out & getting clogged pores. I backed off to only using my Cetaphil cleanser and my skin seemed to clear up a bit after a week. I'm starting over again to try & figure out whether I need to return all of it or if I can use some of it. I should also mention I'm pregnant and hormones may have an impact, but I don't think that's the whole story. I'd say only purchase this if it's within your budget and make sure you can return it if it doesn't work."
171374,0,"I like the old line of mustella with ultimate hydration lotion much better ( it is discointinued )This new body lotion has a fragrant scent which I don't really care for ,because frankly I prefer very light scented lotions. It clashes with the perfume I wear."
51754,2,"I puchased both this and the matching conditioner. After two bottles of each, my hair started to feel heavy -- like I hand't rinsed it adequately, even though I know I had. I cancelled my auto ship order after two times."
219971,2,"item is shown as 6.7 OZ bottle and I received a tiny 1.7 OZ,seller is dishonest,I could have paid less for it if I wasn't fooled by the the picture and seller lies !"
66115,1,"For 21 years I've struggled to keep my unruly wavy and frizzy hair under control. I can think of two times now I've been happy with it and one of those times was when I got my hair done with this serum. I usually put my hair up to avoid dealing with it, but I look much better with it down. This product makes my waves and curls come out without the frizz/poof and smells great. I can go out now confident with the way my hair looks down and my boyfriend has even commented on how good it looks. I don't even care how much it costs. I would pay much more for it and it lasts a long time. My mom brought me to her stylist because she has similar hair (where I got it from) and she did the same thing to me as she did to mom, only a little bit different of a style. Needless to say, we both swear by this product now. It's not for straight fine hair, and it really isn't for straightening either. For thick unruly hair, it's a godsend! Thanks, Paul Mitchell!"
113655,1,"The shipping was fast.The packaging is really smooth and pretty.I really like the foggy (matte) effect when I first put it on, but it wears out pretty quickly and started chipping off little by little.The matte effect becomes unclear and shiny rather fast.I like this product in general, and it's not really expensive."
228803,2,"This texture balm leaves my hair very greasy and does not help with styling at all. Actually, does not deserve even one star :-)"
128518,0,BE is fun to wear. Just not everyday for me. My eyelids swell up. I do love the colors though.
227948,0,"The lipstick is rich in moisture and wears for a few hours. I have found, though, that the lipstick will not stay ""out"" during application. Instead it pushes back into the tube."
220087,1,"I ordered this for my daughter, who has long, very thick hair. After trying many different kinds of brushes and having only moderate success, I decided to take a chance on this one based on reviews. WHAT A BUY!!! She no longer complains when I brush her hair either wet or dry, and after a year it's still going strong! Don't look any further, this is the brush for anyone whose hair tends to knot and tangle!"
54806,0,I am very satisfied with the service I received from this company. I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one. I am very grateful for that. They were very courteous and didn't even cause me any additional costs. They are very helpful and respond promptly. Thank you for being so prompt and kind in this matter.
116513,0,This straightener is a lot better than the thin conair one i previously bought. It does heat up in 60 secs and is able tyo smoothe out my thick wavy hair. It's a good straightener for the price so i would recommended it. It's gold plated but not ceramic.
28245,0,"Mine came with a pump, but the exfoliant clumps and all I get is a watery-substance when I pump into my hand. The product definitely exfoliates well, that's why it gets 3 stars, but because I have sensitive skin I tend to break out if I use more than two times a week (which is why it doesn't get 5 stars). The exfoliation is definitely ""micro"" so you're not getting a bunch of big beads drooping down your face, and instead it stays put while you're doing your exfoliation. Overall, as far as exfoliation goes, this does a great, great job, with my face feeling very smooth afterward. Just a word of caution for those with sensitive skin, don't over-do it, and for all users out there, avoid the pump."
128578,0,"While the Red Door cologne's fragrance was lighter and more refreshing, the Red Door Eau De Parfum is too heavy and to me seems stale - not fresh like the cologne. I prefer something lighter, so won't buy this again."
144054,0,Have been using for about a week. Haven't seen any difference. But at least it's not expensive. Like the package too.
101732,0,"looks very dark, not navy to my eyes. also i cant get it to crackle like it's supposed to, even after reading how to tips and trying several methods."
178561,0,"Now that I've installed this, I'm wondering what will happen if I ever need to remove it. One disappointment: There's no place for a toothbrush."
218304,0,"The eye gel is very light, but it is absorbed well. I don't feel too much difference after applying it though."
60938,0,"Let me start by saying I have healthy, light brown hair that I bleached to pale blonde, almost white. It managed to stay in great condition even after the bleach. After reading reviews, I saw that this was a good choice to tone for an awesome natural-looking medium blonde. I followed directions EXACTLY and even left the color on as long as indicated in the instructions. The result looked as if I did nothing at all! My hair looked the exact same shade as I began with.... white! I guess it's better than a horrible dark brown or black which people sometimes come up with after coloring bleached hair. However, I did a lot of studying before attempting this so that would not happen to me. My hair is still in good condition, but now I have to RE-COLOR again after bleaching, which I'm sure cannot be good for my hair (besides the embarrasement of walking through the store like this). I must assume that this was an individual defective product...as I've used this brand before with success. But I will be using Colorsilk in Medium Ash Blonde instead after reading even more reviews.**** UPDATE **** Colorsilk in Med Ash Blonde was perfect.... healthy & shiny too. Just the right shade of blonde (somewhere between medium ash blonde & dark blonde - but most importantly NO BRASS!!"
40110,0,"I've been using a $1 fingernail clipper for about 5 years now and purchased this clipper to replace it. I first noticed the size of this clipper is slightly larger than an average clipper, but the advantages include a sharper clip, slick handle turning mechanism, and the aesthetically pleasing design. A fantastic product overall, but quite pricey compared to a $1 clipper."
251666,0,GloMinerals products cost more but the quality is there. They have unusual colors that are not offered by other makeup lines.
47205,0,"Good price point, but I'm not sure it's doing what I need for my skin. It's quite moisturizing, pleasurable to apply, and has a nice if strong scent. My skin seems to be benefiting texturally. It looks a little more lush and velvety. I, however, need more help over all with my skin tone, redness in my cheeks and some sun and old acne spots. This product makes my skin look nice, but I am not at all amazed. The Olay Definity night creme gave better results with regards to my needs and it is only a few dollars more. I will probably always use some Olay products, but this one I think is not for me."
13479,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
126844,1,This fragrance is among my favorites. I always receive compliments when I wear it. It stays fresh and clean all day.
210928,2,Pretty good scent but the handling of the product was horrible. The box was all dented and the top ripped. When i opened the box i found the cologne to be cracked but not leaking thankfully. Good scent but absolutely horrible shipping. Was not satisfied
58475,1,I GOT THIS PRODUCT TO HELP HAIRGROWTH AND ALSO STOP HAIRLOSS AND IT WORKS!THE PRICE IS GREAT IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH OTHER SELLERS AND I GOT THE PRODUCT IN THREE DAYS!!.THIS SELLER REALLY KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS.
220583,0,"When this salt is used as a hand scrub it can sting your hands a little while it dries out your skin removing any impurities or dirt in your pores. It is nice however, in a diluted bath and water solution. I used about 1 cup in a hot bath and did not receive the incredibly smooth skin I was seeking. This dead sea salt did not moisturize my skin like the stuff in the mall. I guess it's my fault for being ignorant on what to expect but... oh well. You live you learn.I give it a 3 out of 5 because it's good as bath salt but probably on the cheaper side of quality..."
189669,2,"I suspect these bands were exposed to UV or heat while in storage. Most broke immediately, the rest broke within 3 days of use. Plastic elastic braiding bands are meant to be hardy and long-lasting for binding the ends of braids. Instead, these broke more than four times more quickly than the ordinarily weaker black rubber bands I use as short-term ""break-away"" bands for the hair root. (And the black rubber bands I've been using are more than 10 years old). Extremely disappointing performance and not worth even the Amazon ""add-on"" price."
98138,0,"I bought this product last month, hoping to get rid of the acne on my upper arms and back. Well, it worked for about a week and a half or two weeks, and it cleared up my back and arms. However, it all came back, even though I hadn't stopped using the product. So I started mixing it with Dial antibacterial bodywash, and now the combination of the two works great! So overall, this is a good product, but it would be better if it were antibacterial."

11253,2,"This is not the real product, and I would guess it's a bootleg. I did not open it as I wanted to return it, but the product and packaging are quite different from the one pictured."
105465,0,"Kiss My Face is one of the few brands of products that don't irritate my skin. I've been using their moisture soap for about five years now. However, I have only used the Pear scent up until I tried this Peach scent. The scent itself was pleasant but the soap was so much thinner (almost runny) compared to the Pear scent."
227024,0,"I love love love this company. However, as someone who uses soap and lotion in place of perfume/cologne, etc., when it comes to lotions, I'm about the scent as much as the lotion's hydrating qualities. The lavender lotion doesn't have as rich a lavender scent as EO Everyday Body Lotion/French Lavender. The EO lotion sells for about 1/3 the cost of the Mistral lotion (if you buy it here, via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, but it's cheaper anywhere, really). The hydrating qualities are about the same, although the Mistral lotion does have a ""richer"" feel, going on. I'm just sharing this to help anyone else who really cares about the ""scents"" of lotions. I'm insane for the scent of Mistral's Wild Blackberry lotion, which, for some mysterious reason, has been discontinued, and also enjoy Mistral's South Seas scent."
54699,0,"Nioxin normally produces excellent products, but in this case, the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Deep Repair Masque did not meet my expectations for excellent conditioning qualities. The masque only softens hair and detangles, but doesn't add the body that I need in a repair masque. For the price of this product, it does not deliver!"
16638,0,My foot doctor wanted me to use this product. It seems to work OK.
7716,1,This was a surprise gift for my husband who loves it but thought I paid a fortune for it. He was amazed at the price. I have one happy husband.
100703,0,"I guess I was expecting a different scent. This one is strong, which is a bonus and pleasant enough, but not very musky and more of a cinnamon/vanilla smell to me."
94353,1,I've tried all kinds of dandruff shampoo and conditioners but this is the only thing that has ever worked on my dry scalp. Makes my hair really soft

136869,0,"I was excited when I read all of the reviews, and when I got it, the package is very european, I was excited to open the package. For some reason, this brush produces a lot of static when I brush dry hair (not the case with Fekkai's brush)...it does work beautifully after taking a shower, but is 100 bucks worth it? I'm not sure...I'm keeping the brush and to tell you the truth my hair looks ok but I don't think a brush is an investment, it is a cost, if you have the money, splurge, if not, you will be fine without it..."
38902,1,"I bought this because I really liked the Bijan Black, but I wanted something slightly different... it smells really good.... and now I use it even more than the Black. All my co-workers like it, and some even bought it for themselves!"
241963,0,"I liked the Aussie hair spray well enough -- it did hold my style without being too sticky or stiff, but I found the smell to be a little overpowering. At first, it has a fruity smell -- but you can still smell it hours later and it doesn't work well if you're wearing a perfume. I think I'd opt to purchase this spray with an unscented smell. Overall, the hair spray was good for the price."

238241,2,"Conair 1875 hair dryerstopped working in less than a month. The reset button won't click, so it won't start. Don't feel like the hassle of trying for a credit or return, don't have packaging. Am going to buy local where I can easily return something."
143607,1,"This was a very good product. It came wrapped well. The product itself I love to take with me in my purse so that I can smell nice any where, any time of day. Beautiful perfume is so great, because it smells lovely and is a sweet reminder that makes you feel good when you where it. I just love it and give it five stars for value, and good packing and easy to use."
224513,2,"Pros- its light weight, does what it says, dries my wet (thin but dense) hair and straigtens. It is a pretty contraption and it has adjustable heat which is nice.Cons- my Hair gets caught in the frame of it and pulled out which is both painful and frustrating. And it happens so frequently and it is such a big deal that if i had the money i would go ahead and pass it to my little sister and buy a new one.I do not have said money and it doesss do what it is supposed to so for now i can continue to use it and thats why it got a 2 instead of a 1."
40914,0,I bought three of these in September 07. They all had an expiration date of April 07.
196194,1,"I absolutley love this product. My hair is fairly straight already, but it works great to smooth my hair. I also like how you can use it to curl your hair."
44162,0,"This is okay but the other KMF shower gels are better: Silky Soft, Early to Bed, and Early to Rise are my personal faves."
39604,2,This curling iron is bulky and hard to handle. I bought it because of the ceramic tourmaline finish thinking it would leave my hair silky like my ceramic flat iron does. This product made my hair really dry. I only used it twice but probably won't use it again.
123074,2,This smelled wonderful but did not clean me at all. I ended up just using it to clean my bath tub after I took a bath. I would not buy this again!
175445,0,"Cons the cord is quite short and you can't use an extension cord. The cool heat setting is warmish too.Pros if you don't use the highest heat setting at all this is a very good dryer if not better, excluding it's thormaline lack. The cool setting is about warm the warm is hot and the high hot is steaming and after about a minute smells like somethings burning. I have found that to be true for any ceramic not thormaline dryer I have tested/tried on high settings particularly on high speeds. I didn't use the hot but I did turn on the highest hot setting for a couple minutes for this review. The bottons aren't the easiest to turn on and off but there not that bad either. I highly don't recommend using the high heat not only for your hair but because it harms your skin also even if you can't see/feel the skin damage.There is a fairly unique accessory that could be good but I'm not certain of it's usefulness- it is the hair straightner, smoothining one.It is certainly lightweight, but if you can afford to spend $8. more I'd recommend the RevlonRv544 with free shipping on here or any other thourmaline dryer. This conair dryer used as I mentioned shouldn't damage your hair (Unlike cheap non ceramic dryers that will. Thourmaline in my mind is a higher quality ceramic) but it won't give you added benifit or make your hair healthier like Thourmaline is proven to do.P.S. If your interested the number 1 reason I bought this is for it's three heat settings and overall value as a backup 2nd dryer. My first dryer I still use as my main one I love the 3 heat settings rarily if ever using the high heat for my normal long hair and sensitive skin and scalp. My first one is Thourmaline and better and I was okay with that staying that way. I returned this because of it's cord length mostly. But, I wouldn't be surprised at all if conairs strength doesn't rely in there hair dryers. My other dryer is from Remington but not lightweight unfortunatly."
91713,0,"I have heard so much about Carol's Daughter's products and I had been wanting to try something from the line. I am African American and I do hair professionally. I have very long thick hair that constantly needs moisture. I want to address the smell : It is very VERY bold. It is not so much unpleasant as it is loud. If I were sensitive to smells I'd definitely have a problem with this product. I would apply it on a weekend so that it would calm down before returning to work. It doesn't really do a whole lot for my hair unless my hair is wet and the instructions is for it to be applied to the scalp---but I don't like clogging my scalp with ointments. It works really well on my daughter's hair and her hair is finer and a smoother texture than mine. I don't really see the benefit for people with TRULY ""nappy"" hair to use this. I will probably continue to buy for my children and for me to use after a shampoo."
192568,0,"Was not pleased with color. Hard to tell real color on screen. Oh well, I'll use them sometimes."
97818,2,"Before you buy this, I highly recommend you do some research on its active ingredient, hydroquinone. Although the FDA claims there is insufficent evidence to link hydroquinone to cancer, Japan, the European Union, and Australia have already banned it from their products.Just be safe, and make an educated descision."
72141,2,This was fairly ineffective. I applied this as prescribed. Saw no results and ended up throwing out the bottle.Be happy with your skin or skin tone.
216694,0,"This is a great product, but the delivery service failed. Luckily DHL is no longer in service, so it should not be a problem."
78271,0,"The product does make your hair feel better, but there isn't enough in one bottle to do the job. I have short (2"" - 3"") hair, and one bottle did not cover my hair. The design of the nozzle is terrible. The product is the thickness of a thin gruel and won't flow through the nozzle. I had to cut the nozzle half-off to get it to go through. As per the instructions, you put it on damp, towel dried hair, and one person can't get it to go on evenly. I missed spots. Since your hair is already damp, you can't tell where you put the product (also, since you have plastic gloves on, you can't feel it either). It is expensive for what you get. Unless you have a very, very short hair, one bottle isn't enough. Manufacturers: change the consistency to a thicker paste and put in a tube like toothpaste,so that you can squeeze it all in a plastic applicator to you can add water to it to make a more liquid product. As is it, doesn't cover your entire hair. It has is a pleasant, non-henna smell, and didn't make my head itch. Redesign the bottle, make the product ""runnier"", and it will be OK."
200179,1,"I've been all over when it comes to colognes. Ranging from the regular Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Tommy, and various Avon types that my Mother has gotten as demo's and/or very cheap being a rep. Each of the above brands I have tried varying types from each and many more that I cannot name at the moment.Anyways, to the thoughts on the actual product... It has a very pleasant that reminds me a lot of cinnamon. I can best describe its power by using this analogy, say you spray a very heavy dose of 5 sprays. Now with other colognes your going to be asked to leave the room, with this cologne its more potent but not as offensive. For example, say someone lights 5 candles vs spraying 5 cans of aerosol air freshener.If your looking for something that everyone in your office will know what your wearing when you pull into the parking lot then this isn't your fragrance. If on the other want it to be noticeable when you sit down by the people beside you then this is your fragrance. I would consider this a much sweeter and milder version of the regular Hugo by Hugo Boss that is so popular. Another similar but slightly spicier smelling cologne you may wish to consider if you like this is Lacoste Pour Homme By Lacoste. Another favorite of mine in my picky collection.Hope this helps!"
216037,0,"These rollers are the perfect size/amount. Two issues, the rollers do not heat up in one minute like advertised, takes around 3 - 4 minutes. They also are extremely hot to the touch but do not burn your head once in. Curl very well."
75196,1,"I can't say enough positive things about Plantlife soaps.I came to natural soaps for a very specific reason--a husband whose eczema was virtually out of control. For years, we'd tried keeping him on soaps designed for sensitive skin. While this would generally calm flare-ups slightly, it wouldn't prevent them from creeping up again. Admittedly, since beginning to use Plantlife's soaps, my husband is NOT eczema free... BUT his skin is drastically improved and his flare-ups are down to about 10% of what they once were.The scents of Plantlife's soaps are remarkably pleasant too. I've yet to find one that is offensive to my nose--they're delicately done, not over-powering or too ""perfume-y.""So if you're thinking of switching to herbal soaps to treat your skin to the best, most natural clean possible--try some Plantlife soaps. If you're simply looking for some aromatherapy or some way to mix-up your usual soap routine--try some Plantlife soaps. I'd be willing to bet that if you returned to ""normal,"" store-bought soaps afterwards, you'd do so grudgingly and reluctantly!"
238436,0,"Shipment was very quick, packed very well in the box.First, the bottle is not the best container for this particular oil, don't leak but when pour outside get oily.Second, not easy to be absorbed by the skin sits on skin for long time. The most important thing is that make my eyes irritated. At the beginning I was thinking that somehow I have some in the eyes, last night I just massage my cheeks with the oil and my eyes start burning, same as before. Now I have to use it only for my hands and body, no face."
114682,2,I have had this dryer a few years now and I rarely use it due to its poor performance. It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly. You have to keep turning and twisting your head to get some of the air to blow on each quadrant of your head. The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably. Do not buy this product!
79451,2,"I have worn Provocative perfume for several years and was sorry that I can no longer find it in the stores. I did order some from Amazon last year with no problem. What I received this year was NOT Provocative. Same bottle, same box, different content. The Provoative I have been using is clear...This is amber. This fragrance is mild, though not offensive...but it is not Provocative. Who knows what I really received. I would send it back but it is too much trouble. I am disappointed!"
136375,2,The title says its Burberry for Women --- but my wife handed back to me Christmas morning with a smirk - Thanks Amazon.....J
454,1,"Eucerin sensitive skin face lotion with SPF 30 protection is a great product. However, it is extremely difficult to find in local stores (Rochester NY)---thus the reason for ordering it on-line and having to pay substantial postage. This lack of local availability is causing me to explore other substitute products. Although most other Eucerin products seem to be available, this is not the case for this 4 fluid ounce face lotion. If the situation remains unchanged, I will no longer be a customer."
239674,0,"This is Ravish Me Red by Revlon Super Lustrous, #654. It has a beautiful package and looks a gorgeous and vibrant red; HOWEVER, my daughter has olive undertones and I have blue undertones and this was just about the worst color either of us have ever tried on...appeared VERY ORANGE ON~! Now, regarding the product as a whole: It goes on silky smooth and is very blendable. There is a lot of product here for the money and the lipstick did NOT bleed into the skin around my mouth. It may have come off a little too easy; you would definitely have to reapply it if you eat or drink anything. So, I would strongly suggest that you try the color before buying if possible and know what the undertones are in YOUR skin before buying!"

218996,1,"Just started a new bottle of Tuscany.It has become a different colour, now greener than the previous golden shade. Not a problem.However the fragrance has changed too. The lemon element has beem reduced considerably which in turn reduces the spring like freshness to something much heavier.I think after about 20 years of constant use Aramis have lost my custom as I am far from sure that I like this version."
42663,2,"bottles have to be under three ounces to pass airport carry-on security. too bad. be careful, or they'll take your products."
153191,0,Good cologne but it is taking a couple of weeks to get to my house as I write this. For such a small item it should not take so long
118568,1,Wife loves this product and I love that it is much less costly buying in this quanity. It actually is split up among a couple of households.
135250,0,I've used this several times since I purchased it. It's very basic but works pretty well. Good for the price.
225051,0,This straightener is ok. It says you have to wait 6 to 12 min. but its takes longer. The straightener makes your hair un-frizzy if you use the proper shampoos.
144238,2,"And again I went by all the good reviews instead of going out and smelling it. Not for younger people, and again I was to lazy to return it now its just sitting in my bedroom for looks. Go out and smell it before you buy it, I will!!"
134303,0,it was not bad but just soso. the texture was ok but not keeping my skin mostrized over hours. it smells very artificial. wont buy again.
148442,2,I thought being the brand as well known it would be ok to order on line but it is most unsatisfactory. It barely heats at all and I don't know whether it just doesn't work or a bad product Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter I had to check on star on the rating but it deserves none.
135011,0,"I have thick, long hair and a lot of it. I wish they made a larger set of these rollers. They take a little longer than I would like to get super hot. I never have much luck with rollers....So it may just be me."

32802,1,I am very satisfied with the product.It does what it says.Price was good and I received it quickly.What more can you ask for? Thank you
143346,0,I bought this hair I was shocked when I got the hair because the color was really off I thought I ordered dark hair but it was kind of reddish or Oberon hope I spelled that right I have never tried color but took a chance it turned out okay but I think the color chart needs to be changed because the picture looks like dark hair and it was totally off wouldn't mind buying more but afraid that it will be the wrong color I did get it really fast so Thanks Amazon 3 stars are for color mistake
83240,1,"This product is great I use it every day avidly. I thought I'd go online and save a few bucks....BAD IDEA!!! This seller took FOREVER to get it to my home. I was about to go and buy it at the store... I can't believe how long I waited for two lil bottles of sunblock. Next time I will not hesitate walking into Target and paying a few extra dollars. But as far as the product,I swear by it. I can't use any sunscreen that makes me break out, and thats all but this oil free one."
93612,0,"I loved the Sunforgettable in the miniORB, so I bought this brush to try it since it seemed like a convenient idea. Using the brush, I discovered that most of the sunscreen ended up in the air around me (that I then breathed in and proceeded to cough for a few hours) and very little of it on my face. I much prefer the ORB or the large can as a result. The powdered sunscreen itself is very good and doesn't cause any breakouts (even on my acne-proned face) and provides great sun protection (I'm a dermatologist so this is important of course). The brush is a good idea that fails during implementation though. There is also no good way to clean the brush (the alcohol solution sold on the site doesn't work very well)."
180791,0,While the product seems okay its way overpriced for the quantity. I mis-read this and thought it was 20 ounces not 1.5oz.
242894,1,"I have extremely sensitive skin and this line of products really works for me - I've been using Philosophy products for about 2 months, and noticed a huge difference right away. I'd given up on finding any product that I could use successfully. I first used it when my girlfriend recommended it while our families were on vacation together and she let me try it out for that week. Omigosh! What a difference! Best way to describe it is that my face felt clean and ""balanced"". For the first time I could use a cleanser and not have a bad reaction. And the other products in the line are great too - Philosophy Hope In A Jar Therapeutic Moisturizer For Dry Sensitive Skin has to be my favorite! Highly recommend."
157927,0,I really did like this product. It arrived quickly and the quality is very high.
251711,1,"I am 42 years old and have tried as many foundations in those years. My skin is oily/combination and is beginning to sport fine wrinkles. I have always had trouble finding a foundation that matches my skin color, provides adequate coverae, and does not break me out. THIS IS THE ONE! I was skeptical that a ""powder"" could really provide such beautiful coverage, but with practice I have learned how to achive a flawless finish that does not look heavy or cakey. Be aware that this foundation is very different from liquid and I did have to do it a few times to get the hang of it. The effort was worth it. If you order it, don't get discouraged if you do not like it at first. Chances are, you just need to practice buffing and blending (or you have used too much). You will love it once you ""get it."""
192876,2,"I was very excited to recieve this base coat. I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older. I would never purchase this product agaian. This base coat does not keep my polish on, and it creates not barrier for my darker polished. I put this on and then painted two top coats and my nails were still stained red from the polish. I am very dissatisfied."

115813,0,Good for shine but the product isn't all natural product for the most part it's a good product. Great shipment
8452,0,I can't really say personally how this product works as they have been gifts to my sisters who live abroad. But as far as I know they're seeing some results.
157795,0,"This is a pretty great product. The tan looks nice and natural, no matter how thick you lather it on. And it's a great moisturizer too. Some people complained about the smell, but I honestly didn't notice anything different from a regular daily moisturizer. The shimmer is a nice touch. It really looks great.HOWEVER, and this is a big however, if you manage to get wet while wearing clothes (even just a bathing suit) it'll rub off. I went to an amusement, rode maybe 4 water-based rides, and by the end of the day the spots that were hit by my clothes were my original skin color. AND it doesn't even come off evenly. It comes off splotchy, so it looks like you have some sort of skin disorder. Sweat will do it too. So don't intend on spending time in the heat, especially if you insist on doing so with clothes on. The same issue can be achieved after a shower or bath if you rub your skin too roughly with the towel. Basically, you have to baby the tan like nobody's business because if you don't, you'll find it rubbing off in some spots. Pale isn't half as bad as being spotted."
73358,0,"This is okay. I would not buy it again because for the price it did not make my hair feel any different than some other store brands. Smells great, but smell alone will not make me spend the money."
129635,2,this was not a good product. It was very greasy and did not help me at all. I would not buy it again.
34302,0,I love most Suki profucts but the smell of this oil is hard for me to get past. The 'balancing' oil is amazing and smells delightful.. Ordered this 'nourishing' oil by mistake but decided to keep it.. It doesnt absorbas easily and again.. Thesmell is awful (although it does go away quickly After applcation)
5335,0,i bought this for scar cover up and tattoo cover up. It was too pale as I had to add another foundation on top of it which was an added expense.
70639,2,"I've had scalp psoriasis for decades, causing chronic itching and scaling on the lower back part of my scalp. I've tried many medicines, shampoos, lotions, etc and have found a few that are effective. Unfortunately, the best treatment for me is a prescription topical medicine that is kind of expensive (a compounded prescription strength product called DermaZinc which is available in non-prescription and prescription formulas, the stronger is far better). Looking for less expensive alternatives, I tried Dermarest shampoo. Bottom line is that is doesn't help much. I noticed only a very slight improvement in the scaling and flaking, but not enough. I have used salicylic acid-based solutions before (like this Dermarest) and they do a pretty good job of reducing scaling, but to be very effective the solution must remain on the skin for a longer period of time, such as overnight. I think that this shampoo simply isn't in contact with my skin long enough to do much - I can only shower for so long! I'm encouraged to see some reviewers finding help with this, but sadly for me it is not effective enough."
248240,0,"i bought this for a friend, and the first thing he said was how great the bottle looked. but the scent doesn't really follow. i was a little bit disappointed. i like Bvlgari cologne but this one is a little bit too strong. next time i'll make sure i can try it before i buy a cologne, for me or anyone.

I left the rollers in while I went to make a sandwich (about 15 minutes because I was cooking bacon too), then I went back and took them out. My hair came out a bit wavy- that's all. It looks nice but I expected that it would have a lot more curl to it. I will try again, this time, leaving the roller on the steam a bit longer and update soon."
170038,0,"The polish is a beautiful color, but it dries matte and is very thin! I was expecting it to be better."
114721,2,doesn't smell like the original heaven scent nor does it stay with you..sent disappears after a while. Have to reapply
102380,2,"International shipment.I bought six bottles and they were all a little open, and spilled for the whole box.the packages arrived without another packaging. dirty and without hygiene, disappointing"
104758,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."
98216,2,I bought this product for puffiness underneath my eyes and crows feet. I am on week 2 and it looks like my puffiness has gotten worse. The puffiness had gotten so bad I became embarrassed to leave the house. It did nothing for my crows feet.
203762,2,"If I am spending $28 on a bottle of shampoo, I shouldn't have to wash my hair every day. The day after shampooing, my hair would get dull and greasy and I would have to pull it back. On the day I shampooed, there wasn't a real significant difference between Wen and the Dove shampoo & conditioner that cost $4. Sure, my hair looked good, but not better, and it still required the same amount of styling and straightening. I was looking for something that would make a significant improvement to my thick, frizzy hair without a lot of work, but I definitely didn't find it in Wen. Severely disappointed."
96903,2,"For 2012 Queen Helene has changed this product entirely (both packaging & formulation), without letting you know.The ads on Amazon still show the prior packaging so you have no clue that what you are buying is a completely different product. Therefore, you should ignore all of the pre-2012 reviews.I used the original version for 20 years and loved it.This new version is terrible with a pungent fragrance that is simply horrible.Queen Helene/Amazon need to get their act(s) together and stop running a misleading photo showing the original product.I wasted my money on a six-pack. I wish I could just get the original formulation again."
56196,2,"If you like Musky smells, you'll like this. I Hate it but that's me.Gave it to my Mom she loved it. If you like floral/ powder/ fruity smells you wont like this."
110294,0,"I've used this scent on and off for over 10 years and I swear this is not the same! Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredient that MAKES this scent seems to be missing!?"
111762,2,I have had this curling brush for a total of 4 months before the fan blew out and the burning element nearly burnt through base. I don't reccommend. It worked good for the four months but should be able to last longer that 4 months.
121518,0,"I honestly loved everything about this conditioner. Except the fact that it left my hair looking as flat as usual. It smelled wonderful, and left a nice smooth feel to my hair, but it didn't volumize it. That was kind of disappointing. Maybe it will end up working for you though. Anything is possible."
171015,0,its a pretty nice color. theres some really subtle silver shimmer/ sparkles in it. its kind of really streaky lol. but if u apply with care itll turn out really nice. it takes about 3 coats to make it opaque.
245459,1,Have used it for over 15 years and I have never had a wrinkle ( Just kiding about the wrinkles) Not oily and has a little SPF and just enought tint to make you look healthy. Cant always find this in the stores any more
116841,2,Don't waist your money!You will never get a professional manicure with this item. It works as it pleases and you may find yourself with a half manicure.
131638,0,"THE CK WAS FINE, BUT THE PLASTIC TUBE FOR THE ATOMIZER WAS MISSING. FORTUNATELY, WE COULD USE TUBE FROM AN ALMOST EMPTY CK BOTTLE.. DELIVERY PROMPT"
57637,2,"The original formula of this product was great - gave my hair texture and lift like no other! Then, they changed something in the ingredients and now it's worthless. Not as sticky and has no hold like before. My hairdresser refuses to buy this &#34; new&#34; version of texture twist and has many disappointed customers because of it! Will not buy this again unless they go back to the original formula."
217205,2,Product was so-so; not worth the price. Didn't seem to make any difference in the war on frizzy hair.
162946,1,Same scent as Reaction. Most women love it and wanna get as near you as they can. Need I say more?
33478,0,"I like this fragrence a little bit. It's alright smell. I could deal with it ,not bad. I will stick with the White Diamond fragrence."
86957,0,"For anyone suffering from chronic bacne, I'd recommend getting a decent scrub brush and some medical grade anti-bacterial soap, such as Hibiclens. For everyone else, I'm sure this product works just fine with regular use. Pleasant smell, too."
173639,2,"I used both the Nioxin Cleanser and the Scalp Therapy Conditioner. I would not purchase or use these products again. The medicinal smell is almost intolerable. I really do not want my hair to smell like medicine. When the shampoo gets on my skin, it irritates my skin (just try to wash your hair without getting the shampoo on your face when you rinse off the shampoo). I did not feel it helped my hair at all, which has thinned over the years. I do not believe there is anything in this product that has been proven to actually ""grow"" hair. It probably has ingredients to make the hair ""look"" thicker. I really did not like these products. What has helped greatly to make it seem as though I have more hair on my head are volumizing shampoos and mousses. And, they smell much better!"
20155,1,"I tried many products to cover the line on my lower chin, upper neck area....and nothing really worked. After many internet searches I found this product with lots of good reviews.... I tried it! It is GREAT! Be sure you put it on by 'patting'. I apply my other face make up first, then pat on the leg magic, and pat/blend the two areas that meet. Works great! The line is gone, goes through hot summer days of golf and sweating. It is hard to find your 'color', but well worth the experimenting of different colors. At first I ordered a light color and darker color and blended them, but eventually found the right shade. I have used it for 8 years in this manner."
69889,2,"I have used molding mud for at least 20 years and have always loved it to help hold my curly hair and to reduce frizz. However, the last few years I can tell they changed the formula or something is occuring that causes small hard pieces to be present throughout the mud. When you apply you can't avoid having them visible in your hair. Occasionally you can find it without the hard pieces, but more often than not they are there. I tried writing to the company and haven't received a response or acknowledgement. It is a shame because I can't find a product similiar to this that works as well. Matrix just came out with Fiber Shuffle which is a little stickier and is good-but not quite the same effect."
140866,1,"My husband ordered this perfume for me. It arrived two days back, and its really really great. It smells so good and i just love it!!!"
151595,0,"of course the color you get not same as on box. If hair is natural black, color will be orange at first then in a week or so color will adjust. If trying to cover grey will need to leave on for the maximum time allowed. The shipping cost is exaggerated and can be duly avoided by a simple local purchase if able"
234868,2,"Slight disclaimer, I have been using Bare Minerals for the past 3 years and was looking for a powder that would give better coverage (I am prone to pimples and have a lot of freckles). One thing this powder is GREAT for is coverage...which is good, because after using this for a few days, my face broke out and has been a train wreck ever since. I just switched back to Bare Minerals and am already seeing an improvement.Bottom line...don't use it!"
64903,2,The first time put the product on I had to almost immediately remove it because of the smell. I have never used a lipstick that smelled this bad. I think the product is old.
103654,2,"I have used the tea tree oil cleansing pads and fell in love! My skin was never as clear as it was while using this amazing product! When it came time to reorder, I ordered 2 knowing that I would definitely use them all up. The problem is, when the product arrived, it was in a new package. This jar was white whereas my old trusted product came in a brown jar with brown lid and green label. I figured that it must be the same product only in a different packaging.....WRONG!!!!!!!! The pads were dried out, the smell was different, and there was no tingle on my face telling me it was working. I compared the ingredients from the old packaging, and found slight variations but the end product is completely different in my opinion. I need to find the old product again in the old packaging. I will be contacting the seller."
57213,1,"I have been using this product for years and it is one of the best ever. However , ONE TREE IS overpricing it. Well , I guess I have to move on and find another brand. Good luck to all."
207503,0,"I've used Kiss My Face liquid moisturizing soap as a hand soap everywhere in my house for several years, but this new formula seems less moisturizing. I wash my hands and forearms a lot because of my work. The previous formula always left my skin in great condition. After using the new product for a week, my skin is more dry. Also the new style of pump (and/or a thinner soap consistency?) cause the soap to overshoot my hand sometimes, splattering on the floor or wall. But the main issue is I'm not pleased that the soap seems less moisturizing. The previous product was perfect. I wish it were still available. Now I have to go looking for another brand that does the same moisturizing job as the previous Kiss My Face formula did."
122066,1,"Only need a little bit, it goes a long way.. works, tightens and I noticed a difference in a few days. saw it on Dr Oz and tried it.... I am a HUGE reader of reviews before I buy things and that was the reason I tried it"
11484,0,They do the job for the most part. I like the pointed tip that makes it unique over just a regular qtip.
38997,1,"Bill Blass for Women is clean and classic. It works for day and evening, and it's the one I've chosen as a signature fragrance. The product is subtle and modest but not cheap; an added bonus is finding it at a discount price."
212587,0,I was thrilled to find Gianfranco Ferre! I love the perfume and it smells as wonderful as I remember. However this particular bottle was a disappointment as the atomizer bottle doesn't work and leaks all over my fingers when I use it - wasting the cologne. I would still get this again in hopes that every now and then it's just the bottle and not the fact that I bought it on line.
51936,1,"Pianoman is right, you absolutely should give this cologne a shot, it's the one and the only among I know of."
173662,1,I love Nioxin and was thrilled to find I was able to order it. I have used it for several years and the System 3 is very gentle to your color. I have dark blonde hair. Nioxin helps my hair feel thicker and really seems to invigorate my scalp. It was shipped right away and I am very pleased with everything about this transaction.
218108,1,"Great product. Reminds me of Dr. Bronner's old Peppermint soap that I used to use when back-packing. Felt like your scalp was on fire..., in a good way (I miss the commentary on those old bottles). This shampoo seems a tad milder and is bracing enough to be part of any full-blooded wakeup ablutions. I look forward to using it every day..., just one of those things that enriches a day."
23496,2,"This iron worked very well for about 4 months. Unexpectedly the cord stopped working and I was no longer able to use this flat iron. I have used Sedu in the past but this model was terrible, unless I just got a lemon."
100798,2,"I bought this scent because of the enthusiastic reviews, and according to the manufacturer's website (Auric Blends) it's wildly popular. I bought the roll on and wanted very much to like it, but, unfortunately, this one is not for me. I was expecting a warm, powdery, floral musk and instead I get a very sharp, watery (muguet?), floral with no soft, warm musky tones at all. Unfortunately this type of scent gives me headaches. Way too much of a bite! It's too bad- I was really looking forward to wearing this scent. (maybe I got a bad bottle? or maybe it was mislabeled?) Not for me, thanks!"
94963,1,Recently I have had difficulty finding this product in salons and retail stores so was delighted to find this source. The delivery service was good.
170181,1,This is my favorite color and my favorite nail polish. I liked it so much I didn't want to take it off. I had it on for 3 weeks.
210827,0,"This one isn't going to turn heads, it's just a light, average, but pleasant scent. I think it resembles Curve Chill only with a presense of lime, the sandlewood doesn't really grab me either. Curve Appeal and Curve Crush are better choices."
144497,2,"After reading the other reviews, I thought the redness and itching and dryness would be temporary. Two weeks in of use as recommended, I'm giving up. This stuff is awful. My chin looks like chicken skin.It made me look younger, alright. But because it broke me out so badly I look like a teen entering puberty.Horrible.Going back to Philosophy products."
44308,0,Good News: The fragrance is wonderful! I wish there was body lotion to use with it. Bad News: It's too thick and does not lather well. Improve on that and you have a great bath and shower gel. I also used it in the bathtub and it didn't lather up.
220285,1,I love it! Its so gentle and brushes easily through my very long and very thick hair. Its excellent for wet and dry hair! It would be wonderful for children as its so gentle and soft. My favorite brush ever!
59387,1,"I was very skeptical of this due to all the ""Hype"" But I was pleased to be wrong. It works wonderfully.. I got the peppermint which should come with a will ""tingle"" or even burn sensitive skin.. Tip for ladies, a few drops in a cup of warm water makes a great makeup brush cleaner..Tip for the guys, 10 to 20 drops in a bucket washes the car amazingly.I love it at a face wash that tingles and makes your skin feel so clean. I use it with my clarsonic face brush."
237697,1,"Super good deal! This stuff works really well, the peppermint is really refreshing (just watch the eyes) and it's mild enough for super sensitive skin too. My husband uses the Peppermint, my daughter uses the Baby and I am in love with the Lavender."
162825,2,"Back when this sponge was only $2, it was a good deal, especially for pushing your cart total over $25 for free shipping. The price is currently almost $5 now, so I wouldn't even consider it unless the price dropped. You can get a pack of 3 at a well known department chain store (BB&B;) for around $6, and quality is either the same or better (not sure if the three-pack is still available). The sponge itself is decent, though I find it rather small.Edit (2/9/13): Holy cow, thirteen bucks for a single loofah?!? Just dropped review by a star (probably too generous). Price gouging by Amazon is getting ridiculous! I recommendAquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)if you want to go cheap. Although the Aquasentials unravel easily and aren't super high quality, it's decent for a little more than a buck a piece."
35967,0,NOt hte best for color match... pretty if you add a pearlized topcoat to it... Does not last if you don't have a top coat... Easily chips ( when topcoat is not present) Resembles paint... SHAY is better than the Minka
121512,2,"This gel conditioner did not work on my long, thick colored hair. It seemed to add MORE tangles to my hair! It was difficult to work through, difficult to rinse, and then impossible to comb."
228876,1,Love this color and the entire line of HiColor. I use a level 40 developer and always get a brilliant color with no brassy tint. I've been using it for about 7 years now and it's been great and consistent. Highly recommend this product.
81913,0,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Pink Sugar! This was the first time I ordered the hair perfume, and when it's empty I will go back to actually spraying the EDT in my hair. The silicone makes my hair feel soft, but does not add much for shine. Nice enough, but nothing near the EDT."
16557,0,"I had received a bottle of Jess as a present many years ago and had been looking to replace it for some time but was unable tofind it in any of the local stores. So when I found it on the internet was elated but unwilling to spend the purchase price for a large bottle without trying it again to see if the scent was as I remembered. It was not. Although I enjoyed the very mild scent, I would not purchase the normal size bottle."
250157,1,"I put on make-up everyday. I am one of those people who, WITHOUT A DOUBT, needs a make up mirror that not only magnifies my face ENOUGH, but also gives me enough LIGHT to see what I am doing. I went on the search for the ""perfect mirror"" about 2 years ago after my ""CLAIROL"" died and was no longer manufactured. I bought and tossed three mirrors before landing on the Jerdon. I have since purchased 5: One for my home, one for my summer home, one for my RV, and one for each of my daughters. IT IS AWESOME! BUY!BUY!BUY! You will love it."
183780,1,"This dryer is great, cuts drying time by at least 30% for me! Yes its a bit heavy, but if you've used professional level dryers before you will hardly notice. I pair it with a ceramic brush and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I have super thick long wavy hair - and this is powerful enough to get the job done. I got a Solano in 1999- and used it for 12 years - and this babybliss - at this price - leaves my old dryer in the dust!"
211436,1,"If you're looking for a cologne that is subtle and has a bit of tang to it, this is the one for you. My only real critique is that this isn't a great cologne for the summer. I have a tendency to sweat a lot in the summer and when the cologne mixes with sweat, it's not a very favorable outcome. It's probably not a good scent for very active people."
143476,0,I surprised by the high ratings. I don't think this product curls my lashes much at all. It seems a little squatty and doesn't open very wide. Would not buy again.
68942,1,"I have used Brut after-shave when I was younger, and I have not used any after shave for many years. I came across this one quite by accident at Amazon, and based on my past experience with Brut, I ordered it immediately. I was very pleased (and so was my wife.) Even my sons liked it, which I consider to be quite amazing. (They generally shy away from any personal product I use, assuming it must be old-fashioned.)Give it a shot, it has a unique and a refreshing smell, and best of all it does not linger around too long."
149043,0,"This is the first flat iron I've bought and I was not impressed. I have wavy hair and while the iron does straighten it somewhat, it still leaves my hair wavy. It definitely doesn't leave my hair shiny and it does seem to damage it, making it look dull and dry even though I use a spray made for flat irons to protect my hair."
40873,0,"This vendor is not selling one, but SIX fragrances on this page. They are different enough that liking one doesn't say anything about whether or not you'll like the others.The main fragrance, (1)Eau Des Merveilles, is citric, salty, ambery, very woody and a little green, and makes a statement. Some feel it's a bit unisex. However the 1 oz. size sold here is (2)Eau Clair des Merveilles, and is a gentle, orange/vanilla powdery scent w/ a touch of woods, aimed at tween girls. The 1.6 oz size is the limited edition (3)""La Tete dans les Etoiles"" from 2008 which I haven't smelled, but since they gave it a different name and different (blue) packaging, you can be sure there's a discernible difference in the scent. The ones in the eau de parfum strength are actually a very different fragrance called (5)""Elixir des Merveilles"" which reduced some of the notes in the original and added vanilla, caramel, and chocolate for a very gourmand scent. Even the pure perfume, marketed as (6)""extrait"" in the original French is a stronger, more formal scent w/ a touch of the signature Hermes leather note.As the vendor, who brags about their knowledge of perfume on their vendor page, doesn't seem to be able to distinguish one from another, it is tricky to know for sure what you'll wind up with. I don't believe I'd risk the not inconsiderable cost to buy from this page."
24723,2,"Sadly, the product was never received by the person I asked the cologne to be shipped."
89942,1,Quality and price were very good.Cap on bottle was loose and 1 quarter of the bottle had leeked into the packaging when it arived.
201845,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
87030,2,I didn't really like them. They stayed on well but didn't really do anything for me. I'm glad I tried them but I don't think I'd ever purchase them.
136107,0,"I order two bottles Lather Bamboo Creme Moisturizer, 8-ounce bottles, the pumps on both bottles did not pump had to take pump caps off and shake bottle upside to get the creme out."
227739,0,I bought this to try to tame the frizzy side hairs near my temples and ears that stick out when I wear my hair up. It doesn't do the job that I needed it to do. The fragrance is okay but not as fresh as I would have liked.
128797,2,it did not smell the same and what it did smell like it did not last.
157293,0,That they were new? clean? packaged nicely? See through? decently priced? I mean really! There just isn't a lot I can brag about here folks.
166274,1,"This lotion is good, moisturizes really well and my tan was great! I wasn't crazy about the fragrance, cherry."
174796,0,"Easy to apply, goes on smoothly and provides good coverage. Not noticeably different than other brands."
245730,0,"It is so-so. It is not bad, but I do not like them. Maybe it is good for kids to use."
151864,0,"I used this on nearly platinum bleached hair, and the result is a VERY pretty and Very bright shade of blue. Not green, not even a greenish blue, but pretty much blue verging into aqua. It's beautiful, and i hope it lasts, but it's not what i was expecting."
94759,1,Obsession Night is a wonderful scent - I love it almost as much as the original!
92125,0,"There are a few things I really love about this topcoat (and as a cosmetologist, I've worked with more than a few topcoats). It applies well and dries fast, it's super shiny and creates a great acrylic nail effect. If you like the acrylic nail look but don't want to actually have false nails then this product works well. I've been using it over my French manicure done with Essie polish.Unfortunately, as many other reviews on this product have mentioned, this top coat has a problem with cracking. It seems to be almost too acrylic-like, and thus very brittle. It does not chip, as promised, but after a few days your polish will be so crackled - just like when furniture has that fancy antiqued crackle effect.I find it does best when you apply one single thin coat, it will last a few days and will be very tough & shiny. As your nail flexes and experiences normal wear, however, just know in advance this top coat will crack. Additional coats, in my experience, only have made the cracking worse.If they could just fix this one small issue, this would be a perfect top coat. Unfortunately because of the cracking issues I have to say there are better top coats out there. One of the best, in my opinion would be Creative Nail's Super Shiny High Gloss Top Coat."
18316,1,"My sister raved about the Revitalift line so I tried the men's stuff. Not two weeks later she's commenting on my jawline and eyes looking better. I thought it was in my head. I've ordered the rest of the line. Until they make a hand cream, I'm putting one in my glovebox."
35454,0,"Been using for about a month. I have not seen a dramatic difference in my skin. It does cause some redness at times. My pore size has not changed at all. I don't have many wrinkles, but a few at age 32. It may have softened them a little but I cannot tell. I will finish this since it was so expensive and hope for the best. Probably will not purchase again! You led me wrong on this one, Dr. Oz!"
57585,1,I really like this product. I have very dry nails and this really does the trick--my nails stay soft and shiny. It works great to keep my nails from splitting and breaking.
157665,0,"I had read a few good reviews of this eyelash curler and it had been recommended by a gal on a beauty discussion board I belong to, so I purchased it. My experience is that it is OK. It takes a long time to actually curl the lashes once you figure out how to. Perhaps because I have staight-as-a-board eyelashes, but the curl doesn't seem to last. It sits rarely used in my beauty drawer."
172114,0,"Its not what I thought it would look like. Matte chrome is like a gray looking cheesey plastic. Chrome.....Not! Other than the looks, it works great."
112311,2,"I'm sorry I don't think this is worth $70 IMO. When I got this in the mail I was shocked. It is so lightweight, it's like something you could have made yourself. There is static as the other reviewer stated, but that only happens to my hair when it's really straight after I've flat ironed it. When it's real straight my hair is more thin, and this brush will stir up cradle cap. However, when my hair is thick in it's natural state, this nylon brush does not go through to the scalp like they say it will.I have a $5 Goody nylon brush that works better than this. The only difference is that the teeth on this brush are closer together, whereas the Goody's teeth are a little wider. But the Goody is heavier and appears more durable. Also, it is a pain trying to keep this clean. They give you a smaller cleaning brush that works quite well, but you can't get this brush wet or have natural hair oils left in it. I won't purchase this again."
70613,0,"As one who has been covering scars for many years, this new formula does not do quite as good a job of covering discolorations. It does go on smoother but I was more concerned with coverage. If you don't have that problem though...it is a nice looking finish with great durability."
5909,0,"never really got a chance to wear it ,box was damage with the product before i could open it ...im sad because i wanted to know wht it smelled like without the box smell taking over it"
83326,2,"Plain and simple...it did nothing. I have tried many other dark circle eye creams that state ""amazing results"".Don't waste your time on this one!"
185232,1,"This is a great styling tool. Heats almost instantly and maintains heat well. Definitely worth the extra money. I tried the Hot Tools version first, because I like their Marcel irons, but it was not up to par. I've been a hairstylist for almost ten years, so I can say from experience that this iron exceeds the performance of a lot of professional grade tools. The heat proof cover is great too. My only wish is that the heat glove was included."
223277,0,Red Door has been my &#34;signature&#34; perfume for at least 20 years. This new bottle seemed to have a little more of a lilac smell than my last bottle. Maybe my imagination......maybe not.
88266,1,This is the quickest way to exfoliate and shower at the same time. I think it also helps to get your blood circulating near the skin. I always feel rejuvenated after showering with these.
181513,0,"I picked this because of the color. And, the color is true. And unlike other China Glaze, the product was quite thin, spread unevenly with the brush in the cap (although with a detail brush it came out o.k.), and required several coats for good coverage. Oh, and it's not glossy, it's a flat finish."
123914,2,I bought this after reading all the positive feedback. When I got it and put a little on I almost threw up it stunk so bad. I don't know what was in my bottle but whatever it was I sure do not want anymore of it. Whatever it was stunk me up my shirt up my hand up and I tried to wash it off over and over again but the funk would not leave me alone. Have you ever been to the zoo and stood close to the monkey cage and you start to smell that funky musty pissy smell. Well it kind of smelled like that but worse. I think someone sold me monkey piss with a hint of monkey ass cheese. Sorry Pi By Givenchy For Men but I want to attract the laidies not a female orangutan. Bye bye monkey piss. Nothing against Pi Givenchy For Men I'm sure it is a good product but I feel I was ripped off and sold a fake product.
203571,2,"It seems that all these ""wonder"" products work wonders for everyone but me. I was so hoping this product would make my hair shiny and healthy like the gals they use on their infomercials. It didn't. I'm 1/2 Japanese and my hair has always been super thick but since I've gotten older, my hair texture has definitely changed. It's coarse and frizzy and kind of wavy (and not wavy in a good way, either!). Also, the smell...to put it mildly I don't care for it...at all. It smells like really strong cherry cough syrup mixed with Vicks VapoRub. I'm sure I would like the other scents but don't want to pay for more if it's not going to give me the results they claim. I'm wondering if you only get the results if you blow dry your hair after shampooing, because I don't dry my hair. If anyone knows, I would appreciate any info. Thanks a bunch!"
228326,1,"After using various colognes throughout the years, I picked this up to try as a new scent as I was sick of my old CK cologne. I have never received more compliments on a scent than I have wearing this. Definitely good for attracting attention from the fairer sex, it is the one they grab to remind them of you. A great, long lasting scent, I use 2 sprays in the morning and it's still noticeable in the evening. It never overpowers your sense of smell. If you're considering this scent, do yourself a favor and buy it now."
131704,0,"So I've written reviews on a few Pharmagel products in the past few days, and was ecstatic about the other ones- this one is just okay. I had used it in facials at my former job for the treatment masque and really wanted to use it myself. Pharmagel claims that all of their products can work well for even sensitive skin although when both my sister and my mom came in for facials, they said it was stinging. When I used it I actually experienced the same thing, but just the first time around. The second and third time it was fine."
17248,0,"This product is only for the roots not all over color, read the box. It does cover the roots very well and lasts just as long as a whole box color but...you will have problems using all over color afterwards. For some reason I had to color my hair twice within one week to get it to take. I will not use it again."
219668,0,"I purchased this product in order to ""go red"" after a year of being a blonde. My hair was a light/medium blonde when I applied this product and at first the color was super vibrant and AMAZING. After just one shampoo, however, (and using their color shield shampoo) it faded enourmously! I was mortified! My hair looked dull (everywhere except my roots). A few days later I purchased a red color enhancing shampoo and used that but it still faded even more. My hair looked like an orange creamsicle. I ended buying a temporary hair rinse to balance it out until I can dye my hair again (I don't want to further damage it by coloring to quickly). If the color lasted more than just 1-2 shampoos this product would receive 5 stars as I did get a lot of compliments on the color before it faded."
208504,0,My dryer was too heavy for the stand so it doesn't work as illustrated. I would not recommend this product tp others.
14897,0,My husband and I love this shampoo. It smells really good and my hair was smooth and clean. We did however receive a broken pump so its hard to get the shampoo out of the bottle. I'm not sure if the box was dropped many times before we received it.
32798,2,It does not evev stick to my skin!!! How it wanna work!!! It is completely useless!!I didn't like it at all!!
220547,1,This is an old Fragrance by Lancome which has been discontinued and I was thrilled to discoverit at Amazon and to my amazement it is the same. I have received many compliments as it isso different from many of today's scents and suits me perfectly. I certainly hope it remainsavailable!
165630,0,"The only problem I find with the curling iron is the tip. It's way to small and I am constantly burning my fingers. Also, the standing part could hold the curling iron up a little higher. it must be set exactly or sometimes, the tip part of the iron rests on whatever the iron is placed on. Other than that, it is fine."
241049,0,"I'm surprised and disappointed that this is so popular. I wouldn't think this was a scent for men, except that it says pour homme on the bottle.If you like sweet fresh aquatics and your girlfriend goes both ways then this might be what you're looking for."

74062,1,This acide is very mild and didnt irrate my skin at all. I use it with another acid to get the full effect.
80122,2,"So I have extremely dry hair due to coloring and using bleach to highlight my hair. The first day I used it, it left my hair extremely dry and stringy and not to mention how brassy my hair color looked! I had used it in the shower and left in on for about 10 mins and completely rinsed it out. So the next time I used the conditioner I left it on for about 30-40 mins and rinsed it out but left a little bit in. It did leave my hair extremely soft that time but my hair color still looked really brassy and made my blonde highlights look Bleh :-( Was not really satisfied. One more thing,since I didnt rinse it out completely it left my super straight lifeless, thin hair even more lifeless. I guess this product may be good for brunettes with thick hair (no way did it work for my straight blonde hair)."

37725,1,"I wear pretty heavy eye makeup on a daily basis. I love the Smudge Pots b/c you can apply them sparingly or an enhancement effect or lay it on thick for a more intense look. They have great consistency that's easy to manipulate and the color gets deeper the more you use. Be sure to let it dry, because they can smudge (in a bad way)"
108699,0,"This has a comfortable grip and is well balanced. The barrel is a little shorter than most, making it good for travel. HOWEVER, there is no heat-sensor-dot to tell you when the barrel is ready to use. I have learned to rely on that little dot to tell me when the iron is hot (or too hot!) The barrel takes a very long time to heat up, so plug it in early."
191590,1,"I received this perfume from a family member at Christmas years ago, and fell in love with it. It has lasted a very long time, but I only use it on special occasions. I feel as though it is out of the ordinary for Escada, considering that many of their perfumes are very sweet and floral, but this perfume is such a breath of fresh air. It's the perfect clean, simple, beachy, ""fresh from the shower"" smell. To anyone who's on the fence about buying this product, please do. It's worth every penny. You'll fall in love with it, too; guaranteed."
193761,0,"I received this item and while it's a fine soap it is not African black soap. This soap is a light green, definitely not what I expected. I would not order this again."
207452,1,Product came exactly as described and very quickly. I have always had good results when dealing with this user. Loved the Henna!
221748,0,"Over the years I have used a few different shampoos, and I am now using Suave for Men. I have been using it for about the past 10 months and have been very impressed. The shampoo smells similar to a cologne which I like a lot. It does not smell like any fruit or flowers like many other shampoos. The lather is decent, it is not too weak, nor too strong. I have used it after restaurant shifts and dirty jobs, and it has done well. There were a few times that I ended up going 4 days without a shower, due to an extremely heavy work load and it did very well on those occasions. The shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning well, and leaving hair with a fresh, clean scent. I found that it also seems to help reduce and prevent dandruff. It leaves the hair with a nice soft feel too.One thing I am very happy with is that the shampoo does not add much body. I am 22 years old with brown hair that is very thick, and I do not want any extra body added like many other shampoos do. This shampoo also works very well when Suave Conditioner for Men is used. The shampoo also does not lose effectiveness over time like I have noticed with some other shampoos. Overall I am impressed."
23684,0,"clearly the item title says 22 pieces, but I only received 19 pieces with 1 hair clip, 1 neck brush, and one comb missing. Although the missing pieces won't affect my use of the clipper, it's still not a good purchasing experience."
33505,0,"I just didn't like the feel of this product. I'm really sensitive to oily moisturizers in terms of how they make me feel. Although this did a good job in moisturizing, it left my skin and hands shiny, to the point where after putting it on, touching a doorknob would make the doorknob oily. If you don't mind a moisturizer that is a bit greasy, this is the way to go! The greasiness is probably due to the sunscreen in it."
4981,0,"I am not sure it has deep-clean feature, but it seems to work to clean normally, I just don;t like the smell..."
151353,1,"I have used this product for many, many years and I panic when I am running low. I keep two bottles at home and a small bottle in my office. I spray it on my hair everyday just before blow drying. It has a very fresh, clean smell and keeps my hair from drying out. You can also use this product on your skin (it may even be edible). It's a very refreshing and cooling body spray, especially after coming inside after a warm summer day. The product is clear, sprays on like water and leaves no residue or stickiness. I LOVE IT AND WOULD NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT MY SEA PLASMA."
225149,2,"If you have thick hair don't buy this. The rollers don't hold enough hair so you would need 2 sets and when you unroll your hair it tangles easily. The curls don't last at all!! Wish I would have saved the box, they would have been returned."
135936,0,"This was my first try at organic conditioners and it works but you do need to use a little more of it in order to get the job done. i started using a leave in detangle spray so that helps. also, organics should help the environment, plastic containers (especially when theres so many alternatives) work against that. so 3 stars, -1 for having to use more, -1 for the plastic."
244202,1,"Yo utilizo este jabon, ya que sufro de alergias a los jabones normales. De todos los jabones hipoalergenicos que he probado, este es el que tiene el mejor aroma (hay unos que ni siquiera tienen). Ademas rinde bastante y genera bastante espuma."
144736,2,THIS SMELLS LIKE U RUBBING BEER ON YOUR SKIN WHO WOULD BUY THIS I DONT WANNA SMELL LIKE A JUNKY
197351,0,"Overall I'd say this was a good product. I've only had the flat iron a couple weeks and the few times I've used it, it worked very well. The only thing that makes me mad is that nowhere in the product description did it mention that this iron does NOT have heat settings. You basically just plug it in and turn it on with no control over the heat. Luckily it was hot enough to get the job done. But for simple touchups it gets too hot so I have to use an older flat iron with heat settings to prevent from burning my hair!! So, facts given, it's your call."
26531,1,Ilove this product! My 2 year old son has the cutest curls and this mikes it feel and look soft and health. Buy this and love it like I do. The serum is good to.
214165,1,i am natural and i use this product to seal my hair after i moisturize it. its very light and doesnt make my hair feel greasy
10828,1,mounted it on the wall next to my vanity and omg......what i haven't seen in a while was scary!!!!!!!!! it stinks to wear glasses 24/7 and i love this handy mirror that i installed. easy to hang and pretty clear for 7x magnification.
29973,2,"The cream does it's job well, it's moistureisez my dry skin, but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle. As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room it's good. It laves some film in the face and even if you do not perspire at all your face will be a little sweaty. It is not too bad as other creams though. Smell is ok, not roses but it is not stinky.Recently I noticed that i have headache all night long if I use this cream in the evening. I tried not to use it - no headache. Applied it again - all night long I was having a headache. I did some research and ONE of the side effects of pycnogenol is a headache. There are few other side effects the DermaE never mentioned on the product package. More information on the pycnogenol is here: [...]ALSO, pycnogenol is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding girls, and the warning is not on the DermaE package..."
30008,0,"I have not had any problems using this shampoo (hair loss, discoloration etc.) My dandruff and itching have not completely disappeared yet, however, they have significantly decreased. I do also alternate with the apple cidar vinegar treatment 3 x week."
57710,0,Honestly I don't understand how everyone keeps saying the creme isn't oily.. Maybe it's because I have sensitive dry skin but I do feel that the night creme is oily. It leaves my face looking greasy and shiny after applying it. But I can't say that it doesn't work because it does seem to moisturize my skin.. I'm sure that to some degree it is helpful in dealing with wrinkles.
156673,0,"I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
185980,0,"I like UV 15 because it protect my skin and make my face white ,but titanium oxid it has causes my face burn and it take 2 week to get use to it"
52332,0,"I was very disappointed that I received the Carolina Herrera parfum in the box with the gold dots. I thought I was purchasing the parfum that comes in the box with the black dots like in the picture. I have been hunting it in stores and I was so excited that I had found it. Although I like both types of parfum, I prefer the scent that comes in the box with the black dots. I emailed their customer service about it and requested what I am looking for, but I have not heard back from them. The picture is deceptive because they did not send the right parfum."
184333,0,"It is def neon as stated. But the picture shows the color to be pink. It is actually a peachy orange color. Its still real pretty, although I am a pink girl."
70750,1,"I love this little oil-blotting paper booklet. I use this when I'm away from home and need to remove shine from my face. It's like using oil blotting paper and powder, but it doesn't leave any noticeable powder on my face. Very handy, it barely takes up any space in my purse. Highly recommended."
171005,2,"So I needed a good white polish after my last one was out, and I didn't want to pay $10 for a good one, so I thought China Glaze was a good alternative. It was horrible. It took 3-4 coats of polish before it looked even remotely opaque and non-streaky, and the brush was so so at best. I love China Glaze, but a lot of their nail polishes differ in quality like the houses at Hogwarts. This is one of their worst formulas, and I am incredibly disappointed.However, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was solid."
136056,0,"Nothing special. It works just like every other product on the market. It dries your skin. Hasn't worked wonders on my back, though. I guess I'll finish the product. But I won't be re-ordering anytime soon."
78243,0,"This version of Heaven Scent is kind of weak. The scent is reminiscent of the old perfume, but not as pretty or potent. I like it and will use it, but I probably will not buy it again."
34014,0,"My Grandmother always wore this perfume, so I bought this for my Mom for Christmas. It seems that the bottled in Paris version has a different sent than the American version."
118371,1,"I was considering buying the expensive InfraShine flat iron, but then I read the reviews for this one, and I'm glad! I saved about $80 and this flat iron is really great. My hair stays straight (with some gel pre-straightening)and has a nice shine. I have no trouble using this flat iron and it takes only a few minutes to style my hair. I highly recommend it."
135884,0,This is thick and kind of difficult to spread throughout hair and doesn't smell that great. I've also not noticed any benefits one way or another. I'll not be buying this again.
29773,0,"I used PanOxyl years ago and it did cause some skin flaking, and I stopped using it, I only used the bar soap at the time. I just recently started looking for it againbut it did at least work, and I saw and felt the results. So after recently checking every store (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Dollar General, etc.) I have come to the conclusion they are no longer selling the item. So I was on the hunt for something that had a comparable amount of Benzoyl Peroxide and I came across ClearZit.I started using it this past week and I have extremely oily skin. At first I didn't notice any changes, and it was causing any flaking and it didn't really feel like a medication, but today, in my 4th or 5th day of using it, it has broken through my oily skin and I see that it is FINALLY working for me. I have used so many products and this is a trial period for this one, because I had initially bough Ambi to fade my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars that I have on my face. This seems to be doing the trick. I also have been using Witch Hazel as an astringent/toner for my face and using Aveeno facial cleansing pads with Salicylc Acid to wash my face. So far so good. My pimples are drying out (I had to stop putting around my eye, becuase of the thin skin and the bit of irritation)and my acne scars seem to be lightening up. I also use a sunscreen moisturizer from Aveeno with 30 SPF during the day. I will probably follow it all up this weekend with some Shea Butter I found at my local Beauty Supply to moisturize my face overnight.Hopefully this helps....someone."
132628,0,"These seem more of a novelty than anything. Each time I use them they pull more tiny hairs than blackhead gunk. They are easy to use and the slits help the to adjust to any nose. They are a bit painful to remove but it's not intolerable. I will us these up for my ""spa days"" but they aren't life changing or very effective at all. In reality my chemical peels are more effective at doing what these are supposed to do. On the plus side, they haven't caused any breakouts thus far."
215838,2,"I was skeptical on buying this b/c it's in a solid bottle, I couldn't see the product. Turns out, I was right. This is the most DISGUSTING coconut oil I have had the displeasure of trying! I can't believe another reviewer actually said, ...this oil doesn't stink. They must work for the Parachute brand :-) This smells like a barbecue? It's a very smokey flavor and the color is actually gold in its liquid state and you can't see through it like my usual brand, Nutiva. I am used to using Nutiva which tastes wonderful, smells beautiful, and is clear in color when melted (so clear, I can read a paper through it). At its solid state it's a very bright white, not gold!I love using coconut oil on my toast, however, when I used this brand this morning I had to use grape jelly on top of the coconut oil to hide some of the flavor. Even then I could still taste that disgusting smoke flavor. I didn't want to waste my toast, so I choked it down...YUCK. I bought my bottle at Wegman's Market, so glad it was such a small bottle. I'm going back to Nutiva.When buying a good coconut oil, look for unrefined, virgin or extra virgin. Cold-pressed is the best extraction method. This Parachute brand must be refined and use pretty high temperatures to extract the oil, thus the smokey flavor. Refining the coconut oil removes the coconut flavor and scent (replacing it with a smokey flavor) that most people are looking for in coconut oil.Just be aware, not all coconut oils are equal....do your research and read the reviews in order to not waste your money."
44289,0,"Works well as both a gel and bubble bath. Does not dry my skin or irritate it. All these things I have come to expect from ""Kiss My Face"". The scent seems artificial however it is not overpowering."
45910,0,"When I ordered this product from AAA Perfume Merchants, all it said was that it came without a box and perhaps not a cap. That is the way mine came, no problem. However, they NEVER mentioned it was a tester bottle. How old? Do fragrances fade over time because it did not seem to have the same strength as the ones I purchased in stores? I wrote the company to ask about this but no one ever responded. I am pleased to see that NOW they have added honest advertising, saying that these are actually tester bottles they send out. You get what you pay for!"
3438,1,This is a classic men's cologne. Just like Channel 5 it never goes out of style and the ladies always find it not overwhelming but very chic.
246058,1,"I have used Olay facial cream since I was in my teens. I am now 52 years and people tell me I look 10 years younger. This product really does moisturize your face and prevents premature aging. My skin is really great-only minor laugh lines, but other than that it feels and looks great. I get alot of compliments-and it's all due to using Olay facial cream for almost 40 years."
16203,2,"The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash doesn't lather as well as most other body washes on the market. It claims to moisturize your skin, but I couldn't tell any difference with my skin after using it. I found the scent unattractive as well."
9787,1,"I have a relatively oily face and until now, I've either dried my face out with all kinds of facial cleansers or over-moisterized it with various facial moisterizers. This is the first facial application I've used that doesn't feel like a moisture cream when it goes on and that dramatically reduces my oily complexion throughout the day. As far a wrinkle reduction, maybe so but I've been more concerned with the overall condition of my skin and this product delivers."
167152,2,"I read numerous reviews on this product, very skeptical ~ your know, almost too good to be true. But it got great reviews, lots of people said it helped their redness. So I took a chance. TO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I got bitten again!! I put it on one side of my face and compared it to the other side and absolutely no difference. I smeared it all over my face and it did not even reduce the redness slightly. So very dissappointed. My local Walgreens actually discontinued the product due to low/no sales, I should have figured out why, if it worked they would have sold it. So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!"
22919,1,"The product itself is great, smells great, makes your hair light and clean. The seller charges about $20 less than the salons in our area. The conditioner pump top arrived cracked, a little bit oozing out, and unusable. Luckily, I just switched the pump from the bottle that just finished or I would have been sol. A little better packing next time, I hope."

33585,0,"I bought this product because it got rave reviews from all sorts magazines, skin care professionals, etc. I must say, I am a bit disappointed and will not be purchasing this again.As I am still relatively young, I was looking for something to give me good UV protection to prevent signs of aging. But of course I want to product to make me look good while it's doing that.This lotion feels greasy on my skin when I first apply it and gives my face an oily sheen. I am not sure about breakouts, as I've been having trouble with that anyway, but I think it may not be helping in that regard!Too bad."

231029,2,I purchased this dryer in July of 2005. On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot. I used this once a day almost every day. I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.
222097,2,"Thought this would solve the problem of blow drying the ""bob"". It is too hard to handle simply because the handle is too fat and clumsy. The hair gets tangled in the brushes. Turned into an expensive blow dryer."
140182,0,This worked really well in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn't see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor. Little too pricy for me and not enough results.

But I will still wear it."
125669,2,Can anyone tell me how this is supposed to smell? It's pretty yellow in color and smells a bit rancid.
4820,1,"I have very sensative skin and have tried pretty much every facial wash (drug store, spa, department store brands). My favorite (very expensive) facial wash was discontinued, so I was back on the hunt. I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it. Does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. Cleans, but doesn't strip moisture. Give this one a try!"
198257,0,This straightener is really good except that it pulls my hair more than the cheap one I own... I was pretty dissapointed especially since I have used other chi's and this did not happen.
31718,0,"I thought this was a good mascara, but not for this time of the year. It didn't really hold up during the allergy season. I think that a waterproof version may have suited me better. Another thing that I wished that it would've had besides waterproofing was a curved brush. On the plus side, I liked the color, it didn't clump, and it didn't smell bad. I'd recommend this product to someone who doesn't have allergies but wanted a nice shade of mascara that didn't clump up."
205723,2,"I bought this product at my local grocery store and was super excited about being able to remove the hair on my upper lip at home! I followed the direction to the dot and left the cream on as directed. When I went to wipe it off, I had the most extreme burning pain. The stupid cream ripped off all the skin on my upper lip!!! I went to my doctor who told me it was a severe skin burn and I had to put burn cream on it as well as take antibiotics for a week. I now have a nice scar on my upper lip. NEVER EVER EVER will I use an over the counter product on my lip again! I am back to getting it waxed professionally. STAY AWAY"
157878,0,"I bought this and the smaller size. The small one is great for my purse. I have terrible cuticles. They split and tear easily. I expected too much. You really need to be diligent using it. But if you're diligent enough to massage cream on your cuticles every day, then any cream would probably work."
204054,1,"I first purchased the Aquis lisse crepe hair towel and completely fell in love with it, so I got the waffle ones too. I am so happy with both of them!! As for drying hair, I think they both work equally well. There are some minor differences.Pros for lisse crepe:- thinner than waffle, so when folded, it is more compact- the towel itself dries faster than wafflePros for waffle:- feels better on the skin (if I was to purchase a body towel, I would go for the waffle material)- looks nicerI think you would be happy with either of them! I plan on using the waffle one at home and take crepe one to the gym/yoga studio/travel."
59514,2,"I like the ingredients of this soap and it does get your hands clean but it's a pain to use in a soap dispenser. This stuff shoots out like a firehose in my Williams-Sonoma soap dispenser and then after awhile, it would clog up the dispenser pump. I tried diluting it but this didn't help much. I found it works best by just using it out of the container it comes in but then the lid gets all mucked up with soap residue. My recommendation is to go with Dr. Bronner soap bars instead."

37559,1,"This is actually one of the best smelling and longest lasting men's EDT that I own.In my opinion it's a fresh clean somewhat spicy fragrance that is not at all over bearing, and feels good on the skin as well as lasting all day and into the evening. By the way I do not smell rubber, or anything like a mechanical smell.What I smell in this cologne is fine tobbaco, rain, a little spice and a slight floral scent. Blended perfectly together where no one scent over takes the other.The fact is different colognes do not smell the same on all people, so if you can, find either a vial tester or try to find it in a store before you invest about $70.00 into a bottle."

212171,2,"I wasn't happy with this cologne,it doesn't resemble other Curve products,I would have returned it but when you buy cologne there is no returning.The only positive is when my wife cuddles up even hours later she says ""you smell good"" even though I can't smell it anymore, so I got that going for me."
31586,1,The Clove Mint Zum bar is my favorite of the soaps! The scent is so gorgeous and soothing..and the lather feels like silk ... you come out of the shower so relaxed and moisturized. I love it!
148846,2,"I put this in, expecting it to work since it cost so much. Alas, not only did it hardly dye any of my hair, the portion that it did dye came out a hideous color nothing like it was supposed to. I even took the extra measure of leaving it in twice as long as I needed too, just to make sure the color soaked in, since i always do that when I dye my hair and it works incredibly well. I have dyed my hair various colors at least 10 times, and it has never turned out so badly. Even the time I had to mix 6 different hair dyes and some water together to get enough to cover my whole head turned out better than this. I will never be buying anything from manic panic ever again. They have ruined my Halloween costume with their horrible product. I just hope I can find a way to cover this up before school tomorrow so I don't have to break my arm to get out of going to school."

87719,0,"I love the scent, but....when I put it on to try it, within ten seconds my skin was red and smarting. I don't know what ingredient I am allergic to, but it has to be newish - my grandmother wore this and I tried all her perfumes once. She died quite a while ago, but I still remember that none of her perfumes did this to me back in the early to mid 90s. That's the bad thing - everything now is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, or cheaper, more synthetic crap instead of real oils and extracts. I think Ms. Taylor would be ashamed of what the manufacturers have done to her perfume."
219334,0,The fragrance did not last and I would not purchase it again. The discription on the purchase was &#34;Lait Douceur Sensuel' and previous purchases were &#34;Sunsual Softness Body Milk&#34; and Lait Douceur Sensuel. I suppose the packaging has changed.
32703,0,"L'Oreal definitely provides a unique color with the Light Reddish Blonde/Warmer dye. I haven't seen any boxed hair dye that will attempt to give you a strawberry blonde hue. I've used this dye twice and I do like the results, although the second time it turned out a bit more coppery than I wanted. Just be warned that warm home hair dye can have an orange effect.My only other negative is the smell. STRONG. It's almost worth setting up a mirror outside just for the ventilation."
80759,1,"LipFusion offers the perfect lip gloss for dating. It's such a relief to have found it!Mild grapefruit scent, with a slight tingle and noticeable plumping and color if put on thickly, but otherwise just a moisturizing formula that plumps slightly (no more chapped lips - just smooth, natural-seeming firm lips!).The sheer, shimmery colors are beautiful with my pale skin and barely noticeable on a glass, straw, or date. It is non-sticky and lasts through a drink and you still have a hint of color (and most of its effects) at the end of a meal.I found that there is little difference between the different color shades for people with normal and dark skin tones, but against my very pale skin I saw just enough difference to matter.""Summer"" is the perfect color for me - a strawberry color with a golden shimmer.""Show Off!"" is a raspberry, like the BlingFusion in ""Birthday "" that I got as a gift and loved, but with a more silvery shimmer and a little more berryish."
68187,0,"I would classify this fragrance as an oriental. It is on the heavy side, a warm, spicy, heavy fragrance. It is very similar to Kenneth Cole's Reaction perfume.

237633,1,"I know this product is very pricey, but when you break it down, you are saving by going with a larger container. I mix it about 1/4 product to 3/4 water...and it's still very strong!The peppermint is very refreshing and lathers well!WILL buy again."

102044,2,Please don't waste your money! People who gave good reviews didn't use the clippers long. I would have given a good review at first. After 10 to 15 cuts they gave up completely. It was downhill from about 10. The battery started not lasting through a cut and I don't have much hair. Yesterday they quit cutting at all just pulling and pinching hair. I took the blade apart and cleaned but it didn't help much. Don't Buy!

46068,2,This is old and skunky. I had to throw it away after the first time my husband wore it. Yukk!!!
18844,0,"So, I'm a 24 year old male. I noticed a lot of my male friends secretly wore makeup to cover up blemish-prone skin or just to make their skin look more perfect. So, I decided to try it as well, since I have sort of splotchy colored skin. In some areas, my skin is really light, in others, it has more medium tones, and then others its really red. I don't have any acne, and my t-zones dried up -- I learned how to control that by eating a more plant based diet from scratch and avoiding products with sugar. My large pores also went away after my diet switch. They're now very fine.So, what I needed -- what I wanted, rather -- was a makeup that would even out my tones, give me a photo-finished look, and not look like I was wearing any makeup. So, I bought the kit off ebay (save yourself $10 and do it that way) and tried it.Now, I'll admit that I wasn't entirely sure what to do with the products once I received them. So, I watched the DVD, went online and watched videos and youtube videos on applying makeup. I spent several hours applying, removing, and reapplying the makeup until I figured out what did what and how much to apply before it formed a layer of icing on my face.I figured this was probably as good as it was going to get. After 5-ish months of owning the products, going to the store and exchanging them for different ones and comparing them, trying different techniques/amounts etc. etc. etc. what I noticed was: It didn't do well at covering blemishes, it didn't do well at covering splotchy skin, it collected itself in laugh lines and the wrinkles around the eyes when I smiled, adding at least 5 years onto me, and it looked like I was wearing makeup because it had that cakey look (no matter how I tried).The concealer itself works excellent under the eyes, though it still collects in lines (along with the foundation et. al.), and makes them look worse than they really are. The foundation was never quite a true match and mixing two of them didn't help, either. I had to even the skin tone between my red areas and white areas with the warmth all-over-face-wash powder that was provided, because the coverage didn't provide this. It was difficult getting it just right -- too much and I looked like I'd spent too much time in the sun (or dipped my face in bronzer), too little and I still looked splotchy.I found that going over twice with the foundation was the most I could take without looking too cakey, yet it still didn't provide the coverage I wanted and needed, while still looking natural.I truly do like the products, I just wished they worked well enough for me to like them more. There are 2 products in the kit which I love, however: clear radiance, and the mineral veil. I shave my head, and use this mineral veil all over my scalp, as it picks up any oil and shine throughout the day. The clear radiance gives a beautiful rosy/dewy look for an excellent photo-finished quality.After the last time I became discouraged (I put it on before I went out on a date, saw myself in the mirror, and realized I looked better without it), I went to the Mall of America (since I live right next to it), and checked out the makeup counters at Nordstrom's. I talked to more than half the counters there about my needs, their products, and my dissatisfaction with bare minerals. I had 5 of the different counters there match me up and apply the products all over my face so I could see how they looked.The first was MAC. I had them try on 5 of their different foundations. Some provided more coverage than others, some looked cakey, but all of them looked like I had makeup sitting on my skin. I tried Smashbox (?), Nars (I have a good friend that works at that counter and put the makeup on for me), Clarins, and Dior. All of them looked a little unnatural and as though I had paint sitting on top my skin, except one.Granted, I'm not a professional makeup artist. I know real artists can make almost any makeup look flawless, but I haven't the time nor the creative expertise. Clarins absorbed into the skin, looked natural, and the pigments were obviously high quality. Not only that, but their foundations had a coverage that not only helped conceal skin blemishes, but also evened out my skin tone without hiding the best features (rosy red cheaks ;) The only problem I could see was that their line had a very limited range in color. I don't consider myself ghostly white, or even very pale, but my skin shade fell on their lightest color available, which I found peculiar. In any case, it neither caked, nor collected in lines, it didn't look like anything was sitting on top of the skin on my face, it left my skin feeling silky. Throughout the day, the product didn't look like it needed reapplying -- it's staying power was really quite amazing when I pitted it against bare minerals. And most of all, it looks completely natural.I'd suggest those having the same issues with bare minerals that I had, to try Clarins. It feels like an old woman brand, and I don't care for the scents they add to their products, but the stuff works like magic (if you apply it with a brush instead of your fingers)."
207945,2,MINERAL OIL is the SECOND ingredient on the list. This information is not disclosed in the store front product description before you make the purchase.......Very misleading if you think you're getting All Natural Ingredients. NOT SO! and I'm DISAPPOINTED

208955,1,"While I don't see this lip gloss plumping my lips, it really gives them great shine, makes them tingle, smells delicious and makes my lips feel all minty and fresh. I got the Amber color in a kit and while it isn't the perfect shade for me, I wear it all of the time because it moisturizes my lips with no drying effect afterwards and it smells so delicious (almost like baked cookies)! I will definitely be trying other shades once I run out of the Amber. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it and the tube is pretty big."

219345,0,"I bought this product to help with my splitting/peeling nails.Packaging issue:I bought this product and ended up having trouble using it because the tube is metallic in nature and one push, which I guess was a bit too strong, caused the cream to start flowing through the tip. I tried to cause the flow to stop by manipulating the tube a little, but it seemd to only get worse. In the end it could only be stopped by putting the cap on or keeping my finger over the tip. The moment I would attempt to open it again the cream would again begin flowing out. I finally gave up and drained it into a little plastic container used for samples.Actual cream review:I have been using this cream for a few days and it does feel heavy as mentioned by a previous reviewer. As of yet I do not notice any differences in my nail appearance/feel. I am using this as a nail cream and choose not to push back my cuticles."
166298,1,"I purchased this for a friend last year. A few weeks later he told me a story about a woman standing behind him at the grocery store line making obvious sniffing sounds. He turned around and she asked ""I must know what you are wearing so I can buy it for my husband"" and he told her Insurrection. I don't know why this scent isn't more popular. It has some of the same vanilla base notes of Pi(another one of my favorites on men) and the scent lasts all day. It is also reasonably priced. I do not think you will be dissapointed if you are debating on purchasing this little gem."

Note that even though the dryer converts the voltage, the plug prongs themselves are still made for US outlets - you will need to get a socket adapter.The size and portability of this dryer are great. It's also still quite powerful for how small it is. However, it really needs to come with a diffuser...my hair doesn't come out nearly as smooth as it does with a longer barrel drier + diffuser. But I've learned over the years that the cost of a great international vacation is bad hair...So, long story short, this dryer is great for what it is :)"

156654,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
200447,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."

I however have not used a ""legit"" forever after lotion before, so I can not be certain that this isn't the ""real thing"".

166733,0,"I first experienced Fake Bake at a salon in my area and loved the outcome, but when I look back it was not the original. I purchased this product and began to use it and instantly I knew I was going to love the color, but then the very strong and pontent scent kicked in. I did the self tanner before bed and once I got into bed the smell would not let me go to sleep. To be honest I'm a little worried, the smell actually burned my nose and throat after a little while. I want to use the rest of the fake bake because it does make you look tan, but at the same time I don't want to endanger my health. I have read some beauty products contain chemicals that are carcinogenic, and even though fake bake says they're all natutral I don't understand why I would have such a reation.

50866,0,"First let me say I love the curler set. I have used this system for 15 years and will use nothing else. I have very fine hair but tons of it and it is one of the only things that will curl my hair. It's fast and easy. Takes about 5 minutes to curl my long hair. I leave it in while I finish getting ready. Take them out right before I leave the house and my hair looks great.Here is my complaint. I had my first unit for about 6 or 7 years with no problems. The last 2 years I've gone through 4 of these things. What the heck is up with the quality. One burned out (in about 3 months), the second the prong that holds the curler broke off (after 1 month), the third I plugged in and it popped and then smelled like burning wires (after 2 months). I am on my fourth. If this one breaks down in a month I think I will write the company. It's getting annoying.Get the cheap one, they are all the same. Some charge 8.00 some charge 30.00.

I saw the reviews on this site and bought this soap. I stopped using the proactive & my prescription face cream (which both stain my pjs and bedclothes & can get pricey & time consuming) and started using this soap (in the a.m. & p.m.) and my acne got worse. That was after about 1-2 weeks. Now it's been about 4-5 weeks. My acne is better but it's still slightly there and it doesn't look as good as it was when I used proactive & my prescription. I'm hoping that with time the soap will start working better. I have 7.5 bars left so I might as well use them. Anyway, don't expect this soap to clear up your acne right away. Then again, everybody's skin is different so who knows."
37531,0,"I don't actually own this blow-dryer (I tried to give a neutral rating), but I wanted to make a point about the previous review. California has very strict laws (good for them) about disclosing any possible toxic components in products.That being said, it's hard to have ANY electrical product that may not contain a little soldering lead. The lead is well-protected, not likely to be any harm at all unless you're breaking open the plug and handling the wires. The ""Wash your hands"" line is standard for any product that actually has a potentially toxic component, but doesn't mean you're touching lead whenever you plug it in.I just bought a web camera that had the same tag on the USB cord.Disclosure is good, but people have to know how to put things in context and understand the true risks involved. This dryer, or any other with that tag, is no more dangerous, nor safer, than any other standard dryer sold."

155336,1,"I recommend this book and their radio show to almost everyone I come into contact with, and especially to clients. Millions of us grew up in boundaryless homes...never even heard the word, had zero prior experience with the concept of being able to ""Keep out the bad stuff while letting in the good stuff"" (from others or oneself). I had no point of reference when the concept was first introduced to me and couldn't even understand what the person (my therapist) was talking about. It was Henry and John (the authors) who finally painted the pictures I could understand and embrace. Until then, ""boundaries"" sounded more like ""barriers"" in a negative sense to me. I just didn't get it. In the last 15 years, I've given this book as a gift many times, and felt I gave invaluable perspective for the $20 it cost me. It is my companion text to the Bible itself for understanding the process of being healthy in my relationships and sticking closely to God's blueprint and design for loving and being loved. If you haven't read this book, please be good to yourself and get it."

170516,0,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats.

This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.

Toss the paper eye guard they provide, it doesn't help. Use petroleum jelly and fit a piece of tissue around the area to be treated. That has been found to work better. Be meticulous with the petroleum jelly. The dye runs, so make sure the rest of your skin is protected. Barring all that, I recommend this product as opposed to going to a salon, if you are economically concerned."
37136,1,My hair is naturally curly and I had straighted it and dyed it so much that it felt like straw. I tried Physique deep hydrating and it was miraculous! The beautician couldn't believe the difference - and was shocked that it wasn't a 'salon' product...The only downside is that it's getting harder and harder to find.
182667,2,What a disappointment. The Escada for men is wonderful and I hoped to find the same with the women's. Not the case. This smells like something left out in the sun too long. Wish I had saved my money.
195899,1,"I have colored my medium golden brown hair black-brown(step 2) or dark brown(step 3) for years. I used some sort of color every 6-8 weeks. I applied the product for 30 minutes and 100% of the dark color is gone from the top and 90% from the ends (my hair below shoulder length). I had planned to recolor to a medium golden brown but the results are even enough that recoloring is not necessary. My hair does not feel damaged at all, but I did do a conditioning treatment after."

250276,0,The mirror itself is nice but the quality of the product seems minimal. It is wobbly and doesn't close nicely. I had an older model that gave out that was well made so ordered the same brand but just doesn't seem as well made. Works for what I need it for and the outlet on it is very convenient as well.

I have wavy/curly hair, and was looking for something to keep fly-aways at bay. This was recommended by my hair stylist. I've used it a few times (shower, apply as directed, sleep), and my hair looks great when I wake up. I feel like my hair is greasy by the end of the day however when I use this product. I haven't yet used it for actual ""styling"" yet. Decent product, I'll have to play around with it more."

The gel stung my eye if I was not careful and some got in my eye. I stopped using it at night and just use the avon night cream, without the gel."

I contacted the seller and they said I could return the item for a full refund. The problem is that I paid $5 for this item, $4.99 of which was shipping. It makes no sense for me to return the item to receive a 1 cent refund. I would not order these again."

I have had moderate breakouts for many years and was hoping this would be the solution to the problem (an esthetician recommended them to me). They weren't. Granted, my use of them was not always the twice-a-day regimen I was supposed to do, but even when I was really good at doing the regimen like I was supposed to for weeks at a time, the results were mediocre at best. Not super encouraging. I will say that it feels really refreshing when you spray the toner on, but it's just not worth the cost since there are other (cheaper) products I've found since that are a lot more effective overall."
92139,2,"I bought this product trusting the name of course, I have bought Sally Hansen products before with no issues but this has to be the worst top coat I've ever used. It is tough to apply because of how sticky it is and after it begins to dry there are bubbles forming under the top coat! It's horrible after spending time trying to perfectly do my nails. As well as the bubbles, within 24 hours the coat cracks and causes the nail polish to come off with it. It is definitely not a ""no chip"" top coat. DO NOT waste your money and buy this product or you will have to re-do your nails the next day. I am going with the OPI top coat, much more worth it."

217438,2,"Ok, Glamazons, you know I don't lie when it comes to products and that I do not get paid by any company for reviews good or bad. With that being said, do not spend your money here. One of the first five ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laurel Sulphate. Not only does it act like a harsh detergent, it strips your color. On a good note, this shampoo does contain protein. You do not want to use it long term if you're gonna go ahead and buy it. It will start to do the opposite and your hair will start to break. If you're looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair, try de'Cinque Science. You have to buy it from a professional, but you will get miraculous results. You can also buy Aphogee from Sally's and do it yourself, but, read the directions on the bottle carefully before you do. In all honesty, I used to use this shampoo before I became a professional product ingredient specialist. I didn't understand why it stopped working after about three weeks of using it. It was because I had too much protein built up in my hair. My color was fading fast as well and I was doing my color every 2 weeks. Not kidding. This line is owned by Loreal btw.xoxoxoLicensed Beauty Pro"
38074,0,"The problem with this blackhead extractor is the end-wires; they cut into one's skin when using any type of pressure (which is typically necessary for this 'chore'--blackhead extracting).On areas where 'gunk' is ready to come out of pores, just a slight pressure works fine, even a 'dragging' or 'scooping' motion (as someone describing another of these products descibed it) would work equally well. But on one's delicate facial skin--any type of pressure or exertion with this tool and the wire end pushes in, then 'bites' (i.e., cuts) the skin, frequently leaving bloody trails. :(Not a pretty picture (or pretty skin) afterward, or even the day after sometimes.While the tool IS effective at digging out, it tears up my skin.

I definitely don't recommend this product, spend your money on a different brand."
184272,0,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.

68351,1,"I'm 46 with lots of skin issues. I have always had oily skin with whiteheads and large pores. As I aged I saw the many years of sun worship take it's toll on my face; brown spots, white spots, blotchiness, fine lines, loss of contour. I have tried so many products and spent a fortune, but never been truly satisfied with anything..until AminoGenesis Photolagen AFG. I have only been using it for a month; but I knew the first time I applied it that this was special. It is silky on application, yet not greasy at all. It immediately plumps up my fine lines, and in the morning my skin is noticably more even and radiant. In my opinion, this product, along with ongoing use of my facial stimulation device, has taken years off my face in a very short time. For the first week I really thought the improvement was only obvious to me; but then I began receiving comments from my friends, son, supervisor and even my lawyer. I am now going to try more of the product line. I have never in my life written a review, and trust me when I say I have used the ""best"" skincare products that are out there. I am a life-long beauty product junkie, passionate about skincare and makeup. I am very impressed with AG Photolagen AFG and really encourage anyone wanting to reverse years of skin damage and aging in general to give it a try."

58695,2,"The advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag but somehow I believed this just might work. It doesn't and it angers me to know I fell for the hype. The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product. It isn't. I am Italian and Greek and there isn't anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by. If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep. It they're from allergies, take Claritin but don't throw away $100.00 plus on this tube of nothing. It is not worth the money and can't do what is promised. Please, just judge this product by the advertising picture. It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.The company that markets this useless cream is called ""Basic Research."" Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage. Macy's and Amazon should immediately pull this item. To do less would ruin the credibility of both companies, currently held in high regardUPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy's. This isn't mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn't the first to ask for my money back and I am sure, won't be the last. The fact they took it back locally speaks volumes.Bottom line...save your money and don't fall for this one..it just doesn't work!!"
169374,0,"These replaced the shears that came with a Wahl electric trimmer set that I use to cut my husband's hair. They have a good heft in the hand and and the blades are nice and long, which I prefer. They're sharp, too. But I really can't call them any better than ""meh."" The action -- the actual feel of cutting -- just isn't that smooth. I've owned really high quality barber shears in the past, and this isn't what they feel like. The blades don't meet perfectly enough. They don't make that satisfying whispered metallic ""swish"" sound that perfectly honed blades make when they pass each other precisely. And, while they cut hair okay, they cut it just okay. The hair resists a little, but surrenders.Maybe I'm being too harsh. Browse Amazon or the web, and you'll see that really high quality barber shears go for hundreds of dollars. Pay 16 bucks, and you'll get 16 bucks worth of scissors. Which these are."

Tried to contact the mfg and they never responded, so I took it upon myself to find some automotive stuff that would hold the plates in place under the extreme heat it produces. It worked, and I continued to use it. A few months ago it started going off and on. You have to play with the cord to get it to go back on. Recently, it started doing it more and more, and when I finally saw the blue sparks, I decided it was time to trash it, which I did so today.I have 10 different irons, yes, you read right, 10 - unfortunately, none of them compare to the Chi when it comes to the job it does on my hair. But, I won't buy another Chi at that price. If I find one at a yard sale or a thrift store, fine, but I won't invest in another one at full price if a company won't even respond to it's customers when there's a major problem.It seems I'm not the first person who this has happened to and Farouk, not recognizing this problem should be ashamed of themselves. I met one other person who had the same problem as I had with the plates falling out. If you Google Chi Plates Falling Out you'll see others who've had issues, esp. on [...]Again, if you are one of the lucky ones where you have no problems with the workmanship of the iron - it works great, but be aware, you can easily have trouble with this and be left without any recourse from Farouk."

In addition my skin became extremely red and ugly looking, lost its natural luster and beautiful tone after just a couple of days of use... Does it help clear spots?

202809,0,"Definitely a clarifying shampoo. Does not hydrate. Strips your hair of product to avoid buildup. You need to follow up immediately with a strong conditioning agent if you choose to use this shampoo. I will probably not buy this product again because it is too harsh for my damaged hair. After using it in the shower my hair gets tangled before I put in conditioner. Does not make my hair soft or manageable. The purpose of this shampoo is to strip the hair of products, it's not a great one for washing the scalp either. I don't even know someone I can give it to who would want to use something this harsh. I'll probably try to give it to my hair stylist friend for use on certain customers. She probably wouldn't even use it on herself. Would recommend this product for a salon only, it could damage a person's hair easily, especially if they use it, and then try to run their fingers through the hair. They could rip the strands easily."

Even with the recommended clips you buy separately, I could not keep these rollers in my hair even while standing still - kept slipping, sliding and falling out due to the weight of the rollers and slippery clips. Be aware, what they call jumbo are really the large size velcro and their super jumbo would equate to jumbo size in velcro rollers. So it's back to wearing 5 jumbo velcro rollers overnight on top of my head (it helps to use a roll pillow so rollers are not in contact with pillow or bed). The unit did heat up quickly and didn't seem to burn my hair although rollers were briefly hot to the scalp. Maybe if you had very, very thick fine hair, you could pull this off but even then, I'm not sure."

29883,0,"3 stars is what I consider to be a typical eye cram. I'd give 4 stars to my favorite and 5 stars to anything that had a severe impact on my dark circles. I'm a fairly young guy so I can't speak much towards its effectiveness on wrinkles in any way, I only use it for dark circles.Pros:Very nice texture, I've tried many eye creams and this one is probably best as far as going on easily and without oily residue.No weird odor or inclusion of any visual ""feminine"" detractions. It doesn't have any sparkles, shiny appearance, or something similar.Feels like it does something. Its hard for me to say how well a lot of these creams actually work because while some products like this one appear to have small impacts I've yet to see anything dramatic. This one at least leaves that slight tingling to let you know they put something in the bottle.Cons:No dramatic changes to dark circles.Not the cheapest of eye creams. Certainly not the most expensive either but I'd want significant results to continue using.No coloring in the cream. You could argue this to be a good or a bad thing, but bottom line if its not correcting the dark circles, its not covering them up either.I did use this product for over a month consistently with other products in their face care line."

It looks and feels like you have tacky tar on your fingernails. As for the ""shatter"" it just look like someone painted black gook onto my fingernails and then dragged a toothpick through the substance to give it ""crackles"". It makes my nails look horrible and really cheap and honestly kind of like white trash. It is absolutely nothing like you see on videos. And you have to put a top coat on or it looks chalky and will probably flake off within the first 5 minutes of wearing it. I was so disappointed and honestly I want my money back!"

After, application I can sleep with it on my face. I personally don't find it to be effective unless I apply more than once per week, and longer than 10 minutes.My mom applies it to her face nightly, and cleanses her face in the morning. I saw the difference in her skin in two days. I use much more chemicals on my face than her, so I apply the glycolic 2 - 3 per week, but seldom sleep with it on. (I apply it much or generously than my mom).I think this work best for a mild peel or a maintenance program. I need to remove some deep spots, before I can commence a maintenance program. Hence, I have since ordered MakeUp Artist Choice 70% Glycolic acid for my face, and 21% TCA solution for my elbows with the hope that these items will address my current concerns.I do however recommend that you keep in mind your skin type and sensitivity to citric acid when making your purchase, as well as applying these products to your skin.

My hair does appear thicker after using Mane 'n Tail, but my hair isn't as silky and smooth as it used to be. I noticed that my hair is harder to brush and it gets knotted much faster. However, I think my hair is growing faster than it used to. My hair grows very slowly, and I noticed about a half inch increase in my hair length after using this product.

I am so glad that I invested the money...because of its power, I don't have to have the heat on high to dry my hair quickly. And with a little practice handling it (it's a little heavier than cheaper dryers), I'd say my blow outs are close to salon quality. The only con is that it is on the heavy side but considering its design and the results I get, I don't care about the weight. Is it quiet? I never understood that question in relation to hair dryers. You only get quiet dryers when they have no power. So I'd say no, this one isn't quiet but I don't look for that in a dryer."

109225,2,I bought this specifically because it had he body lotion. I can get the perfume anywhere. The body lotion was like water and a yellow color. It is suppose to be thick and white. This must have been very old.
171744,0,For me it seemed a bit sticky and the smell is almost fruity. Not my favorite hyaluronic acid product.
30402,0,"I havnt been using the product regularly. However I have not seen any difference in the amount of dandruff. The main reason I bought this was to clean and hydrate my scalp. It seems like a good idea, but it did not give me the results i was looking for. I will continue to use it and if there are any changes I will offer an update."
65684,0,The color is a very pretty vibrant red. I had bought it to go with my NARS Red Lizard lipstick. I wasn't too wow by it. My lips looked a bit cracked after I put it on. Maybe some feathering too. I normally don't wear lip liner or red lipstick! so it might just be me not knowing the techniques.
2537,2,"Smells nice, very expensive for what it does. You could find products that do as well or better for a better price."
34884,1,"This stuff is amazing! I was a little worried about some things before I tried it: 1) How much it would lather without what I thought to be ""lathering"" ingredients, 2) Would it really clean my hair and get all the products out of it that I use, 3) How long would it last, 4) Would it dry out my hair and leave it tangled OR would it leave my hair sticky/oily/not clean.Despite all these concerns I still ordered three bars, the Herbal being one (I also ordered Peppermint and Jojoba and Tea Tree and Hemp oil, but so far I've only used the Herbal bar).I am happy to say that none of my concerns so far have been warranted. I've used the Herbal bar for a few weeks now, washing my hair every 2-3 days, and have only just started to make a dent in it (I can probably get use out of it for a couple more months at least). My hair is not short either, it is past my shoulders. The shampoo lathers really nicely and best of all it rinses out very easily, so no standing under the shower head for five minutes trying to rinse out my hair. After rinsing, my hair feels very clean. Almost too clean, to the point that I really was hesitant to not use some conditioner the first time because my hair felt stripped out. But I went without conditioner just to see what would happen. I have used conditioning detangler after this shampoo, and I've also went without using any products to see what would happen, and both times my hair was soft (not dry), manageable, and got less oily over time compared to using regular liquid shampoos and conditioners. Even my occasional dandruff/itchy scalp is not as much of a problem anymore (I'm looking forward to trying the Tea Tree formula to see if it makes even more of a difference there). I use less products in my hair overall because I need less products, my hair looks good without them.So I will continue to be a loyal customer and hope these shampoo bars are available for years to come!"
230826,2,"While it seems like a great idea to combine the shampoo and conditioner, the results were quite disappointing. My hair is dry/normal and I had to use my regular conditioner after shampooing with this product. My husband, who has normal/oily hair, used it and was also displeased with the outcome -- overconditioned. In summary, if one fits EXACTLY into the """"normal"""" range, this might be a great product. This family gives it a """"thumbs down""""."
17260,1,"Not sure how people are saying that this doesn't cover. Maybe they are using a lighter color? I have bright pink and black hair and my stylist mistakenly went over one of my black roots with bleach and made it pink. So i had hot pink roots and the rest was black. I made the color from the directions in the box, applied it to the root and BAM..i have a full chunk of jet black hair now. I didn't have to mess with a HUGE bottle of black dye to do about 2 inches worth of hair."
22397,2,Ordinarily I like L'oreal hair color but the box of hair color sent to me looked like it had been on their storage shelf for many years and was outdated as far as coverage for grey hair. Shirley
190116,0,"When I received the product it had leaked in the carton. The product does not seem ""fresh"". I have bought the product in a deptartment store before and this just does not quite smell the same. I am not very happy with my purchase."
211027,2,"Do not buy this, especially if you have a special occasion coming soon. It's 3 days before Christmas! I never get allergic reactions to anything and this Maybelline Great Lash Mascara Blackest Black made both of my eyes itch and my left eye is so swollen I can barely see out of it!!! I'm embarrased I've had to come to work like this for the last 3 days!!!!~fustrated and disappointed!! that's right girls ""DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!"" Tell your friends and family!"
80414,2,"The batteries provided can barely power the motor. The on/off switch is a 3 cycle mechanism with 2 buttons. On to get low power, off, on again for high power. Already the electronics inside are 'loose' and you need to tap the handle to get the motor to run. I've had the item for about 4 hours."
118618,0,"My wife wore Miss Dior years ago and loved it but for a long time we couldn't seem to find it in the stores, so she started wearing other fragrances. When I found this available on Amazon last Christmas season, I bought her a bottle.Perhaps I remember the scent differently. Perhaps my smeller has changed. Perhaps Dior has altered the scent. Perhaps the bottle was old and that accounts for the strange fragrance (we had that happen with a bottle of cologne for me - we took it back and exchanged it and the new one smelled like the scent I knew rather than the one that I returned). Perhaps I'll never know for sure...Whatever the case, we are unlikely to take a chance on trying Miss Dior again - at least not from Amazon, where you can't sniff it in the store before you buy it. At roughly $100 a bottle, it's a pricey mistake..."
42856,0,"I have been looking for a long time for a natural boar bristle, however, this one is a ""reinforced boar bristle"". There isn't much boar hair in the bristle, but a lot of hard plastic. It is OK, but not what I was hoping for. Otherwise it is well made and looks quite durable."
218089,1,My husband first started using tiger balm as he plays disc golf. Used it for his muscle pains. Then he had me try it. I have arthritus everywhere. I was amazed how it works. My Mom hurt her baby toe and it has been hurting for some time and when she visited us we told her about tiger balm and she decided to try it on her toe. I really didn't think it would help with that but she no longer has pain in her baby toe. This is a great product. i would swear by. Try it you won't regret it.
76474,0,"Its a really pretty color and its creamy so it doesn't dry out the lips, however i settles in lip lines, so I recommend exfoliating lips before you apply. Especially since the color isn't that subtle"
202855,0,"I gave this product 3 stars because it is so grainy. I expected it to be smooth like the other solid perfumes I've gotten, but it isn't. It does smell pretty good, but not as nice to use. I can't really recommend this to other people, because I probably won't re-purchase when I run out, unless the texture is improved."
63656,0,"Love the lavender smell! However, the lotion is way too light for me. Does nothing. Good if you live in a hot and humid climate. I live in a dry place so I need something stronger."
25418,0,"This lip gloss looks nice, but don't expect it to last long. Within an hour I found the lip gloss was done on my lips and an application was necessary. It applies on thick and sort of sticky- like as well. Basically a cheaply made cosmetic. Good for those just starting out with make up but for professionals I definitely wouldn't recommend."
194331,2,"I have extremely oily and acne pron skin and this moisturizer completely broke me out. After one application at night, The next couple of days I had broken out badly and this was the only new product I was using. Was really bummed since it was supposed to be a great organic moisturizer."
240625,1,"Been into giving myself manicures for a long time now, and Seche turned me off because the harmful chemicals! Out the Door takes a tad longer but works just as well in my opinion. 3 free too! And from that horrible smell."
32072,2,"I did a search for ""2012 formula 1 review"", and this turned up. Do the drivers use this product? I'll bet Bernie does."
119711,0,This facial Sauna works fine..the only thing i have noticed is that..you cannot expect the steam to come immediately after it is plugged in(and when the lights stops blinking)..you have to wait for a while..so typically i would leave it on for around 5-8 minutes or so..then put a towel over my head and steam my face.
99632,1,I have thin fine hair that gets very dry and I can use this every day with out drying my scalp from too many washings. It smells wonderful but not overpowering. The shampoo and conditioner together are a great combination for me.
237070,2,I got this for my mom to color her hair. Her head and arms swelled up massively after using just a little of it. I thought this would be gentle natural alternative to ammonia/peroxide based hair color products. Beware taking this!!!
249860,1,"About 8 years ago I first tried the MD Forte line and noticed most that in short order friends and family began asking what I was doing as my skin looked so great. A few years ago I was encouraged to try another line of products and stopped using this one. Slowly over time I realized that my skin was looking older and less clear. Recently I thought I think I'll go back to the Skin Rejuvenation Lotion III and wow! I noticed that my skin started looking better and so did others. My skin alway feels smooth, moist and clean and I have many less fine lines. I encourage anyone who wishes to have a younger fresher look to try this. Be prepared for a stinging sensation at first as it works to remove the dead skin cells that cause a dull dry look. After a short time you will surely be pleased with the results."
208320,0,"Use only on the most oily days and then only sparingly. Will overly dry your skin, your skin will then try to compensate by making more oil."
190550,1,"As a gift I received this perfume from a friend and I was a little skeptical because Jessica McClintock always reminded me of bad prom dresses, but I love it so much I quickly finished the first bottle and I ordered another one. I usually wear more aggressive scents like Evny, Chance or Marc Jacobs and this is so much softer, I call it my ""interview perfume."" It really is a great gift for someone's taste you aren't that familiar with because it is so soft and just makes you smell clean."
66310,2,"I recently purchased this item and when I received it, the coloring was off, the bottle was smaller than 6 FL OZ, there was NO Murad seal of certification, it didn't come in the box and the ingredients were listed in a different order. The label stated 6 FL OZ/ 180 mL, when the ""real"" product is 6 FL OZ/ 150 mL, which makes sense. Beware if you choose to purchase this product, do so from a different seller. This seller is not very helpful when it comes to returns and they provide you with no tracking information when this item is shipped. I spoke with a customer service at Murad and they informed me that the product I purchased, was in fact fake!Aside from the bad review of the seller, I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and have been using this product for years! Its refreshing and never once has it irritated my skin or dried it out like other toners."
48560,1,This is a wonderful product. It is generous in size and compact in shape. The mitts and liners are a plus as they do not come with the other baths. A great buy! Amazon customer service is awesome.
161100,0,"I liked this straightener a lot, but now the coating on the heating plates has worn off and I've only been using it for three months. I just can't recommend it since that happened."
235947,0,"This is ok, comes off when I turn on my pillow. Don't notice ant change under my eyes after 1 week"
204318,2,"My stepdad has been using this for years, and just got a chemical burn from it. His face is weeping and crusty, and the weeping that drips down his chest just spreads the burns further. This is obviously a problem that needs to stop. How many more people need to suffer before the company is shut down?!"
139841,2,"I don't understand all these positive reviews. I have used this product for many months, hoping it might eventually make a difference. I've used it on deep wrinkles, barely-there wrinkles, and everything in between. No effect at all. Nada. Nothing. I'm sorry I wasted my money. No wonder the manufacturer has discontinued this product. :-( Save your money."
78145,0,I paid $62.50 for this product and did not expect to get a tester with a barcode stucked over the tester sign. Testers clearly state that they are not for resale. The spray top is also broken. What a rip-off!
114412,2,This a wonderful Cologne. I just wish it would last more than 1 hour or so. I don't understand this.... Is it an bad imitation? It can't be though because I bought that from several vendors and it had the same weak strength. There is no point to wear a cologne that disappears after an hour.Shame for such a wonderful smell.
199038,0,"It does not work as well as I had expected, especialy for the price you're paying for this product. You could probably find a cheaper one that works better."
18777,0,This is a nice moisturizing lotion but the smell is a little overwhelming. It triggered a migraine for me. I would not suggest this lotion to anyone who is sensitive to strong scents. Other than that I liked the lotion. May even buy again. I have to use it at night when my body will be under the covers to tone down the scent a little.
52675,0,This dryer is adequate at best. The hood is big enough for the largest roller-set but the lid for the face is hard to adjust to a comfortable angle.
52745,0,"The service was terrific; I received my product sooner than expected. However, the lighing on the mirror leaves a lot to be desired. You have to hold the mirror in a certain way around the battery case in order for the light to stay light. Otherwise all is fine."
38613,2,"I understand the need to put an irritant in the scent to make you notice the smell, but this product has gone too far!!If you have any kind of allergies at all, don't get this!! It gave me a stuffed up nose and a sinus headache. My boyfriend, who was sitting across the room from me, instantly got a stuffed up nose an red eyes when I came in to watch TV. If you use this product and your little kids act out-of-sorts a lot, it could very well be a headache from this product!!"
225310,2,"Although my daughter loves this appliance, I had to take it away as she has burned two vanity areas when she didn't turn it off. If it had an automatic turn off and didn't get quite so hot, it would be a different story."
229659,1,this is the best and safest tan you can get. everytime i wear it someone asks where i have been. it's great
197375,2,"I purchased this product in Feb. After using it about 6 times, it no longer works. I cant return it to Amazon - and if I want it fixed, I have to pay more money! This is ridiculous. I wont be buying anything for amazon in a long time. The last item I ordered was a butcher's block that had knives missing. Maybe they should up their customer service!"
149316,1,"We took these towel on an 18 day camping trip down the Grand Canyon. They packed up very small, opened into a good sized, soft, towel that was large enough for my 6'2"" tall husband, dried off very quickly so we could put them back in the pack by morning. Have lasted for several trips and I have both hand washed and machine washed these towels. Very please."
214780,1,My makeup goes on very smooth and it cleans up very well. I don't have to worry about bacteria in the sponge because you clean it with every use.
175894,0,"Even though it was gentle to my sensitve eyes, and did remove eyemake up, it did not do such a good job on the mascara, their own brand. I had to apply it several times and still ended up with racoon eyes."
107546,0,THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK. HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY AND ALL WERE THE SAME. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK ANY MORE SORRY TO LET YOU ALL KNOW BUT THERE CRAP BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!
43369,1,"Jessica McClintock is probably the most wonderful smell, there is.There is not a woman that won't get comments, when wearing Jessica.It is not to heavy, not sick sweet, but is sooooooo smothe....you willlove it and the people you are around will love you."
208084,0,"PRODUCT 3 STARS.This is the first time I tried bath salts. Honestly I am unimpressed. Doesn't feel much different compared to plain warm water. I do feel stickier after the bath though because of the salt. With regard to its analgesia, I think it's all placebo effect.PACKAGING ZERO.Packaging is extremely poor. It was delivered with the bottle completely open, half of the contents spilled, and some leaked through the carton gaps. My concierge was so concerned when it was delivered and called me because ""white powder"" was leaking from the package. To the manufacturer, common sense and simple adhesive tape would solve this packaging issue. The bottle seal under the lid comes off easily and is useless. I am not purchasing this product again for sure."
44717,0,I received this today and spritzed it on but.... it does smell kinda grandma-ish. I can't describe the scent.... I want to like it because I just ordered and received Glow and Live which are great! This is not my kinda scent. I keep smelling my wrist hoping that somehow the scent will change but ugh. SORRY! I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.
205382,2,"Angel body lotion used to be so creamy and dreamy when it was in the squeeze bottle.Years ago, one small dab would leave an enchanting scent that would only go away when washed off.In the pump bottle, it is a watered down, weakened fragrance.And it seems to get worse every time I order.Nothing against the vendor; the shipment arrived super fast and nothing was damaged.But the texture of the Angel lotion is thin and the scent is disappointingly weak -- barely there even if I lather it on.The vendors show the picture of the squeeze bottle, but 4 out my last 5 orders came with the pump bottle instead of the squeeze bottle pictured."
110727,2,"Again, if your skin is too sensitive or you suffer from eczema, like I do on my face, you have to be careful because this product may not work for you. It didn't work for me. My symptoms got worst."
75192,0,Junky product that took up too much space. Dryer was uncomfortable to use and took too long.
61994,1,I've used this product for years in addition to my regular makeup. A safe and easy way to look like you've been in the sun.
44375,0,"This cologne overall has a nice scent to it, a few compliments. My only problem is that it last a couple hours at best."
133118,0,"I LOVE theMurad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream, 3: Hydrate/Protect, 1.7 fl oz (50 ml). I have really dry skin and that product is fantastic, so I had high hopes for this eye cream. It is thick, but not emollient (for me), and I must really need that extra oil because I feel like this just sits on my skin doing nothing. I tried using it on my face, since it isn't working under my eyes, but it does not feel like it soaks in or does anything. Basically, it doesn't feel good - on MY skin. I'm not giving this a low rating, because I realize that what works for one person won't work for another. The skin under my eyes actually hurts if I don't have enough moisture/oil in the product. The only eye cream I have found so far that feels really good and makes my eyes look and feel great all day isSkinceuticals A.g.e. Eye Complex Mature Skin Treatment, 0.5-Ounce. I'm always on the hunt for a lower price replacement, but Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream one is not for me."
150664,1,This tube wringer is the best for extracting ever last bit from any tube that fits its generous size. I love it!
208038,1,"Love this shampoo. I use it to wash my face with as well, it is so gentle. It is perfect for dry, itchy skin. Has kept my facial eczema at bay for 25 years!"
164230,2,"I just received the Helen of Troy Mini 1/2"" brush iron and plugged it in to use it on my hair. It was curing fine then POP!! and sparks! it just blew! This product is junk. Want to know how I can return it."
30035,0,It's a nice shampoo but does not keep my scalp from itching which I thought it was supposed to do.
118727,1,"It smells really good and isn't harsh on my skin. I tried the lemongrass kind because of a few other reviews I read. It surprised me, mostly because lemongrass scented things tend to smell a bit funky to me, but this soap smells really nice."
168608,0,"The scent is a little off, but it's handy to have in my purse and works for occasional needs when I can't get to my nicer perfumes or carry them that easily."
241053,1,"Unlike other reviews that may have involved a seller other than amazon, this Acqua di Gio is unarguably the genuine fragrance, genuine/unopened packaging. I personally recommend the best value 6.7 FL Oz presentation.For people who like the following fragrances, you will not be disappointed in purchasing this one:Cool WaterLiz Claiborne SportD&G; Light BlueThis is a fresh scent, but very masculine at the same time. Girls love this fragrance, you will not go by without a compliment, seriously. This is why you need to get a large bottle of this thing."
250879,1,I pondered over this purchase and glad I decided to buy it. I love it!
91028,2,It smells awful and they won't let me return it. Don't buy this product!!! I am so disappointed. I can't believe this got so many good reviews.
185506,2,"Smooth and don't exfoliate well. I did pick the cheapest gloves on amazon, so I shouldn't be that surprised. But they fell almost silky on my skin."
145695,2,The product I used to use under this name would bring out the curl in my hair and hold it. This is more like a frizz control and weighs doen the curl.
64323,0,"Well I bought this cologne online by accident trying to buy TOMMMY by Tommy Hilfiger from the list of ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon (of which I bought all of them). I did eventually get the real Tommy and can compare them. TOMMY is already a very clean and fresh citrusy scent that does smell really good, and is much brighter than others in my collection already. The TOMMY ""T"" cologne takes that even a step further, and instead of smelling lemony fresh, you smell lime fresh. At first I thought it was a bit too bright (and perhaps it is), but the top edge wears off after 20 minutes or so and the lingering scent grows on you after a while. If picking one, get the real TOMMY (or just get HUGO or CANDIES), but I will get decent use out of this I'm sure."
158193,1,I've been looking all over to replace my old one that stopped working. I like this model so much I bought 2 this time. So glad Amazon had it - I trust them. My order came quickly and at the best price on the web. Thanks!
128127,2,"Had broken piece in box when arrived-could not figure where it was supposed to go so threw whole thing away-no information on how to return so wrote email in ""Contact US""- until today no response. Postage was too much to order another one. Not very happy with product or service for returning-most times I have ordered there has been a return slip in box-none in this one.Also received 2 boxes of Hazelnut creamer when I only ordered one. Why?"
207430,0,"I used this, it's okay. It's a lot better than the cheapo polish removers. But it's not very moisturizing. My nails still had to be lotioned for a few days before I could repaint. I switched to OPI Expert Touch and that's a MUCH better product."
63225,2,"This product did nothing for my ugly dark circles. It didn't sting my eyes though, unlike other products.Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion."
183979,0,"you can't tell from the photo that this is a sparkly color... but i figured i'd keep it for a halloween costume or some crazy night out. the shade of blue is really nice, just wish it was not full of glitter"
187448,0,"Excellent for french manicures. It's Essie brand, which is a good brand. For a minute all I bought was Essie brand."
239653,0,"I love Revlon's lustrous creme line. However, I am olive skinned tone; hence no pink lips. And although I dont have dark lips, this color didn't show well. It's not a bad product, just not the right color for those who're not fair skinned. Doesn't show on medium lips. Same with pearl lustrous pink."
223409,0,I enjoyed the scent but it only last for about 5 min. You have to spray like fifteen times to smell it yourself. I recommend to just use it as an after-bath spritz or something..
117044,0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She had tried Shine and Charms in the previous years. She said it was ""ok"" but her favorite is Incanto Shine."
113496,2,"I have purchased this product many times on Amzon and have been very pleased, but this time I feel like the lotion may have been old, or watered down... Normaly I would get an intence burning feeling after application but not with the bottle I received this time. Hardley any burn and not as dark of a tan."
246589,2,"I have the silver version of this exact blowdryer- i had it for about a year and always used an attachment on the end of it. then all of the sudden the attachment wasn't fitting right and so i used it for about a month without it. I have always noticed how hot the dryer got but didn't think anything of it. I was blowdrying my hair with a round brush and suddenly smelt burning hair. Much to my surprise, it had burnt that chunk of my hair completely off and i now have a patch of very short, miscolored, burnt hair on my head. HORRIBLE product. I looked at the attachment also and the plastic on the inside is completely melted from it getting too hot. No wonder it wasn't fitting anymore."
161747,0,"I am getting the funny smell on ""high"" as others have described. In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch. The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed."
93807,2,"I purchased this for my girlfriend, it was embarrassing when we found out that evaporates in 5 minutes. Not sure if something happen in mail since the pack had signs of leakage. It was absolute waste of money for me."
28156,0,It seems like the parfum wears off on me right of way! i'm disappointed with it. the scent doesn't stay with you that long. i did noticed when i shopped around for it. CHEAP prices AFFORDABLE! for anyone to buy. maybe that's why? it wears off right of way. and i haven't had any complements on it too. :(
176823,0,This would have been perfect if the purple and grey ones bended.. Other than that they worked just fine. For the price I can't really complain and i also don't have long enough hair to use the bigger ones but. I would still recommend this.
6556,1,"Who would've thunk it!!!! This $20 blow dryer is fantastic. Warm setting is actually warm...and stays warm. Can hold barrel with my hands. Diffuser is just the right size. Very high air flow. One review complains it went out after 10 months, who cares it was $20, I spend more than that on lunch most days."
34339,0,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUBBY...I'M SURE ITS JUS AS GREAT AS THE ONE FOR WOMEN
157239,2,"I bought this product because it was described as a ""Moisturizing Cleanser"" which opens pores. This product is simply a mix of mineral oil and Vaseline. The label shows the first two contents as mineral oil and petrolatum. Once you have it on your skin it does not wash off with water. I attempted to wash my hands and the water just beaded up and rolled off the skin. It leaves the skin looking and feeling greasy because it's literally coated with petroleum jelly. Just buy Vaseline at the store and you'll have essentially the same product. Again this is NOT a moisturizer."
126539,1,My nails were splitting down the middle and constantly breaking. A Nail Tech suggested I try this product and I bought some. Within a couple of weeks of using Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II daily and the Nail Tek Cuticle Cream my nails were stronger and had started growing.
251537,0,It is not organic...there is mineral oil which makes my hair sticky and stiff after a couple days use. I have fairly coarse black hair so it is not something I would recommend for daily use...
60577,0,"Hairdryer is heavier than I'm used to. Controls are on handle and in the way. Otherwise, it is just a hairdryer, no better or worse than others. Could've spent less with same results. Was disappointed after reading all the reviews. Will keep it until it stops working."
24944,0,"I like this lip gloss okay, but there are others out there for the same price or less that are better. I don't like the brush and the bottle is very small (smaller than most). I like that it doesn't stick to my teeth, but it is a little too ""sticky"" for my taste. If those things don't bother you, you will probably really like it because a little bit goes a long way and it stays on the lips well."
226371,1,My wife and I love this perfume. She has used it for years and referred many to it who ask her about how good she smells.
145829,2,"This blow dryer looked awesome when I took it out of the box...unfortunately, it went from loud, to louder, to ear-piercing in a matter of minutes and there was also a strange, high-pitched rattling noise...almost like part of the coil was bouncing off the side. In any case it did NOT work out. I'd purchased it for my mother-in-law for Christmas and had to scramble to find another in time when this one turned out to be busted. Disappointing."

When I opened the already once-opened box. The mirror was in pieces. I had to assemble it, but most of the two sided tape (for the back of the mirror) was missing. Also, the mirror was dirty. I had to clean what was supposed to be a brand new mirror. Also, the plastic on the handle was terribly scuffed.In short, the quality control for this mirror is atrocious and/or I got a mirror that somebody else had already returned."
133823,0,"This lotion works fine but isn't a standout product to me. I ordered it because of some recommendations from other people. I used it for a few weeks and wasn't really impressed. It's a fine lotion but I actually prefer Cerave lotion products over this, which are around the same price but more widely available. It's not a terrible product by any means and may be worth giving it a try. I guess I was just expecting a little more."

237094,2,"so I was having serious acne issues and a friend suggested this soap because that's what his mother got him and his brother when they had acne issues. I researched tons of reviews that raved about this product so I bought it. I really wish I didn't waste almost $20 on this useless product. its supposedly ""magic soap"" that can clean anything and is super effective etc etc. what a load of crap. I tried it out for the acne issue - it only made my skin 100000000x worse, I tried it as a kitchen cleaning product because it supposedly can clean grease etc - this soap didn't do much in here either, and then I tried it for various other suggested cleaning. my conclusion? this soap is not magic, it isn't worth it, and doesn't clean any better than the products I originally used. actually it didn't really clean anything other than simple messes that could have easily been cleaned by anything, even a simple wet paper towel. I never write reviews on anything, but I'm taking the time to write this because I honestly wish I never wasted my money on this product, I had such high expectations and it completely failed and was a WASTE"
146335,0,"I am a white female with very coarse, fairly curly hair. My hair stylist told me that in order for my type of hair to be straightened, the iron needed to heat up to at least 400 degrees. With all of the great reviews on this flat iron I thought I'd buy it.I prepared my hair for the best possible outcome by shampooing it with a straightening shampoo and conditioner. I followed that with a straightening product by John Freida, then blew my hair straight using a brush.It took almost 25 minutes to straighten my hair and I had to go over sections of hair more than once to achieve the effect. When all was said and done the iron did a fairly good job but my hair felt like straw. It did not feel soft nor did it look shiny as in some other reviews (and my hair is not damaged - when I dry it curly it is very healthy looking/feeling).So, I give this product 3 stars solely for being able to do the job. However I won't be using this iron very much because of the way it makes my hair feel. For those who have fine to medium hair, this would probably work well for you. If I had to do over again though, I'd do more research and purchase something that was meant more specifically for my hair type."

I may be wrong, but it just wasn't a great buy for me in particular. But like I said, the Nars quality seems good."

86055,0,"My daughter, who is 3, has sucked her two fingers since she was 4 months old. They were ALWAYS in there, especially when she was tired. It never bothered me too much until I signed her up for some classes at our local Y. I saw her holding hands with other kids and then immediately sticking her fingers in her mouth-YUCK. So I was determined to find a way to stop this. My husband purchased THUM from the drug store and she said her fingers tasted good, so I went searching online and found Mavala. I couldn't believe the reviews that said chronic finger suckers stopped in days.....until I tried it. The first day I painted it on my daughter's nails she put them in her mouth and immediately started spitting due to the awful taste. But later that day I'd see her go to start sucking, and think about it and stop. I was completely amazed. After a few weeks of virtually no sucking I thought she was done, but gradually the fingers crept back in. No matter how many times a day I paint her fingers now they are back to being in there all the time. I'm so disappointed, I really thought this stuff worked wonders. I guess my daughter somehow became immune to the taste so I'm off to research more products."
27045,0,"Well, it seemed like a good idea. I'd tried a sugar depiliator, which was useless. My legs and underarms are satisfied with a good razor. But the bikini area needs more care. I'm not keen on strangers waxing my delicate areas, so I thought I'd give this a go.The end result is great, compared to shaving: no stubble! the hair grows back much slower; and the result is beautiful and sexy. But keeping the wax at the optimal temp is too much work without a warmer, and so much hair is left behind that must be cleaned up with tweezers, that I've found a bottle of champagne, a strong light, a good audiobook and a pair of reliable tweezers takes the same amount of time, is less messy, and gives a cleaner result!"

I didn't have an issue like the previous reviewer, just put on my OPI hydrator as a base coat, 2 coats of re-fresh mint, then a coating of Sally Hansen no chip acrylic top coat and my nails were dry within 5 mins and look gorgeous as i check them out a day later :) Couldn't be happier!"

I had read the warning about avoiding the eyes and tried too, but the massager threw the soap too close to the eyes and I learned very quickly the warning is mild compared to the sting and pain the soap causes. I have never had anything burn my eye like this soap. My husband flushed my eye with no less than a gallon of saline water before the sting even began to subside. My suggestion to those who use this item is have a container of saline solution handy, or do what I did: throw it in the trash."

142000,0,"I've been searching for a more affordable brush spot cleaner to break away from using my normal MAC one. As far as cleaning goes, this one works very well. However, the smell is a fairly overwhelming fruity/floral that makes me a bit nauseated after a few minutes of use. It's also on the oily side, which I'm not crazy about. I will definitely finish this bottle up (with windows open) as it does work well for its intended purpose, but most likely I will not be re-purchasing."

7608,0,"I purchased a 3-piece set of Demeter's fragrance which contained, Fresh Ginger, Ginseng Root, and Green Tea. Green Tea was the worst of the 3 scents, because something in it gave me a terrible headache: Trashed it. Ginseng Root has a somewhat musty, incense? smell to it: Not too bad, but I am not sure about this one. Fresh Ginger is the best of the 3 scents. Fresh Ginger has an earthy, woody, and somewhat mysterious note to it and it does NOT give me a headache....in fact, as I write this comment, I sprayed Fresh Ginger on my wrist, and LOVE the scent. It is one of the best fragrances that I have tried; however, I am not sure that it is going to be my signature scent, because whenever I wear it away from home, most people sniff at me, and noone asks me about the fragrance; so, I guess (some?) they don't particularly care for it. I think that I will try Fresh Laundry or Pure Soap next, because many people seem to give very good reviews about these fragrances: particularly Fresh Laundry.I am trying to find THEEE fragrance (or two), but I am somewhat cautious about many fragrances, because they usually give me a headache. Strangely, I thought that musk was the culprit, but I am not certain about this as I have white musk (albeit an old bottle of about 10 years which may have weakened the scent?) by The Body Shop and I tested it by spritzing on my wrist and smelled it multiple times to see what affect (if any) the musk would have towards my sinus area. Well, after a few hours of intermittent wrist-smelling, I finally had a headache. I alternatively, did this without smelling my wrist, and noticed that I had no headache. So, I guess spraying on the wrist, and probably not near the nose (neck, ears, hair) is my best bet, unless it is not just musk which gives me a headache."

118930,1,"I bought the derma Wand considering all the mixed reviews and I have to say.. the texture of my skin has greatly improved. I've been using it for about a month now. I haven't seen much improvement with wrinkles and although I can see a bit of a lift with my eyes, I do not get the dramatic effect the models get on the commercial."
142657,2,"I have been a faithful customer of Amazon for a very long time, but after purchasing bad Argan oil from 2 companies on here, I became aware that they have a serious quality control issue when it comes to natural, decanted products from outside sellers. It has really made me upset seeing that fake products are sold on here and that Amazon doesn't seem to care much about resolving this problem.Okay so on to the product. From my experience purchasing raw organic shea butter, I can say with confidence that what is being sold on here is not real shea butter, but more than likely a similar butter from the African Yellow Butter Tree called ""Kpangnan"". Shea butter is not supposed to be bright yellow (but kpanghnan butter is!), and instead should be a light yellowish grey or beige color instead. Shea butter should feel thick, but smooth, and not gritty at all. If it is pure white, or odorless, it has likely been adultured to be more appealing to the nose, since shea butter doesn't have the most pleasant scent ever. With that being said, shea butter does not smell awful. If you melt it and mix it with your favorite essential oil, the natural, slightly burnt aroma can be easily masked.The product being sold on here is not ""bad"" per se. It does have highly moisturizing properties similar to shea or cocoa butter, but if I want to purchase raw organic shea butter, I want to be sold raw organic shea butter! It's as simple as that. I usually purchase mine on another site for about $16 for 1 pound and that includes shipping. Yes it's more expensive, but it's authentic. And fair trade too! which is really important to me.I sincerely hope Amazon reads these reviews and starts making more efforts at better quality control for these kinds of products. I hate feeling like I'm being duped into buying lesser quality products! Thanks for taking the time to read.Ps. Straight out of the container, shea butter is not very ""spreadable"". I usually just take chunks of it and press it into the palm of my hand to soften it, and recently I learned you can make your own whipped body butter with it simply by mixing it with an electric mixer. Both of these methods work great for making the product easier to apply."
145389,2,"I usually buy the new-packaging product however this item arrived with my last order. Whilst very moisturizing (which I can achieve for a lot less money) the efficacy of this product is greatly diminished from previous purchases. I can only imagine that an additional question needs to be asked when considering ordering this-Is this the original 'brownish' colored cream or the newly 'white' created product. Very disappointed in this product compared to previous purchases, an expensive mistake thrown into the garbage."
127176,1,"I am 28 & have loved this perfume since I first experienced it when I was 13 years old! It lasts a LONG time without needing to reapply & without being overbearing to those around you. It makes me feel pretty when I put it on. I, honestly, don't even like to tell people what it is because I don't want anyone else to wear it! lol but clearly, that's just not possible & it's not going to smell the same on me as it does another person because our body chemistries are different but either way....I like to keep it my little secret! :) But I frequently get told I smell good & it obviously leaves a lasting impression because I have a couple of friends who tell him ""you always smell so good"" every time I hug them. :)"

I read complaints about the placement of the temperature controls...I don't find it a problem in the least, and would ask those people to come up with a better place. It's convenient, and I don't find an issues with hitting it accidentally. I like the type of material that is used on the rod much better than the previous chrome rod that I had (same brand) and happy that they made the change for my hair's sake."
89825,2,"Don't know what is going on with this online Essie lacquer. I purchase Essie all the time; at the salon, and even at my local department store. Never have I seen this product so watered down. I know Essie has a sheers products line; however, not the ones I normally wear. Sugar Daddy is a new Essie color, and I know this is not supposed to be a sheer. But to verify my knowledge, of this product, I went to the department store, and pulled the SUGAR DADDY, and opened it, and it was soft, semi opaque, not sheer. Two or three coats will do the trick. Guess I'll continue to spend more money for OPI, and Essie locally; therefore I'll know what I am getting, before I buy it; and won't have to spend extra money on return shipping, that will not be reimbursed; even though it is a lesser quality product.I think it is in the pricing; if you normally pay 8.00-10.00 for either of the basic lacquers; more than likely this product will be the opaque version.Don't know where they are buying this stuff from? The sellers are great thoughUpdate: seller did refund cost of product, and shipping! Thanks H.O.A"

90711,1,"This is the best product on the market for nail growth/strength. I was introduced to the product approximately 18 years ago by a salon. I was a nail biter for many years, but Develop 10 had my nails looking great within one month. For the past couple years it has been difficult to find in salons or retail stores. My nails started breaking and cracking and I had almost given up and resigned myself to having horrible nails. I finally decided to check the web and lo and behold, I found it. I now have my daughter using the product as well and we both have nice nails once again. Thank you."

But yeooowwww - brush this on your dry skin and your will fully exfoliate your epidermis, scratch your delicate tissue, causing it to bleed, leading to potential infections from the abrasions. This is true no matter how gently you brush with this stiff-bristled tool.Not sure what brush tool others got when they ordered, but unless you have the skin of a rhinoceros,elephant, hippopotamus or other pachyderm, this brush is NOT for dry skin brushing. Plus, the brush comes with a long detachable handle - looks like a wet bath back brush, and in fact, I believe that's what this brush really is.Try the Berben International soft texture jute body brush - it's more expensive, for sure, but you won't require medical intervention to address the rips and tears to delicate skin after dry brushing . . ."

38287,0,"I want to start out by saying that there is nothing wrong with the products. They do what they are supposed to do. However I cannot get over the scent of the lotions. I got the almond milk beeswax hand cream instead of the banana beeswax hand cream: no big deal. I tried the shea butter repair cream one night and then the almond milk hand cream the following night. I could not get over their strong scents. I love the lemon cuticle oil and I've tried it before. I guess I assumed that the other products would have the same light, refreshing smell. Instead, they are quite strong, even after leaving the product on my hands for a while. I should have found a tester for each item before I bought the kit. I'm keeping the lemon cuticle oil but giving the other stuff to my mom. Also, the gloves have a very strong scent right out of the box. Does this scent go away after a few washes?"
177632,1,"This product is great, like most other B&B; products. My one qualm is the smell. It smells very strongly of glue... but can't complain because the smell goes away once it's in your hair.Otherwise, it's awesome! Makes my hair shiny and very soft and it's not sticky at all."
200886,0,"Love this lip stain, it goes on smooth, doesn't feel heavy and comes in great colors but I just have to vent about the packaging. It's sort of a metal feeling tube that scuffs, gets dirty so easily and is impossible to clean off. Even upon taking it out of the box it looked beat to heck, and you can actually see what I'm talking about in the picture here. I had thoughts that maybe it was used it looked so bad. It is just kinda gross when you're putting it on and the tube is all black and beat up like it's been rolling around on the floor when in reality it's been safely in a makeup case and only a week old."
203765,0,"I will update my review after using this a bit more, but after a few tries, i am not convinced that this is going to replace normal shampoo and conditioner for me. i may use this and mix it up every other time or something. I am finding that my hair still feels a bit greasy and dirty after showering and using this product. i have rinsed extra well and not left any in as a leave in and i still feel my hair is a bit dull, heavy and weighed down and not ultra clean. I do understand that this is a lot better for my hair and will help the color last longer, so i am going to continue to try it out. The smell is nice and clean and fresh, i am not getting any tingle from the product as i thought i was going to on my scalp. it feels as if it rinses out well, and i do not have the tangles that i would normally have if i were to skip conditioner after shampooing. I will update in a few weeks when i have used it more."

I know that it's a larger size but I was expecting at least some curl. It's more of a bend, if I can make it do that. It's pretty much stayed in the box since I purchased it last year."
199890,0,"A great product for the price. It has performed above my expectations. It is slightly heavier than what I was accustomed to, but, that really hasn't been troublesome. The control buttons are another item that I had to get used to. Dries hair very quickly."

45122,0,"I bought the RockRidge Adult Eye Patch to ameliorate the effect of double-vision: a temporary situation, I hope. With the bad eye covered, my annoying ""shadow image"" would go away. This was my hope.I wore the adult eye patch for about 2 hours. First, I had to let the adjustable band out some. Then - when it still was obviously too tight and uncomfortable - I let the band out all the way. (I'm a male; I wear a size 7 1/2 hat. This is large, but not unusual for an adult.) This seemed adequate for awhile, but in time the pressure of the band was simply too constricting for comfort.A second, ever more uncomfortable problem for me was the concave patch. I wear eye glasses and the eyeglass lens, the patch underneath, and my eyelid clearly weren't made for made for each other. The eyelid felt as though something were being pressed against it without relief - except by removing the patch.My double-vision is a real problem, and I really had hoped this patch would work out (while suspecting it might not). I think for a different person, especially one without eyeglasses, the patch might be a good solution. An added observation: my wife thought the patch looked sexy. Take note, fellows!"
89371,0,"I like the liner, and it really does stay on all day -- love that! -- but the sharpening issue is a mystery to me too. I've used it only three times now, and already it seems to need some kind of resurfacing/sharpening, but I don't know how to do that. The packaging kind of concealed the fact that this would be a problem, as you don't know an ordinary sharpener won't work until the liner has been unwrapped. I don't want to have to buy a special sharpener I wasn't told about beforehand, either!"
251716,1,"This truly is a dream come true! I've tried many types of makeup through the years, and had given up on using it. It had always looked fake, heavy, and unnatural.

54573,0,"I bought this trying to avoid the &#34;saw&#34; feeling of combs that are molded and don't properly have the injection spots sanded down. This one is better, but I still get the saw feeling every once in a while. It's a good, sturdy comb, but I might spend a little more and get a better quality one."
15140,0,"It seemed to help relieve some of the bumps, but not all of them. I was skeptical about the size, but it lasted a long time, which is a plus. I probably won't buy it again, but overall not a bad product. Might work for others."
250844,0,Well crafted except for one thing I have noticed so far: The caps/nuts on the screws on which the mirror flips/rotates are prone to come undone and fall off. I can scarcely turn from the normal to the magnified side without one or the other of the caps coming loose.
90557,0,"Ok so I read the reviews for this product and thought finally something to help my oily skin and let me say I have very oily skin. I tried it and was not impressed at all, my skin felt very fresh and clean after I washed it and I love the texture of the product but it just didn't help me with my oil problem at all. Skin care products don't work the same for everyone so it is just something you have to try and see if it works. I like Neutrogena a lot and I still think this is worth trying. If you are looking for something I recommend Olay Pore Minimizing facial scrub it is swirled in a little bottle but I found it works great with my skin type."
137189,2,I expected more from this product.I did not find it all that is described.the scent does not remain for very long.
81461,2,"I bought this a while back and didn't like it at all. In fact, I just threw it out. I got no manner of coverage at all, and I wasn't expecting much! J It didn't even out my skintone or make my face look better in the least."
121032,1,"this perfume is amazing, when i wear it people say it smells like anything from warm cotton candy to cookies. it's delicious but not overpoweringly sweet.i just wouldn't buy it from this co, 99 perfume. i ordered it and it took a week after it was supposed to arrive and two emails to customer service for someone to finally respond and let me know it was damaged and sent back and now it's out of stock. how odd! it still says in stock!buyer beware! it may be a good price but deal with a company you know and trust even if you have to pay full price!"
245206,0,"it didnt change the color of my scars, it stimply made them less keloid-like. It basically helps for raised scars, not discoloration scarring."
5455,0,"This seemed like it was working for awhile. No problems the first week. It did end up bleaching my towels and some of my clothes but I think that's because your supposed to let it dry for awhile.At about the second week, I started to get what felt like a rash. I thought it would go away but it ended up being a burn on my my neck. I stopped using the product and after a week the burn mark went away. My acne was pretty bad but I guex not ""severe"" so maybe that's why it ended like that. Either way, I stopped using this product."
181682,0,"I liked this product but not as good as some of the other china glaze ones, it just didn't glide on as well.."
162837,0,"At first the smell is very overpowering - too much and almost artificial. However, after a few hours, it becomes much better."
33738,0,"This is a decent product however after trying at least 3 bottles over a year or so Ive found some don't smell the same as others at all. Must be a shelf life or something ? My real complaint is that the cologne comes out red. Either its red to begin with or the dye on the bottle is tainting it. Its pale red , but red nonetheless.I wish they'd revise that and put a ""best used by"" date or something on it as well."
184260,2,"I can't even describe the consistency of this polish. It's thick and runny at the same time. In some places it goes on too thick and in others you can see through it. It takes FOREVER to dry, even with only one thin coat. I painted my nails several hours before bed and when I woke up there were sheet marks all over and there were dents on every nail. I ended up taking it off because it just felt thick and sticky even 24 hours later. I only even got one coat on! I tried to like it because I love the color, but I hope I can find something similar elsewhere."
148188,1,"This is well worth the $20 cost. It is really easy to use, takes 2 minutes for the entire process and your skin will feel extremely soft and smooth- better than a spa facial. I've used it 3 times so far and there seems to be enough product for at least 3-4 more treatments. I'm not sure why they have included ""peel"" in the name because I haven't experienced any peeling or flaking, however if you do have rough or chapped skin (or it's flaking from using retinol products) this completely removes all the dead skin and makes your face feel great."
164058,2,"Like Cool Water, this is one of those colognes that girls seem to like, but I can never understand why. I was disappointed to find that it smells like every third or fourth guido at a club, while the others are wearing Cool Water, Aqua Di Gio, or Axe. Although I didn't wear it around anybody else, I found the sillage to be strong, offensive, and I couldn't wash it off for the life of me. It also seemed to smell very synthetic, and more like an aquatic than a citrus aromatic. I couldn't detect the citrus, the cinnamon, and in fact, I didn't detect any change through the different notes at all. Perhaps it's just my body chemistry that it doesn't agree with, as I typically wear woody floral musks, or woody spicy colognes like 212 for Men, Burberry Touch, Amouage Reflection Man, or Terre D'Hermes.It has it's audience. I would personally classify this as a cologne for the guy in baggy pants, a track jacket, and a hat turned sideways who drives a supped-up Honda -- and that guy should wear it during the fall or winter. Personally, I plan to return my bottle or use it as a paperweight."
246801,1,This scent has been a favorite for many years. You will certainly receive compliments when wearing Ungaro III.
4168,1,"Couldn't ask for a better weapon to use in battle with my son. As Kyoshi once said, ""Parry is key, but weapon is everything."""
117376,1,This soap is awesome to use if you're recovering from scabies. Really helps to rehydrate your skin. My only complaint is that I used it up so quickly.
171877,2,"Definitely bleaches your hair but didn't get all of the color out. May need a second treatment but I'm not going to try it. Light brown hair here and thought it would be a snap to get the summer blonde look with no problem Even after 90 min my hair came out with big-time reddish tints. Looked terrible. Not freaking out since I'm a guy and I can always cut my hair shorter or wear a ball cap.Ladies, think really long and hard before doing this. Spend the money and get it done right the first time.Happy for anyone who got a good result with this stuff but I'm going to need to dye it back to my natural color or darker to get the yellow/orange out."
26153,1,makes my skin look and feel terrific! wish i could keep it in my daily routine everyday. Price is too high. was glad i could purchase through Amazon!
57047,1,I bought this for my son and he is very pleased with it. better than other body washes he has tried
162719,2,"I had used Matrix Essentials Proforma for several years...it was discontinued...My last can was nearly empty, so I went on line to try and find this product...perhaps someone still had stock on hand. I found several sites that had the new substitute product, called ""Solutions"" with the picture of the Solutions can...I had tried this product when it first came out and I didn't like it. This website had the exact can pictured with the same quantity of contents as my last can, so I ordered 8 cans. I could have purchased the ""Solutions"" for less at other sites, coupled with free shipping for a $75 order, but was more than happy to pay more and pay for shipping to get what I really wanted. When it arrived, it was the Soultions. I notified the supplier of my dissatisfaction and heard nothing back from them...now I see they have changed the picture to what they really have, not what they represented having when I ordered from them. I am very disappointed and feel I was suckered into a bait and switch!"
141285,2,Why did I spend this much on nail clippers? Not any different than the $1 pairs at any drug store!
161416,2,Loved this dryer for the first month. Completly died after one month of light use. Avoid at all cost. Died right after the return period expired.
160465,0,Smallest bottle of cologne I ever bought. Guess I should have paid attention to the ounce size. Not sellers fault.
247788,0,"A normal fragance, but I think for the price, its ok. If you want something better I recommend buying fragrances in the range of 50-100 dollars."
220046,0,"what happened to the old chaps ??? this doesnt small like the chapsi used to buy in the brown bottle !!! this is no where as good as the other chaps cologne !!! BRING BACK THE REAL CHAPS, IT WAS THE BEST COLOGNE EVER !!!"
38981,1,"I bought this soap in Berlin Germany in the 70's, it has a wonderful fragrance, and rinses clean. Leaves skin soft & fragranced!!"
240205,1,"To anyone woman or long-haired man who doesn't own this contraption, they are missing out! I have long curly hair, and Technique makes the best brush products for long/difficult manes. I recently bought this replacement brush, since my old Technique had to be put down... after 6 YEARS! Great product."
225390,0,"I have purchased at least 6 of the Revlon RV440C or equivalent Revlon products over the past 3 years and only one is working now. When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat. Now I need to order another ""spare"" as I never know when it is going to fail. But as you can see, I can't live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier. If only the Revlon company could improve the reliability."
242471,2,The fluid seems not fully active. I have used it three times and the results have not been darking the hair as previos use had darken the hair
165398,0,"This came in 6 1lb pags of parafin beads. Tiny beads. Not the blocks that it looks like. It would have been nice if they were in the block form so that I can use them easier. I use these to clean up my palette and brushes when I am working with encaustics... I don't feel like going through the trouble of returning them, so I will keep it ....... I guess..... and just figure out how to work around the fact that it's not in solid blocks.Some warning would have been nice."
240317,0,"This product is great because you can see if you have missed any areas when applying it and it is a great insect repellent, too. However, it stains everything blue, including your hands and it is very difficult to wash off without a lot of soap. Also based on my personal experience, in the heat the oil separates from the lotion and leaks from the bottle when packed in a suitcase. Solution to this is to wrap it in plastic when packed and you have to shake the bottle well before use. Overall I prefer to use Avon's regular SSS Bug Guard Sunscreen Lotion which works as effectively as this product but without the blue color."
233886,1,"I choose it because it goes with my personality. I could not find it before. It is an excelent perfume, The best one"
243018,0,"This really works about the same as my previous face wash. Before I used Biore both the face scrub and the ice cleanser and with the philosophy everyone said it was an all in one product, a wash, and makeup remover. Ummm. Not much more than what I was using before. So overall it's really not that much better than anythingElse out there that is about 10$ cheaper. Plus it completely strips my face of moisture where I never had the problem before."
1747,1,Shipped on time and the product was exactly what I wanted. I do recommend this cologne and store to anyone for their next purchase.
171183,2,"I have been using this same perfume for about 5 years now. And in that time I've run into a few counterfeit copies. These are really easy to distinguish from the genuine article.1. The fakes have a very dark amber color, as opposed to the genuine copies which have a very light golden amber color.2. The fakes, obviously, smell nothing like the genuine thing. If it smells like alcohol or rancid chemicals.. obviously it's not real.Thankfully Amazon was able to refund me, even through their policy is no returns, and thus no refunds, for flammable goods. They said this was a one time thing, whether you believe them is up to you. But I did get my money back. This might also have something to do with my purchasing history, over my time using Amazon I have spent thousands of dollars without asking for a refund - until now."
79033,0,"One of the 4 bottles had turned bad. It should have been obvious to the packer because it was a cloudy yellow color, unlike the other 3, which were blue.Too much trouble to report and return."
111025,1,"I really like the smell of this deodorant, very fresh and not too heavy.Doesn't leave white marks on cloths of any color.I highly recommend this product.Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden, 1.5 Ounce."
15082,2,I thought since the perfume was from Diane Von Furstenbergy it would be very nice but I was wrong. I read other reviews and thought I would enjoy it. I would have returned it but I apparently you aren't permitted to return perfume because it is flamable. The perfume was too strong and not appealing at all. I ended up bringing into work and set it on a table for someone to take for free. It smelled too bad to give away as a gift.
67499,1,"I enjoyed the relaxing feeling I got when I used the vitabath spa, skin therapy. I would use this product again."
123336,2,"Like many posters before me, this lotion causes my child to break out into a nasty, red, itchy rash where ever it has touched her skin. It promptly has been put in the trash.Please don't subject your child to even a spot check for this reaction. It is not worth it! We were up most of the night with my child. It is heartbreaking to see her in such pain.I had received some of this lotion as a gift and just grabbed it last night. Immediately after applying, she was a giant red rash.Stick with Aquafor, which keeps skin soft and we've never had a reaction to."
50004,2,"I had high hopes for this stuff, but I was allergic. I guess I had no way of knowing until I tried it, I don't have sensitive skin. I had nasty hives and swelling on my face and neck for a full week. More power to everyone else though that says it works for them."
196209,1,Purchased a Chi for my daughter in law for Christmas. In July suddenly it would not heat up. Called Farouk about warranty and got no where. Called Amazon and they sent me a new one. No hassle. Wonderful service!!!
124716,2,I have an old Tekna Micro knife that is no longer available that I have been using to clean under my nails. I thought that something designed specifically for cleaning under nails might do a better job. It doesn't.
92545,0,"The scent was amazing and absolutely as described. The problem is that it doesn't last very long at all. I ended up using an entire bottle in about a week. If the scent lasted, I would give this product a perfect rating."
34585,1,"Perfume samples are ""not for sale"" as marked by legal definition. Note the no-returns policy. And when there is such a policy stated by a seller, they are simply not standing behind what they are selling...perhaps because they aren't authorized to sell it in the first place? A great scent for women. But what part of ""not for sale"" does anyone not understand?"
155811,2,"If your Black american or happen to have the same texture this is only a high price gel, doest the same thing the dollar store gel do...it DOES get hard and it DOES flake....it holds but....for 20 bucks....its not worth it."
37106,0,It heats up really well and it's super easy to use. My onl con is that it doesn't get hot enough but that's my own fault for not picking a hotter product.
243448,1,"The Buf-Puf Facial Sponge, Original Gentle was a bit harsh for my older skin, but my 11-year-old daughter loves it! It does a very good job of gently but thoroughly cleansing her skin without excessive drying or abrasion. I'd recommend this product for any teen or preteen with mild complexion problems."
36357,0,"I wanted a leave in for my daughters so it would be easier to detangle. This product is not what I expected,it still left their hair a bit stiff and hard to detangle. My daughters have thick 3 type hair , but this didnt work and it did not give enough slip. Will not re-purchase. Has a nice scent though"
248991,0,"This is an excellent product, and a head turner as many professionals in my organizations are very complimentary and ask to know the fragrance brand and name which we readily offer."
64106,2,"The Bright Crystal I received was not made by Versace. I am surprised Amazon sold an imitation to me.As soon as I smelled it, I knew this was not an authentic Bright Crystal - it had more of alcohol base note that was repulsive for me.I went to a couple of stores to confirm my suspicion.Compared to the original product, the one I received from Amazon had:Smaller and more spaced-out FONTS;""90ml e"" on the bottom left of the package instead of ""e 90 ml"";Smaller BARCODE;faulty and loosely made VERSACE LOGO (clearly a copyright violation);etc.I will upload comparison pictures once I figure out how to do that.I tried to initiate a return process, but it was not possible because perfumes are flammable liquid.So I contacted Amazon and was promised a full refund.I love Amazon's excellent customer service, but this incident makes me wonder - Are the other products I ordered from Amazon, from diaper and teething toy to guitar accessories, really made by the companies they were supposed to be from?As far as perfumes go, I would rather pay $78 to buy authentic one from malls."
41924,0,"I thought when I purchased this item, it would totally black out the sun. There is still a spot of daylight in the middle."
195032,1,"This product totally pulls the brassiness out of my highlighted hair that tends to go orange after a couple weeks out of the stylist chair. Since using this product, my color has stayed truer longer and saved me money as I do not have to frequent the salon as much to keep my blonde neutral/cool. I highly recommend this if you are running into the same issue. Plus, it smells wonderful and my hair feels great after using it. No complaints."
229387,0,"Love this and the Body Wash. It has the best smell to it. I first purchased this in Ireland and fell in love with it! But, when I received the bottle in the mail, the box was soaked with the Cologne and now anytime it falls over, it leaks...and I have no idea where it leaks from. But, I love in nonetheless!"
66993,0,Does not last as long.. just as everyone has been saying.. But great smell. very close to the 212 . I do a mix of both.
52359,2,yo recibi un correo en donde mi courrier dice que la colonia llego rota y que los contacten para el cambio del producto. Adicionalmente me enviaron un correo desde miami soportando lo que estoy indicando.
203429,0,"I had high hopes for this product, but I stopped using it after about 2 weeks.It worked okay, but I still have many ingrown hairs left. It seems like it is a product I would have to use for the long run, and it's just too expensive for that. I stopped using it because my hands started to peel too much, so I would recommend using gloves every-time you apply the solution."
44629,0,It's not something you could use as the main product to hold your curls (unless you want crispy hair). This is basically just a light (but wet) hairspray. Not for me. I prefer all of the other ISO-Bouncy products I've tried over this one.
153992,2,"Bought this a back up just in case something happened to my good one. It was a waste of money, even on sale. I caught my hair in it numerous times and it just generally doesn't work as well as the pricier ones."
184732,0,"I purchased this to us as a natural way to control fleas on one of my cats, and to ease hot spots on her skin where she had lost some fur. The results is still out, since she did not like the spray bottle I put it in."
180156,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
212775,0,"As I reach the last third of this product in the bottle I have noticed the odor is quite unpleasant and am very hesitant to use it at all. I was not that impressed with this product, anyway. It's strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample. I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products. I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product."
2581,2,Purchased this item and it does not fit on a standard hairdryer. Will be returning it this week.
222322,2,this stuff stinks buy something else a co worker recommended it to me but this is clearly not the right one
92193,0,"I bought this product due to the recommendation of a coworker, who liked the women's version. I can not really smell the product when I put it on; it's very light, but I have received some compliments on it, so I cannot discount it. It gives off a light, woody sent that smells plesant, but not strong. I like it, but it does not last long in my opinion. I think it's good if you want a modest, non-overwhelming smell, but if you desire attention for this scent, it will require a lot more sprays, and there are other scents that are stronger and more bold. Really, I wonder what other people think about this? Well, until later, I hope that all enjoy it."
32908,1,"I saw this product mentioned as the 'Poor Woman's Botox' on the Today show and was so interested. I am a fair skinned 34 yr old with fine/deep lines on my forehead. I am very animated, my lines are definitely from all my expressions.These are like stiff stickers that restrict you from using those muscles that continue to deepen/cause wrinkles. There is no magic ingredient to remove lines. The stickers give your skin a break. It doesn't allow your skin to wrinkle when your face is smashed into your pillow. I also throw one on at home when I find I am grimacing on tough days.Another thing to consider, they are terribly embarrassing! I feel humiliated wearing them in front of hubby. I try to sneak them on and promptly hop in bed before he sees me. The first time he saw me wearing them he cracked up and told me I looked like I belonged on Star Trek. It's worth it ladies!ADVICE! Buy the Rose Water Hydrator with this! It is wonderful stuff that I love! Great skin softener, especially when paired with a high glycerin lotion!Good product if you know what it is and how it works! Even my hubby noticed my lines have lessened."
22403,0,I didnt like the thick way it went on or the way it peeled off The SAME day :( not happy with it
216945,2,"Giorgio Armani 'Acqua Di Gio' Men's 6.7-ounce EDT Spraythe perfume arrived broken, that bad is that I paid $ 94.82 for this perfume, this is a hoax. Do not buy more at Amazon."
173254,0,"I was expecting the gel to be hmm, like a gel, but I realised unlike the gel which came with my electrolysis system this product dries out if the cap is left open and its not of a smooth consistency. It has a bit of crystallization which makes it harder to apply. But once you get it on, its quite effective.Does its job well."
251220,2,"I bought the henna to make temporary tattoos and after hundreds of tests, using pure, mixed with tap water, distilled water, with lemon, oil used to mix the henna powder mixed with indigo, in Finally, I tried in every way possible and definitely not good for anything, is the worst product I purchased at Amazon.com, totally disappointed me and I urge everyone not to lose their money, that the henna is good for nothing, is the worst thing that can exist.

49307,0,"Bought this to help me sleep on our plane ride to Hungary and back. It was ok - it did have a relaxing smell, but other than that, couldn't say that it helped &#34;lull&#34; me to sleep. I will have to give it a try again in another setting other than a plane to see if it works better in other situations."
171609,1,"This is a great color blush for brightening up skin tone, especially in the spring/summer months. I purchased this as a pink-peach alternative to my cooler-pink blush, so depending on the tone I am wearing, I will generally use this with my warmer-colored clothes. Love it!"
68454,0,"More than the wrap, I like what the solution has done for my skin. I've been eating healthy and drinking plenty of water and I'm not sure if the slight results I'm seeing are from this or my diet. But, the cream has improved the texture of my skin - so even if the wrap isn't working, that's a benefit."
142509,1,"Quick ship! It got here 3 days before another item I ordered on here 2 days prior. In comparison to other natural shea butters I've used there is no difference. Has a nutty, waxy scent, and a thick and creamy consistency. Great alone or part of your own concocted shampoos, conditioners, creams, pomade and even bodywash!!"
204753,1,"At first, I was apprehensive about trying out this duo because I have very porcelain skin and thought it might be too dark or clownish looking. I was pleasantly surprised how the color looked so natural on my skin. Laguna is an excellent shade of bronzer and is also great for contouring. Orgasm pairs beautifully with laguna and is probably the best blush I've ever used. It gives a radiant glow and touch of color without being too overdone. This is definetly a must-have product, one that I can't imagine being without now. Well worth the money and love the free shipping!"
75123,2,"too strong cologne. I would not buy again..I wanted something instead of buying deodrant..N ot that I wanted it as a replacement of regular good colognes.I read other positive reviews and thought I cannot go go wrong witha $20 dollar product..I might be better off with a cheap deodrant or a more expensive good cologne like dunhillit is strong to extent of ""stinks"""
249779,0,"Tiny bottle, big fragrance! This particular product doesn't last long on the skin but it was a great way to try this fragrance. A bit expensive for such a small amount."
201828,0,Didnt do a great job of moisturising. Didnt dry or hurt my skin. Pretty mild.
160847,0,"I can't complain how this flat iron performs when it comes to making my hair look shinier and somewhat straight (not pin straight). For the price it's a great deal and I suppose that it works as good as $100+ flat irons if not better. I love how it has multiple heat settings but my favourite feature is the auto shut off. I freaked out when I left my other flat iron plugged in so I vowed to myself to never get one which does not come with auto shut off feature. It heats up rather quickly, love the swivel cord too. Here goes the part that I hate the most and the reason why I only give it 3 stars despite the Pros that I mentioned.... IT PULLS MY HAIR!!!! Arrrgggghhhh! It's so frustrating especially if you are in a hurry. It snags some of my hair and boy I can see the snagged hair on the end plate. If I keep using this flat iron, I swear I'll have split ends! I don't know why the company decided to design this flat iron that way, like there's a tiny space in between the plate and the body/black part (whatever you call it). I would not recommend this flat iron. Maybe if you have the time to straighten your hair carefully for one hour then that will do the trick. Don't let your hair reach that thing at the end or you will see 2 or 3 pieces of snagged hair each time you will straighten a section!"
238362,0,"The machine does what it says it is supposed to do. But know that it is a bit 'flimsy'. I don't expect this machine to last me more than a year -- that's a lot of money for about a year (or maybe two if I 'baby' it.). The light (not the Wood's lamp) doesn't tighten up and I went and bought some teflon washers to help - it does, but the light is still floppy. I do love all the 'accessories' -- brushes and such that it came with. The instruction booklet is written by someone for whom english is a 3rd or 4th language...my favorite quote was ""bald like a monk"" when talking about the metal roller! The instruction book was inadequate for me - I am still a trainee."
240574,2,This is not pink or rose it is bright dark orange as other review states. I can't use this The graphics do not match the actual product either. I think it may be a mismarked batch.
247175,1,"Pros -- you'll probably use less shampoo than if you pour it direct from the bottle into your hand. Usually 3-4 squirts is enough for me (I'm a short haired guy). Also reduces clutter of plastic bottles & soap. Installation was easy, but you have to wait 24 hour for the silicone glue to dry.Cons--are only minor. Once it's up, it's locked into place & difficult to move if you move. The mirror will fog up, but you can apply shaving cream to reduce that. Only narrow neck razors will fit in the holder. The Gillette Fusion will not.I'd recommend this product to everyone. Though, if you have young children, you'd want to position it lower for them to reach. Meaning it won't be in the right position for taller people. I especially like shaving in the shower also."
202055,1,"Somehow no one is making shower caps like this. Why, I don't know.This one has a comfortable covered elastic brim, rather than a scratchy plastic rim sewn to a piece of elastic. My face would be marked for an hour after my shower with the other shower caps.On the other hand are expensive ($40+) and pretty shower caps, but they are not very practical. I don't need silk flowers on my shower cap, I just need to cover my hair those times I don't want to shampoo my hair.Finally, I really like the soft terry cloth lining. An early morning shower with plastic against my hair causes some static electricity and gives me an uncomfortable steamed-bun sensation. This cap stays comfortable and feels like a scarf on my hair, though it does a great job of keeping the shower water off!I bought four shower caps before I found this one. This is a keeper."
87825,0,"It seemed just like a normal conditioner There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it."
52419,0,"Color matches more than the Laura Mercier HydraTint, but does not stick as well when applying."
133487,2,This item did not come in a sealed cellophane box so hard to know what you are getting as the bottles are not sealed.
243229,0,Smell is kind of a bland perfume smell I tried it because it was on clearence lol and i see why it really doesnt smell that good but its not a horrible awful smell either.
208647,0,"It doesn't last. You spray it on and it smells great,10 minutes later,it's as if you never put it on."
66862,1,Cheap as hell.. Go to the store and see how much this is great deal
53007,0,"It did get the lighter color tips and my lower lashes are more noticeable. Kinda messy. The little pads it comes with for under your eyes a cumbersome and hard to get under your lower lashes. If I do it again, I plan to using two pieces of masking tape with their sticky sides together so that one side has a small thin strip of stickiness to it to use. And I will use gloves. It doesn't get ALL OVER your hands but a spot or two is still too much as it doesnt wash off easily like hair dye. The instructions do warn about this. If I had blonde lashes I would love it."
240083,0,"I'm assuming I will like this product, but can't tell you whether I do or not because after almost a month after ordering it, I still have not received it. I believe it is going to be delivered today. I ordered it on October 9th. Today is November 4th and still no hair dryer. It was possible that they were out of stock, but no one ever told me that. There are plenty of other vendors who sell this product. You may want to order it elsewhere."
166269,2,"Last year I bought the Eau de Toilette Rive Gauche and like it a lot! Thus I decided to buy a 2-Piece set of Rive Gauche Eau de Toilette and Vitalazing Body Emulsion through Amazon. What I received does not at all smell like the one I had, and glasses' cover don't look like the real thing. The only reason i din't return it was because I was out of the country when I found out the ""mistake""."

74687,0,"I purchased this lotion because I'm on the never-ending hunt to find a natural lotion that smells like coconuts. I don't understand why this is such a difficult task! I had high hopes that Shikai nailed it, but no. It smells nothing like coconut. Not even a hint of coconut! My daughter said it, ""smelled like flowers."" It's actually more of a powdery-vanilla scent. The lotion is actually really nice - not too light, but not too greasy."
236199,0,"Basenotes have a hint of tobacco, making it somewhat unpleasant for me. I can see it being used by older users, which seems to be more appropriate.For college and under 25 year old users, try something else."
214186,0,"I wish I hadn't paid 10 dollars for this product, but it did arrive safely and quickly to me. I bought it, perhaps naively, thinking it would have a slight scent of almonds. But it doesn't have a scent at all. Otherwise I am happy with my purchase."
98587,0,"This is a great product, I am very pleased with the results. Not disappointed at all, pricey but worth it."
232349,1,"These curlers really do the job and don't take up a lot of space. Ideal for travel or just everyday use. At first I thought the curlers would be too small, but they make my hair smooth, shiny with loose, natural curls. Give these a try - for the price, they can't be beat!"
212941,0,"I ordered this for a massage CEU class, which required Shea Butter for a portion of the class. This is *not* straight Shea and if you need pure Shea, this will not do you a lick of good.So, I decided to try it as a cream for my arms, just to test it out. The Palmer's formulation actually felt like it burned my skin, which can happen when you are too sensitive.After years of testing different brands, I still think that the best sensitive skin lotion I have found is the Curel Ultra Healing Lotion (red banner on front)Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 20 Ounce. Just note that it is not a Shea product.If you need to purchase a straight Shea Butter, I can suggest the ""NOW"" brandNOW Foods Shea Butter, 7-Ounceor something which is pure. I ended up picking up the NOW brand at my local Whole Foods. It comes in a small open mouth tub and worked wonderfully."
19797,2,This is a watered down fake bottle of Biosilk. The real one is thicker and smells a lot better than this one.
171927,2,"Waste of money, will not buy again. Not enough &#34;scrub&#34;, and its supposed to be odorless but has an odd lingering smell."
103502,1,I am allergic to alot of soaps & perfumes - this is the best soap out there for anyone with allergies or whose skin dries out easily.
167126,0,"I found this little guy at Walgreens, where he was a whopping $15. I have a few other Eucerin products and know they are pricey, but worth the money, so I took my chance on it.I don't have rosacea, but my skin was really red from staying out in the sun for too long. I used this product in the morning, as instructed. Later on during the day, a friend said to me, ""You look pale!"" (versus me looking 'red'). You can take that as a compliment or not, but that indicated to me that the product at least worked. However, I will definitely use sparingly next time. I agree with other reviewers; this stuff can leave a residue on your face, making you look more odd than you would with red skin. Again, USE SPARINGLY. People with tan skin, be careful! I don't wear make-up, so if you do, you may not experience this 'problem' (foundation, concealer, etc).Avoid getting it in your eyebrows, some green residue will be left behind. If you have super dry skin, moisturize before using. The product can create a splotchy effect if you don't moisturize prior.Overall, does it's advertised to do. SPF is a plus!"
204827,0,"I'll say that the product does what it advertises: it moisturizes the delicate eye area.Mine doesn't have any noxious odor - and I'm usually VERY sensitive to odor. I have very dry under-eye-skin (I can use vaseline in a pinch), so my skin absorbs this like there is no tomorrow. However, it is a yellow-orange color, and as I have very fair skin I can only use this at night unless I want to look like I lost a battle with a carrot.Further, I can't use this product in the Summer as my house is not air conditioned. As soon as the temp goes above 70 degrees, the product seperates, and there is a an oily film (later an oily sauce) on the top of the balm, and what looks like buttered corn meal underneath. Not terribly appetizing. I suppose I could get a small fridge for the bathroom, but just don't have the time. I complained to Suki about this last year; and didn't receive a response. Was disappointed about that too. If my very sensitive skin didn't prefer their other products so much, I'd find another brand! At least I've found a replacement for this product!"
168308,0,"In my opinion, as others reviews, it didn't look like an actual mint color (not as pictured). It was more white/chalk color, and I didn't like it... because it wasn't what I expected at all."
77349,0,"Ok, I have tried a lot of stuff to stop the mass exodus of my head fur...and some things have worked better than others. This product I am giving a mixed review. First, the good: The pills did stop the exodus of my remaining hair when taken regularly.Now for the bad: I did not notice any real regrowth and, like others have said, the pills can really dry you out. When I lived in Denver, I could hardly open my mouth in the morning without tearing something open. The pee color change did not bother me, though. As for the liquid...it was a waste of money. It was gooey and smelled odd, made my thin hair look even thinner by plastering it all to my head or sticking all the hair together, messed up my pillows...ick.So...my verdict...I am going to try something else...but keep the pills as a backup. At least they kept me from losing more hair."
40578,0,"I have tried lots of concealers, and I am still on the lookout for the perfect one. This one, however, is better than most I have tried. A little goes a long way, and it's easy to use too much. It does work wonders if you have a little imperfection, all it takes is a little dab and it covers it well. It lasts a very long time, I have had my tube for quite a while."
80949,2,"Okay product. Not worth the $9 shipping and handling judging by the material of the item and packaging."""
102102,0,I bought and brought it to Iraq with me. I used is for about 8 mouths before it burnt up. The only down fall i have with it was the cheap guards that always popped off.
37975,2,i purchased this product thinking it was the same as the one i was almost running out of. i already had a 3.3 onz bottle wich was purchased many years ago. i just used this yesterday and i found that this is a verry watered down version of my original product. this is not the same i paid 66 bucs for alchohol this sucks. and i thruw the box away so i cant return this. whats wores is i rely love this colone and dont even know if they still make the original. i even gone as far as putting on a lot to see if maybe i will smell the same but it dosent. with the original a small cople of sprays would last all day. i not shure if the seller bears any fault in this or if its just the makers falt but i feel misled
15998,0,"This cologne is... okay at best. The cologne received raving reviews, but in my opinion the cologne has too much juniper base smell (reminding me of Gin), and has a more feminine scent. The cologne does last a long time (approximately 8 hours when applied to skin, not clothes).If i had smelled this in a department store before purchase i would not have purchased this on amazon.Other colognes i'm using:-gucci guilty (highly recommend)-Polo blue (highly recommend)-kenneth cole black (recommend)-armani aqua di gio (recommend, but everyone has it)-CK in2u (summer scent)-polo romance (love the smell when it's settled, would recommend)-bvlgari extreme (eh, so-so.)"
218263,2,"I bought this perfume as a gift for someone in their late forties, and it smelled terrible to them and myself. I thought this perfume would be really good for a mature gift for a woman, but I had no idea it should have been for an older woman in her sixties. I saw all of the good feedback, but in the end it was a major disappointment for a Christmas gift."
19372,0,"I originally bought the lightest shade they had (Fair) and that was too dark, and I'm not even the palest person I know. If you have porcelain skin or are on the pale side, this makeup will be too dark on you!! Since I first bought Fair I've darkened a bit and now Fairly Light looks good on me. It seems though there is no in between. If you're not within a shade of any of these colors, the color will be too dark or too light. Now that I've found a color that matches my skin as best as it can, I do like wearing this product. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing a lot of makeup and doesn't cause my skin to breakout. I just bought my second jar and I can't wait to get it in!"
115966,0,I love Burt's Bees products. I was using this as a daytime moisturizer which it most definitely is NOT. It is very dense and best suited to use at night. Even if your skin is very dry it is too greasy to use for the daytime.
173872,0,"I bought these for a goth fairy costume for Renaissance Fairs. The wings are large and beautiful. The straps are wrapped so they don't start rubbing or hurting over time (was able to wear all day without any problems). The only downfall is obviously they are sold everywhere, so if you are looking for something unique, these are not for you. If you're looking for affordable wings for a costume and don't care if you match other people...look no further!"
212944,2,This product is a little too greasy and takes a long time to rub in. Did not notice any significant difference in my skin after using up the entire bottle. Not recommended.
230404,0,"I don't know if a week is long enough to review this product especially since it can be used only every other day, but here goes. Every winter my scalp gets extremely dry so I wanted to give the Neutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength Shampoo a try. It did seem to help reduce flakiness somewhat on the days I used it. It really does smell awful though, and the smell lingers. It's so strong that it almost seems to last through the next shampooing with my regular shampoo. Another thing was that all the warnings on the bottle concerned me. I don't know if I would recommend this product to others just yet. I might use it for another week or so and then make my final judgement."
97814,0,"The main ingredient is the one that's recommended for use after laser treatments (hydroquinone) to prevent the reoccurrence of brown spots, to slow pigmentation. But the one at the laser center was 7x the amount.I bought this on the recommendation of an online store that recommended this for the most nether regions (*). I have noticed a big difference under my arms and a mild change on my elbows, but havent been diligent enough to see major results elsewhere.This product has a very faint smell of nair which dries to the smell of tissue paper. While not repulsive, it was definitely not the flowery, milky white smell I was hoping for. It also has a bit of an oily/waxy feel, that makes you cling to your clothes for a bit.But I have no major complaints and will start to use this product again, this time more diligently!! (Recommended 2x a day, per the product directions.)"
131979,0,"I have very thick and VERY curly hair. I was hoping to feel more of a difference when I used it for the first time. My hair does feel softer, but not work the 20 bucks."
231557,0,"Essie has some very beautiful colors, but all the nailpolishes have formaldehyde. There are other brands that also have pretty colors and are Big 3 free. Would not recommend this product. 3 stars for the color selection."
235166,0,"This powder/foundation is the best color match I have ever found, plus it has great coverage without being too matte/heavy, when applied with a good-quality, natural hair powder brush.I love MAC products, usually, just not this one.I think it contains mineral oil, probably in very high concentration. Every time I use it near my chin and nose, I break out, badly. The rest of my face gets red and itchy, too. I'm apparently allergic to mineral oil, and when I stopped using this makeup, the breakouts stopped, too.I switched to a synthetic brush at first, thinking that the natural animal hair was the problem, but it didn't help. I switched to Bare Minerals, trying to get a more natural product with the same coverage as this makeup offered, but that didn't work, either--that brand is too sheer and the color match just wasn't as good as MAC. Bare Minerals did feel light-weight on my face and was nice for summer, though.I don't like liquid foundations, or I'd try MAC's Studio Fix Liquid version, which I hear is 100% mineral-oil free. the reason I don't like liquid foundations or concealers, is because they're harder to take with you and apply when you're on the go, or can't get in front of a mirror somewhere to see what you're doing. I'm on the run and also travel a lot, and I wanted one thing that was easy to pack, that I can carry with me in a coat pocket or very small purse, that works well, and isn't outrageously expensive.Any suggestions/good alternatives to this one, ladies?"
208008,1,I received a sample from my sister and both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. This is a wonderful soft fragrance that lasts the majority of the day! I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband and he loved it!
106786,0,"This is a fresh, clean fragrance. It's pretty intense, so one small spray is all you need. The staying power isn't half bad, either. For me, though, the woodsy notes are a bit overpowering, which is a bit of a turnoff. I will not purchase a full-size version for that reason."
154347,2,Leaves oily residue. A lot of it. Needs more than just one swipe to take off all of your makeup. Goes easily on your skin.
215202,0,I was looking for a shampoo that would give volume to my hair. This product was disappointing. It's not any better that the shampoo I'm already using for half the price.
8713,1,"I had to try after seeing the video. My first morning styling my hair I tries it and I had to giggle. It truly covers up my scalp making my hair ""NOT"" look so thin.I have had so many morning's where I would just want to cry. I can't stand seeing my complete scalp right in front of my head. I truly do not have enough hair anymore to cover it up and was soooooo self-conscious of it on a daily basis.Now I blow dry my hair than sprinkle some of Topick right in the center of my head and style, spray, and I'm off to work.I have had it only two weeks and I'm ordering some more. I don't want to run out. It is my new best friend.Sincerly,A woman at the age of 49 feels much more secure because of this product."
153378,1,"All of the Dr. Bronner soaps are fantastic. They are certified organic and have not been tested on animals. I usually buy the liquid as it seems more economical and a tiny squirt is all you need, especially if you use one of those net shower sponges, I use it everyday and a gallon lasts me over a year. If you buy one of the smaller ""shower friendly"" sizes, save the bottle and get the gallon size for refills. I love the Tea Tree and the Peppermint is very refreshing especially on a hot day. I bought the bars for a friend because he thinks that men don't use liquid soap, I don't agree and think that whatever you like is good regardless of your sex, so guys don't be afraid of liquid soap being too girly. If you do go for the bar soap, try to keep it somewhere that doesn't get hit with the shower stream or your bar won't last very long. An added bonus with the liquid is you will be in and out of the shower a lot faster which means using less water (and a few extra minutes of sleep for me)."
121897,2,"When I bought the straightener I was instantly unsatisfied with the lack of heat it produced. It took many different tries to get 1 inch sections of my hair straight. After just 1 month from the purchase date, only one side of the iron worked. Unfortunately I couldn't find my receipt and was stuck with half a straightener."
50677,0,"I bought this based on positive reviews and personally find it ""ok."" I can not believe that other ppl claim the curls last for a couple days! unimaginable! I will say if you leave it in for any more than 15 minutes, you will come out with a head ball of curls (and not very stylish!). No worries, as the curls die out in a couple hours and relaxes to a very soft wave. I like this alternative to heated rollers bc it seems less damaging to your hair and at least for me, the results are basically the same (curls only hold for 3-4 hrs), so I chose to keep this set over traditional heated rollers."
204080,0,"I was looking for a replacement for my thin ""hair towels"" which are now ragged with age. This works well -- thin and absorbent. As pointed out in the other reviews it's about the size of a larger hand towel, which is fine for me.However, based on the descriptions and the price, I'd hoped to have something super and amazing that would render my hair dryer all but obsolete. If you don't care what you spend, buy this towel -- but otherwise I wish I'd bought something cheaper. (I wanted to give 3.5 stars.)--I noticed just now that today's price is much lower than the over twenty dollars I paid. It won't let me change the stars, but I'd've rated it higher. Watch for sales!"
250205,0,"This mirror is very similar to the Windmere unit that I had for about 10 years and loved until it wouldn't turn on any more. The lighting on the Jerdon is clean and bright and the overall design is good. However, the quality of the mirrors is such that the reflection is distorted, especially on the magnified side. I'm not talking about the distortion that the magnification naturally creates. Unlike the magnification distortion, my eyes take a few moments to adjust to this distortion (sort of like putting on someone else's prescription eyeglasses). This is likely due to the reflective surface being of a lesser optical quality. So far it's the the best I've found without spending big bucks, but perhaps that's why some other mirrors are more expensive.7/3/10 UPDATE. I have found the distortion the mirror causes to be too irritating. Also, the lights are taking longer and longer to turn on. I will be looking for a different mirror soon."
142406,0,"This mirror is great at not fogging up, but it won't stick to my shower wall. It falls down after 5 seconds. Luckily, the mirror seems pretty sturdy. It didn't break all those times I tried to stick it to the wall and failed. I have a shower caddy hanging from the shower head that I put the mirror in and it's the perfect height, so it works for me."
213073,0,This brush is a bit stiffer than I had expected. Also the handle does not stay on very well. It does the job pretty well - I just have to use very light pressure so I don't scratch or irritate my skin.
186707,0,Wasn't any different than Head and Shoulders 2-in-1. A little more watery perhaps. Not like it left me in awe... functional.

99057,0,I suffer from a very extreme case of eczema on my hands and I decided to try this 'fragrance free' lotion. It has a very unpleasant smell to it. It kind of smells like play dough. It also leaves a slick greasy residue after about 30 minutes of application. I have since switched to the Aveeno - Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion with Lavender and Chamomile (purple label). It is lightly frangranced and is a much better product in my opinion.
222553,2,"I bought this thinking is was the trademarked Tiffany Perfume but it's actually Tiffany by ""Tiffany for Women"" (whoever that is). The perfume that arrived was not the perfume that was pictured. I returned the perfume per the seller's instructions and I'm awaiting a credit. I think you should show a picture of the product you're selling not the product you're emulating."
10161,1,i expected green and got pink but it all works just the same. its a little bit intense of a pink but totally effective and cute if use sparingly. The black is so cool when it turns!
111705,0,"I've always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn't want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.I went through all kinds of styling tools fromRevlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional HairsettertoConair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron, and then some...even hair products like Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz..I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn't fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I've had my waves last overnight.I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don't have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous."
65849,1,"My sister originally purchased this for me last year. It's a light, fresh, alluring scent that can be worn for all occasions. She uses it too and I just bought her a bottle for her Christmas present. Yes, it also is the original product. Neither of us had a problem with the perfume as it's the real deal. Happy Shopping!"
164836,2,"I read all the reviews on Amazon for this curling iron and was so excited to receive it. However, as soon as I plugged it in I could tell something was off. I couldn't tell if it was heated up all the way because it still felt warm... so I waited 5 more minutes and no change... in a lot of the reviews people said it only took 30 seconds to heat up! Not mine... after 15 minutes on the highest heat setting, I could still touch the barrell. So upset! I got this curling iron to replace a bad quality Revlon brand one from the drugstore that barely curled my hair. But with this iron, I don't see any difference.I am positive that Hot Tools is a great brand, but I'm also convinced I got a knock-off. I ordered from the lowest-priced seller, which happened to be ""Amazon.com."" If I were to do it over again, I would ORDER FROM A SMALLER SELLER. I was enticed by the free shipping, but I would pay shipping all over again just to get the real thing from a more legit seller. Be careful who you buy this iron from, you could get a knock-off!!!!"
131604,0,"These little guys are great while they work, but beware - they typically break their seals/gaskets before 6 months time, rendering them useless and drippy. I bought two last time I purchased them, and I have already gone through both of them. And I did make it a point to not pressurize them too much when I used them. Nice fine mist though. I think I'm going to try the MistyMate Misty 8oz. next, as it looks like it is built a little more heartily."

237311,1,Soap works well on most all common hand cleaning needs around our farm. But residual smell is not the most pleasing and could be better.
61767,1,I ordered Opium Colonge spray from Amazon and saved $20.00 on this purchase. It was not a knock off. Extremely pleased.
6398,2,"My CHI hairdryer bit the dust after 7 years, so I bought this because it had great reviews and was cheaper. This hair dryer is not good on my hair, I'm going to put it in my garage sale. My hair feels very dry and looks frizzy after using this dryer and I never had that problem with the CHI. Sorry, but I'll spend the money now and get a good hair dryer."
116095,2,"This is my first review after using Amazon for many years. I have been using the Cotton Candy spray since 2007. When I saw the moisturizer, I was so excited. It smells awful! I slathered it all up and down my arms and couldn't stand myself and ended up in the shower. I don't understand, since I also ordered the spray and it is wonderful. I don't know if it has been sitting on a shelf too long or what, but it is going back."
197325,0,"Well ive always used a Revlon non ceramic one. it has lasted forever, and staightened my hair pretty quick. My only complain was it was curly by the next morning, with any humididy and anytime i sweat even a little bit. The Chi definetly last a lot longer and gets hot realy quick. But it doesnt take any less time to straighten and doesnt get any straighter. I expected a miricle i guess."
230904,2,"This did absolute nothing for me. It did not reduce my stretch marks at all. Didn't make them worse either! But I would not recommend it as I think it's a waste of money, unfortunately.."
191239,0,"Not so sure it's better than my old out-dated hair dryer in terms of drying ability. The ionic shine feature doesn't really do much, either. At least I don't notice a difference. The cool blast? It's slow in coming.Where this product shines is the cord keeper. I think the cord could be a little longer, but for the convenience of quick rewind, I'll take it."
4275,0,"This spray had a mild scent, but unfortunately I didn't like the scent at all. I usually like lavender, but I didn't care for this one, so I probably wouldn't buy it again. I might, however, buy it in another scent. The bottle was very attractive."
215581,0,This cream is good. It does not remove wrinkles or even diminish signs of aging but I like it. It's not too oily or drying. I wear it morning and evening.
164700,2,"I tried this since I was looking for something to smooth my skin (ie the name of the product)..... it shot, and missed.....I moisturized fairly ok..... but it left my skin tacky tacky tacky....plus the little beads in the lotion were unnerving. If I want something to TRULY exfoliate, I want it in my body wash.... not my lotion.The smell was horrid. I couldn't stand it, and it radiates off of you LONG after you slather this on. I ended up throwing out my whole bottle after only using it twice I think. I'll stick with Vaseline."
33372,2,"I should have fondled it at the store before I ordered it on-line. My biggest complaint about this product is how the clipper is attached by plastic. It looks like over time it may break. Also the knob you press/pull to extract the clipper is also the key chain ring.(so I can see clipper accidently being pulled out when there is tention on the keychain ring. I think it's a bit big to attach to your keys. 2.5 inches long and 3/4 inches width. also the twizer and toothpick is facing down when attached to key ring so I wonder if I will end up loosing it. Time will tell. Good points are, it is very light weight, coming it at 1.4 oz. Clippers it self seems to function very well. I had no problem clipping my nails with it. this product is just okay. I'll keep it but I wouldn't recommend this product."
195893,0,"I gave this product 3 stars for the following reasons:1. This product does exactly what it says it does. Removes the dye from your hair.2. It does NOT restore your hair to its original color. I read ALL the reviews and watched MANY YouTube videos before I purchased and used this stuff.3. My hair turned orange.You can read about my adventure in more detail here: &lt;...>I did not use the developer, because I did not want to start over from scratch with hair that is too dark. (I did give it some serious thought, though.) I decided to try to live with the color. In the 5 days since I did this to my hair, it has darkened up on its own. My hair color is now a color I can live with, even though it is not a color I like. If it keeps getting darker, I will use the rest of the product in the bottles and then re-color it with a light brown.My thoughts on the smell: it's not too bad. When I get in the shower and wet it, there is a very faint odor.Condition of my hair afterwards: It is in the same condition as before I removed the dye. (not dry or burnt - even though that's how it looks)"
41791,1,"I really love Pure Poison perfume. I am very picky about my perfumes, and over the years have hunted for one that suited my tastes, style, preference, and this won me over completely. To me, it is a seductive, sexy scent, but not too overpowering, and makes me feel youthful and sexy, though I am only in my mid 30s. I always receive compliments on it, from my dental hygenist, to my coworkers, and of course, my husband! If you are after a modern, sexy scent, that is also fresh and flowery, then this is a good perfume. I have found my signature perfume, and of course, Christain Dior has such a great reputation, from fashion to style and image, and definitely perfumes. Wonderful perfume!"
10983,0,"I love the smell of tomato leaves, and I was hoping that this perfume would smell just like them. Answer-- not really. There's a little bit of an herbaceous, leafy sort of smell, but it's combined with kind of a generic floral scent. The smell is okay, I'm just disappointed that it's not what I was expecting."
76762,2,"Beware of ordering fragrances from Amazon. I love Obsession and have worn it for years. This bottle smells like it is old...it has an alchohol-like distorted scent...not like the Osbession I am accustomed to. I cannot return it to Amazon because of federal regulations which prohibit regular citizens from packing and shipping fammable liquids. So I am basically out $35.00. From now on, I will buy all fragrances in store."
39511,2,"I used this stuff years ago - and still works well, but the smell. Smelled like something rotting! Do NOT recommend."
129223,2,Do not like the coverage and or the smoothness of the product. I have heard some positive things about this product for quite some time and felt I should try it. I am very dissappointed.
187343,1,very strong cream but it really works. please be aware that the sun can irritate the skin causing it to get dark so use sunscreen
238206,0,"Everything works as advertised, however, it did not meet my expectations. I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz. However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time. Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair. Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway. The heat is not controlable, except for the ""COLD"" button you have to hold down to get just air. As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible. I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off. Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair."
245347,2,"I tried this product out for a couple months and my conclusion is: 2/5. My skin is pretty fair and is pretty sensitive to any harsh chemicals or exposures. This only left my skin drier after putting it on. I would try to layer on more but was still left with dry skin. :( I'm not saying that this product won't work for anyone, but for me personally it did nothing. Just my two cents."
241376,1,"This product is terrific. whenever my skin may act up, i just use a little of this and gets me right where i need to be"
114300,0,"have tried a number of eye cremes/lotions/potions and this is one of the only organic ones available that has been worth trying. I do think that it is moisturizing, but have not seen any change in the texture of my skin.I have light undereye wrinkling that it did not alter, though the area was soft and never irritated. It has a fairly thin consistency and you have to be sure to shake well before using to avoid a watery mess.I used approximately half the bottle before giving up on it. That did last quite some time (about 2 months),so it is long-lasting. It just did not do anything other than soften and hydrate.If you are looking for a great, organic moisturizer you will probably love it, but if you are expecting ""rejuvination"" in the appearance of wrinkles or undereye darkness, keep looking and best of luck!"
122625,1,"OPI has developed this product to strengthen and help cure split nails. Well, it really works! The matte version is especially suited for men because it does not have a glossy finish. It dries looking like a fresh manicure. I advise following the directions since it does require a little more time to dry hard than regular nail polish.The matte version is sometimes packaged with the gloss as a ""his 'n hers"" duo.It also works great on toenails and I've tried it with a light translucent white or beige to help correct discolored nails with a nutral looking finish."
187672,1,I am obsessed with Prestige eyeliners. They have an awesome color variety and they last.Prestige eyeliner is a part of my daily makeup routine.
132944,0,"This has true grit-as it has large bits of exfoliating warriors. Much too tough for my skin. It feels comparable to St. Ives, which I have been told actually tears the outer layer of your dermis- not good. Now this is all natural, so it may not have that harsh of effect, but I just don't like it. It's perfect for my husband's face however. He actually gets a good scrub. I will stick with the Aveeno face scrubs as the grit is substantial, but not harsh. Oh and the smell is definitely strong of cloves, not orange."
74959,0,"Like a lot of people I heard about this product from Howard Stern, who just loves it. I don't particularly like the idea of painting my armpits with aluminum every day, so I thought it was worth a try.Right off the bat, this stuff is fairly strongly scented. It's not overpowering, but you'll be aware of it all day. I usually buy unscented antiperspirant, so this was a bit of an adjustment for me.Is it effective? I thought so at first, and for the first few days it seemed to do an admirable job. But by the end of the week, I was finding myself ""not so fresh"" at the end of the day. Mind you, I work in a air conditioned studio all day and don't have much if any physical exertion during the course of a workday. For anybody who has a more physical job, or works outdoors or in a warm environment, this stuff simply wouldn't cut it.I bought a few bottles, so I'll probably try using it for a few days, then alternate with my usual Almay for a day or two. At least I can reduce my aluminum exposure.Bottom line, this product is worth a try. Keep your expectations low though."
150028,0,"This is a very pleasant scent. More floral than traditional musk. The formulation is rather oily, not the thick ""stays put"" fragrance oils that I usually buy. The sillage isn't great unless you really rub it on and I've found that the smell fades after only an hour. If you are a fan on more ""animalistic"" musks, then this one is not for you."
118919,0,"I bought this after seeing the infomericial and then reading all the good reviews on AMAZON.Since I have monthly facials, I am acquainted with the commercial size machine and how it works. However, after trying the 'at home' version, far from the smooth texture I experience after my professional facial, I found that it caused mild breakouts and generally my skin looked rough and blotchy.While the pamphlet that comes with the derma wand did warn of the possibility of redness or broken capillaries, it never mentioned anything about skin possibly becoming oily and prone to breakouts. I noticed however that other reviewers reported similar experiences, so at least I'm not alone. I've decided therefore to take a chance and establish a regular routine. Hopefully my reaction is temporary and I will eventually see similar results to what I get from my professional facials.On another note, if anyone has experienced firming or toning of any other areas from using this product, namely upper arms or thighs, I would love to know. After all, part of the advertising for this product is that it works well on other areas of the body as well."
168538,1,"Although this is expensive a little goes along way and it is amazing! Nice even coverage without being oily or looking like ""Make-up"", It is so natural looking and light. I doubt I will use any other foundations than Airflash by Dior."

3739,0,"I love Dr.Hauschka products and wanted this to be the right cream for me...the size, the ingredients, the smell...all terrific. Unfortunately it irritated my dry sensitive skin and was nowhere near moisturizing enough. Sad. Had to return it."
30424,2,"God! Do you really expect anyone to purchase this product with the visuals you offer? They look like the ""before"" pictures from a hospital burn unit....."
59411,0,"Just received this today. It seems fine diluted 4/1 as a hand soap, but that is the only way I have used it so far.I am totally stymied by all the ridiculous religous crap that is written all over the label IN PLACE OF directions for uses of and dilutions of this soap.Some might find this humorous or even inspiring (??); I find it annoying. I had to go online to get ideas about how to use this and how it should be diluted.It remains to be seen, after I have recovered from my initial crankiness, if I will be a real fan. So far, Dr. Bronner himself really turns me off!"
11314,2,"This product is pointless, don't waste your money. It doesn't do anything significant. I tried to return it to get my money back but I was past the return date. Invest in a good pore cleansing scrub or Biore pore strips but don't waste your money on this!!"
142854,0,"I have this in the ALL NIGHT LONG shade. It is a nice shade: plummy/wine semi-sheer. It goes on nice, but barely lasts fifteen minutes. My biggest gripe aside from the price is that this gloss had a nasty smell and taste. Like burnt plastic. Just YUCK!"
939,0,"First of all, the cord is way too long. Second, the high setting went the second time I used it so now the high is like the low. The good thing is I like the way this straightens. You have to have your hair partially dry for it to work the best because it really doesn't dry really wet hair. So, my final thought is the concept is good but there needs to be improvements made in order to perfect it."
167615,0,"I've owned this straightner for about 2 years, and it works okay but I have to spend like an hour to get it perfect and it doesn't last all day like I would like. I have medium lenth wavy/curly/straight hair and although it makes your hair super smooth and shiny, I don't think that I would reccomend it for those who don't have a long time in the morning to make it perfect, but it is an okay straightner. I bought an Andis straightner today that I am hoping works better."
188590,1,"I wish i would have had this years ago! I ordered the C2. I have blue eyes, blonde hair and fair/med skin tone. This has a more yellow base and is PERFECT! It settles in for a flawless finish. I will never be w/o this product."
132499,0,"These met my needs for the most part, but the sprayer tends to drip more than other bottles I have. One of them had to be tossed as it dripped so bad it was useless. I guess for the price they are meeting my needs. Time will tell - one of them is now kind of clogged up and had to be tossed after using for a month. So, I guess you get what you pay for. Again, Ok for the money. I might even buy them again if needed due to the cheap price."
27910,2,"I had been using Minoxidil 5% for a few months and realized that I was just getting too much dandruff. I read in one of the reviews that this product doesn't have the extreme side effects of Minoxidil 5%. So, I decided to start using Minoxidil 2% instead in hopes that I could continue to grow back some hair without having dandruff all over my shirt at the end of the day. Little did I know that there is a HUGE difference between unscented and regular versions of this product. The package arrived sooner than I had anticipated and exactly as I'd ordered. So, I wouldn't want to make it seem like the seller was irresponsible.However, a few minutes after I applied the solution I noticed a sour smell. After a couple of hours the odor became unbearable and made me sick. It smelled like the most pungent rotten egg smell I could possibly imagine and it stayed that bad for over two full days even though I only used about 3/4 of a mL (which, in theory, is less than half a day's supply). I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that using this product has been a fairly traumatic experience. Not only did the smell make me sick it made others around me sick. I have had to avoid public contact for the last three days. I began scrubbing my scalp with a baking powder and water paste (with only small positive results) every few hours for about a 24 hour period. However, that seems to be drying my scalp out and making me lose some of the hair I'd recently begun to grow back.I would not recommend this product to anyone. I may have just had a bad reaction to it based on the condition of my scalp, but the smell was completely rancid. I've since purchased an unscented version from the drug store and hope that I can put this experience behind me."
170920,0,its a very streaky and thin. i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage! i get so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter. still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)
164455,2,"If you make a mistake and need to return the product, totally unused and in the same condition received, you must be given permission to do so. When speaking to the representative I was refused permission; I was told that I didn't know what I was speaking about and I should just go ahead and use the product, etc. I had to get Amazon Customer Service involved."

8401,1,"Years ago I used Cachet all the time and loved it. I haven't been able to find it in any local stores so I pretty much gave up on ever finding it again. One day before Christmas my husband asked if I had tried to find the Cachet at Amazon. Oh my, it's there! I was so excited! He told me that if I wanted a bottle than go ahead and order one and it would be a Christmas gift. Well, I love Cachet so much that I jumped at that offer from my husband but, instead of buying one bottle of Cachet, I purchased two. I was so excited! When the order arrived at my house, I couldn't resist, I had to open both bottles and test to make sure they were the real Cachet and in good condition. Thank you Amazon!"
82441,1,"This really does what it says. I was looking into the specialized stainless steel underarm deodorizer but they were 30 bucks or more. I work hard and sweat a lot and my deodorant never seemed to catch up. I tried this and could tell a difference after one use. I no longer wear deodorant (glad to not be putting the aluminum on my body) and this soap keeps me feeling and smelling fresh. One note for users If you have been using and antiperspirant/deodorant it is tough to wash off. This bar only works if you totally remove everything from you skin before use. Oh, and works great on kitchen smells on hands, too!"
6925,2,"I DID NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THAT I HAD ORDERED, I HAD ORDERED ""ANGEL--CELESTIAL BODY LOTION"" WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SHOWN ON LINE, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS ""ANGEL PERFUMING BODY LOTION"" NOT AT ALL WHAT I WANTED--SO I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND, HAD TO ORDER FROM ANOTHER SITE TO GET THE CORRECT ORDER. VERY VERY DISAPOINTED--THE PRODUCT SHOWN WAS NOT THE PRODUCT SENT.IN THE FUTURE I WILL ORDER FROM THE OTHER SITE, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SENDER SENDS OUT THE PRODUCT THAT IS ADVERTISED, AS THESE TWO PRODUCT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, THIERRY MUGLER,,,BUT NOT THE SAME PRODUCT."

111732,0,"This dryer was great when I first bought it. It's easy to use, dries evenly, and my hair is soft, straight, and beautiful. I have very thick, curly, coarse hair but this dryer worked just fine. I'm dyslexic with a round brush and dryer, so having both in one appliance is great.Note: I've noticed that some people have had issues keeping the brush attached to the dryer. The key is to keep turning the brush until you hear a loud CLICK and it's snugly inside the barrel. Otherwise, it's apt to fly off while you're doing your hair and burn your hand. Not fun!Over time, the brush bristles have started to collapse into the barrel, which makes the whole process a pain. I've had it since June and it's now October, so I guess that's okay for the 15 or so bucks I paid for it."
104536,0,"love this cologne by ck, it's one of my favorites of all the various fragrances he sells. great price too"
235614,1,"This scent has got to be the cleanest, softest, most feminine I have ever used and I've been hooked for about 10 years."
108753,0,"I tried this product a while back. What I liked about this product was that it gave me an instant tan. However, the instructions said that I had to wipe the tip of the spraying gun after every spray. Also, I had to protect the surrounding furnitures with newspaper, so that they wouldn't stain, so it wasn't too convenient for me. Other than that, I thought this was a different tanning product that worked. I stick with the tanning lotions though."
200240,0,"So far, so good. It certainly gives full look results. I've used it about 3 times within a week. But, I'm not sure if frequent use of this product would hinder healthy hair growth."
76399,0,"I bought this after I had shoulder surgery, thinking I could style my hair using only one arm. Not so. The brush would not &#34;catch&#34; my hair unless I used a second hand to wrap it onto the brush. I ultimately had to use the double comb attachment, which was not fully satisfactory either. I had memories of my first blow dryer, which was a Conair Max, or something similr, which was a smaller form factor and which I could use just like a hairbrush, but this was definitely not it."
128538,2,"I absolutely love Elizabeth Arden's perfume Red door. I have been using it for many years. I decided to try the body cream and was very disappointed. The smell is not pleasing. It stinks actually. If I could get my money back, I would. It doesn't smell anything like the perfume. All I can say is enter at your own risk...."
26530,0,"I have this and like it. I wish it would make my curls tighter, but that is ok. Otherwise still a really good curling additive and it smells nice too. Would buy again!"
71613,0,"I bought this shade because the shade I was using which I believe was 9-1/2 NB, for Natural Blonde, would end up with gold or red highlights as it wore between colorings. I thought this shade would help neutralize that reddish shade. Too much!!!!! This color comes out a very ashy grayish blonde, not really beige until I've washed it for about two weeks and the color fades some. It definitely does away with the red/gold tint, but waaaaay too much. I'm switching colors back to a natural blonde shade. No more beige for this girl. But the formula itself, independent of the color, works very well and is easy to put on. It's very drip resistant so it doesn't make a mess everywhere. It seems to leave my hair in fairly decent shape as well and the after color conditioner is helpful too and smells good. Much cheaper than a salon and does a good job if you take the time to apply it carefully."
250836,2,"I reluctantly ordered this mirror after bad reviews. This mirror is mounted in my bathroom and I have discovered a major design flaw. The swivel between the mirror and the wall mount is a screw type swivel which tightens or looses depending on the was you adjust the mirror over time. If you normally turn the mirror in one direction for use, the screw will eventually become over tightened and break from the mount which renders it useless. I had to dismount the mirror and fashion a new swivel out of a bolt and nut. I do not recommend buying this mirror."
236951,0,This works similar to the Proactiv sulfur mask for me. I dip a q-tip down in to the liquid and then cover my zit(s) with a pretty decent layer of it.Over a day or so it definitely shrinks them down a bit.
126821,0,"My hair is naturally a shade of light brown. I got highlights for a few years but I decided to go back to my natural color. I was tired of having the roots and tips of my hair different shades (my roots went past my ears) so I resorted to doing it myself with Garnier Nutrisse. My hair color is even now. Since it is a ""golden"" shade my hair had an a lot of new red tones in it. A few people told me that it was kind of like a light shade of auburn. It was fun for awhile. It fades pretty fast (which most of us expect) :). My intent was to darken my hair a little bit, but six or seven weeks have past and I would say my hair is lighter than when I started. I think it has to do with the shade that I picked. I'm not really into having so much red in my hair and I would prefer having it darker. If I were to use nutrisse again I would probably use #50 or #51. I think my next hair coloring venture will involve Garnier Herbashine (maybe #500) though. We'll see how that goes."
118193,1,"At around $120 a bottle, you really need to know if it works or not. It works - but in a limited way. It certainly minimalizes puffiness under the eyes - it does a great job, but other products can do the same thing for less. As for minimalizing fine lines around the eyes, it does to a small degree. On me, it worked only on very fine lines but maybe you need deeper lines to see more drastic results. One big caution is that if you apply make-up over this product, you have to use an extremely light touch or you end up undoing all the tightening provided by this lotion.You only have to apply a very small amount (half pump) or else it will dry a flakey white. This is a good thing and will help make the bottle last for at least six months if used on a daily basis.I'm not against paying top dollar for products that work (Le Mer lotion is worth every penny at $210). I used to buy two jars a year but have recently stopped due to the cost/result ratio (for the amount it costs, I want more visible results).I highly recommend it for getting rid of under eye puffiness or deep shadows (in conjunction with concealer). You really need to go to Sephora, Saks Fifth Avenue or anywhere else where you can sample it first and see how it works for you before making the investment. Then buy it here as Amazon.com does have the best price (it's NEVER on sale at stores)."
15741,0,"I think is a so-so brush because is really strong on your hair, I was expecting a lot more from this brush and when I got it I felt disapointed because the bristles are really tough on your hair and they feel plastic"

114135,0,"I purchased a 3-piece set of Demeter's fragrance which contained, Fresh Ginger, Ginseng Root, and Green Tea. Green Tea was the worst of the 3 scents, because something in it gave me a terrible headache: Trashed it. Ginseng Root has a somewhat musty, incense? smell to it: Not too bad, but I am not sure about this one. Fresh Ginger is the best of the 3 scents. Fresh Ginger has an earthy, woody, and somewhat mysterious note to it and it does NOT give me a headache....in fact, as I write this comment, I sprayed Fresh Ginger on my wrist, and LOVE the scent. It is one of the best fragrances that I have tried; however, I am not sure that it is going to be my signature scent, because whenever I wear it away from home, most people sniff at me, and noone asks me about the fragrance; so, I guess (some?) they don't particularly care for it. I think that I will try Fresh Laundry or Pure Soap next, because many people seem to give very good reviews about these fragrances: particularly Fresh Laundry.I am trying to find THEEE fragrance (or two), but I am somewhat cautious about many fragrances, because they usually give me a headache. Strangely, I thought that musk was the culprit, but I am not certain about this as I have white musk (albeit an old bottle of about 10 years which may have weakened the scent?) by The Body Shop and I tested it by spritzing on my wrist and smelled it multiple times to see what affect (if any) the musk would have towards my sinus area. Well, after a few hours of intermittent wrist-smelling, I finally had a headache. I alternatively, did this without smelling my wrist, and noticed that I had no headache. So, I guess spraying on the wrist, and probably not near the nose (neck, ears, hair) is my best bet, unless it is not just musk which gives me a headache."
127187,0,"I have oily, greasy skin about 2 hours after applying makeup. Miserable.This product keeps oil at bay a few hours longer. Decent, but not great.I have since discovered Origins, which produces a mattifying liquid that I'd say works ten times better."

184208,1,"I bought this wanting to replicate the Tiffany & Co. blue color. It's really as close as you can get. It's similar to a Chanel color (though I'm not sure what it's called). This is my first time using China glaze and I'm quite impressed. It seems to last just as long as OPI if not longer. If you put on 2 coats it shouldn't look streaky plus it matches the Tiffany color with the 2 coats. All in all, it's a great product!"

Even with the perfect razor and shaving cream, I still get a little irritation, sometimes, and this is the only ""calming"" solution that helps.

Using the spray bottle allows me to waste less product, compared to using a cotton ball or pad (or even just palming it on)."

The product is not /bad/, but it's not the best either. I have short and straight lashes so it has always been troublesome to keep them up and curved. Maybe I just haven't mastered at using this heater. It does lift my lashes a bit but they don't stay curled much."
35743,1,I do read lots of reviews and have yet to buy a bad product off of amazon. I bought this for a friend and she says she loves it.

I find the wax melts very fast after the first time - before I put it away, when the wax is semi-hardened, I run a butter knife around the edges... and I get dip-able wax in about 30-40 minutes when I reheat it on high setting.It feels good and my hands look good, very soft and smooth and I also use it for my feet. Interestingly, my feet seem to hold the heat for quite a while after I peel the wax off. The first several times I used it, I didn't see any real changes - it just felt so good I kept using it - but now my feet are looking smoother than I've ever seen them. I now understand why people get these treatments at spas. My cuticles are no longer dry and splitting either.I came back to order another one for a friend and I see they are out of stock on the $25 price. :("
102404,1,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but I like the iron's ability to do wet or dry hair. I have fine & thin hair, so being able to skip the blow-drying is a great thing. I am noticing that I can add one more day between shampoos & my hair is clean & shiny all the while. Would recommend the product."
168186,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
74833,0,"I ordered this eau de parfum because I'd previously ordered ""Lavender Eyes"" by Elizabeth Taylor, and I love that fragrance. ""Forever Elizabeth"" is a lovely scent, but, within a few minutes after I put it on, the fragrance is gone. Too bad that it doesn't last - that's why I gave it only 3 stars."

While my friends love the smell, my girlfriend isn't a big fan of it, because she thinks that it's a bit too old for me.I tend to use this cologne in winter, and prefer lighter or sweeter smells in other seasons."

215184,0,"I have extremely fine, straight hair and get highlights a few times a year. My hairstylist gave me some samples of this shampoo and conditioner to try. When I tried the samples, I thought it was helping with both the color fading and volume. But since using this shampoo on an almost daily use, I really haven't noticed an increase in volume. I'm sure it's just my hair because very few products seem to help me with volume. This shampoo smells great and my hair does feel clean after I use it, but I really need help with volume. When I finish with this bottle, I'm unsure if I'll re-order or not."
52164,0,"WAIT! Before you buy your next product read this first! The best of the best product I've found is Aveda Men's Grooming Clay, a superior product on short and long hair for men or women. It's not at all greasy, it's got more of a resin feel without stickyness and a pleasant light herbal smell that's hard to detect but fresh all the time. Volcanic clay is firm but soft in the jar, offers tremendous hold and has been around quite some time for a reason - it works! A little goes a long way and even if you use a bit too much, you will not have a slick greasy look. It's a great product to help keep heavier textured hair in place for all kinds of updo's and ponytails whether neat or toussled. It adds unreal volume if you want it. I have alot of medium length very textured bone-straight hair that can defy gravity with this product. I use a building technique that takes less than 2 minutes, and only in the roots - I rub a dime-sized amount in my palms to slightly warm and emulsify it and with fingertips I work the crown first, a little more in the palms and work it in the sides from ears up through the temple area, then a tiny bit more from the nape of my neck to the ears, connecting all of the zones in stages. I then kind of join it all together using my fingertips in the roots on a once over shake it out then style it any way I want. Most of the time, it's in a French Twist with a large clip or hair sticks. Makes a great heightened more sophisticated look with bobby pins, too, but without being overly done. I let sections fall around my face and my bangs look piecey. It washes out wonderfully with shampoo. It's even better on day 2 after sleeping on it and adding just a tiny bit to refresh it. I can clay up and create a great twist in less than 10 minutes! Seriously, you want a great contemporary matte finish look with a bedhead flair, get Aveda Grooming Clay not wax."

32850,1,"I have been using frownies on and off for over a year. I had a wrinkle between my eyebrows that was so deep the lady who waxes my eyebrows asked if it was a scar. I tried every cream and serum you could get. I think I spent over $1000 on eye creams and wrinkle creams that my boyfriend asked why I didn't just get botox. I bought frownies from drugstore.com based on the reviews there. I honestly didn't think it would work. How could something that cost $14 work better than the $50 creams and serums I've been using? It took about 2 months of constant overnight use but my scar like wrinkle is completely gone and hasn't come back yet. I pulled the frownies out of my cupboard recently because I am noticing crowsfeet. I'm 36 and my skin is so sensitive that I can only take them off in the shower. They are uncomfortable at first, but for the benefits I'm ok with a little discomfort. Your face has to be clean in the area you put the frownies on otherwise they won't stick. Don't wet them a lot (I just wet my finger and run it along the adhesive side) and spread your skin so the wrinkles aren't there before you stick them on. Hold the frownies down on your skin for about 3 minutes until it feels like its firmly attached. I apply them about 30 minutes before I go to bed and they stay on all night."

I'll stick with Neutrogena's Healthy Skin Custom Glow Blush & Bronzer in Natural Glow, and then top off with a light dusting of NARS' Orgasm. NARS' Orgasm really is the most beatiful blush on the market...& works perfectly with every skintone."
207298,1,I purchased Aruba blue and boy do I love it!! it's the perfect cobalt blue. I have caramel skin and it went well with my complexion. My mother who is fairer tried this on and it looked just as amazing on her. I think any girl of any shade can rock this color.
21638,0,"This mask is very DIFFICULT to apply to your face. It's made of natural products which is great, but this product was not effective as I wished. The people at Earthwise are very helpful and understanding and will refund my money. So really, try this mask out. You have nothing to lose"
105948,0,"This cream did not work as well as I had hoped. The smell and texture was unpleasant and I did not see any changes as the jar promised. Was not that moisterizing either, I need more water in my skin, not oil or the slick substance that was in this product. I looked forward to using it up!"
81680,1,"I love love love this scent. I first went through a 1 oz bottle, wanted more, then bought the 3.4 oz size. I still really love the fragrance, but it lasts all of 20 seconds. I literally can spray my entire room, all my bedding and pillows, my clothes and head, spray some into my air conditioner, heater, whatever, then walk away, and come back into my room a minute later and not smell it at all. I feel like maybe the smaller size bottle was more potent, but I could just be imagining it. If they could create a longer-lasting perfume version I would be hooked for life. p.s. the bottle is very pretty..the shiny pink swirly is nice and I like that it's a simple shape and isnt covered in big cheesy flowers or something."

158895,2,"I have tried lots of natural hair washes and conditioners over the years, but none of them can really compare to the good chemical brands. They are really in two different classes. If I compare this product to other natural brands, I would say it is about average and nothing special. It leaves my hair heavy and tangled, not light, brushable and bouncy. I went back to Pantene and put this in the Kiss my Face in the guest bathroom.Comment Comment | Permalink"
238541,2,"Very very light scent that smells like nothing but cloves. Should be sprayed on ham, not the body, am very disappointed."
136681,2,"I bought this and after the first use I decided not to use it. I have natural curly hair and I relax it because I just prefer straight hair all the time. As soon as I wash the shampoo out of my hair, my hair was ridiculously stiff. I tried to put more shampoo thinking it would help loosen it up and still didn't work. I ended up just using my herbal essence conditioner to loosen it up. Terrible. Do not recommend."
84467,0,"This conditioner is great for dandruff or dry scalp. It tingles when you use it and makes your hair shiny and with minimal breakage.Do not use on color-treated hair. It contains ""mint"" which will make your hair fade & use its vibrant color. I used this product and found out the hard way. I used to dye my hair blonde and it would make my color fade fast! I ended up letting my husband use it (so we aren't wasting it) and I discontinued the use. Tea-tree is an excellent choice for dry scalp, just use one without mint if you have color-treated hair."
147348,2,Other reviewers were right here...After a few months they start to pull the hair (went dull I guess). They say do not oil...so I didn't. Just threw them out and just purchased another brand that had higher ratings.

117177,0,"I am a huge Philosophy fan, so when I got a gift certificate to Amazon, I immediately thought of getting perfume and body wash. Should have smelled it before I bought it. It's not bad smelling--just a little TOO sweet for me. Sweeter than cotton candy, almost makes my mouth pucker. Not bad, but not my favorite by any means."
22827,1,"I have had an item similar to this for years and always hoped that mine didn't dissappear because I never saw another like it. I still haven't, but this is the closest I have seen. It's just a bit shorter and the ""spikes"" are too, but good enough! Great find!"
241589,0,It claimed it will take a while to make the scar go away. Haven't seen any result on my kids yet
155138,0,It may still be a bit early for this review which is why I am giving it a middle of the road (3 star) review -I have only been using the product for several weeks. I do not notice any improvement yet in the age spots on my face.
151104,1,We used these during our 6 month trip around the world and it does a great job of blocking out light. There are even pockets on it for putting ear plugs in. Definitely recommended

154615,1,"beautyblender Blender Sponge Canister 1 eaThis is a fantastic make up sponge, its the least messy way to apply liquid foundation that I have found.You use the big round end to stipple the foundation onto your skin to give a wonderful even finish.The smaller end can be used round the nose and eye area. I will never go back to normal make up sponges or using my fingers. I also find I use less foundation.The only drawback is that it seems to make applying foundation to your neck a little more akward, I use my fingers for this."
212132,0,Regular Curve is better as the smell last longer on you where this Soul seems kind of weak. But the price was right and makes a good everyday user after shaving.
114090,2,"I bought it in the middle of December 2006. Today June 18, 2007, I turned it on to use it and it burned out and smoke was coming from the vents. The plastic around the slot the tube goes into broke twice..had no choice but to stitch it with thread to keep it attached to the plastic cap. So disappointed with this product. Don't buy it. Better to spend the money and buy professional. This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it."
8118,0,"I have fine hair but a lot of it and it holds water so it takes forever to dry. I have had my hair dried in salons with hairdryers that are so good it makes it unnecessary to use a flat iron. Products are also necessary but I use the same products and notice the hairdryer had made a difference. Unfortunately I didn't ask what kind it was at the time as I was satisfied enough with my drugstore hairdryer. Since its passing, I've been interested in finding something that will be light, quiet, cut drying time down and produce sleek shiny hair without burning it. Probably doesn't exist. So I decide the result and drying time is most important to me. This is my second Solano to try because I am pretty sure that's what was used the last time I was impressed by a hair dryer. It is not &#34;light&#34; but not bad. The sound is low not shrill and it is quiet, for a hairdryer. For me there can be one item within a brand that works well, even if everything else they make doesn't. That said, I'm tempted to try Sedu, Chi or Babyliss because the Solanos I've tried don't seem to provide results I've had before and I think it's because they don't get hot enough. However, at Ulta only the Chi seemed to get hotter and so hot it was scalding which might burn hair and scalp. The rep said the T3 worked but that was fifty more so it might have been an upsale. If you can't find a great hairdryer for under 150 there is something up. If they would list dryers by weight, air temperature and air force or make custom one since everyone's hair type is different that would be helpful. If anyone has any suggestions that would be appreciated."

135142,0,"This product has great-sized rollers for long hair and average heat-up time (slower than advertised). But what happened to the ability to order extra rollers at Conair? You can order clips or clamps, but no extra rollers.I have substituted a similar size and style roller from another unit, in order to get the number I need. Extra rollers take up less room to pack.I have been using Conair products for 20 years, and as a Flight Attendant, I have had rollers and hair dryers with me on the go. The base electrical portion of the unit always outlasts the inadequate lids. I live with the lids until they crack, but they eventually fall off. Do you get the message Conair? Develop a hard plastic top or use something else.I am glad to have the dual voltage, now just fix that top and let us order extra rollers."
41500,0,"The straightening attachment was a little disappointing. However, the heat produced by the dryer is phenomenal, so much so, that it makes it difficult to hold the hair in place so that it can be straightened properly. The dryer in conjunction with the concentrator attachment works wonderfully. So I rated it 3 stars because I hoping for better results from the straightener."

243269,0,"This conditioner may be working to make my hair look thicker (my boyfriend thinks it does), but it doesn't seem to actually condition my hair. It smells really weird/unpleasant - almost dusty - and it leaves my hair glued to my head. My normally curly hair doesn't curl as well with this conditioner and is kind of stuck together like a helmet.It also seems to burn my scalp. I use it with the Murad shampoo, so maybe it's the combination of this conditioner with the shampoo, but wherever it touches my skin (face, neck) it leaves it feeling irritated and pink. It hurts less now (~3 month in) than when I started, but it's still not a pleasant experience.So why give it 3 stars? It seems to make my hair look thicker. I don't see it, but others said they do and so far I haven't found any better options for my super fine/thin hair."
136135,2,"I used to sell Mary Kay and some people love this stuff, swear by it, and well, honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about. I only ordered it sparingly because I just couldn't recommend someone buy something that I thought was overpriced and didn't work well. I think it is WAY overpriced for the small 3 ounce size, and the smell, yuck! Kinda like an antiseptic. It does a fair job of moisturizing, sorta like using Vaseline lotion. You'll be reapplying it time and time again if you have very dry skin like mine. For my buck and very sensitive skin, you can't beat Gold Bond's hand lotion. It last forever and heals your hands almost overnight. This stuff, well again, get more for your money and something that works and grab the Gold Bond instead. At least you won't stink the rest of the day and your hands will feel much, much better!"
234865,1,I was very pleased with the products I received and they got here very fast! I also loved the professional-looking note that came in my package. I will most defiantly order from them again. Thank you so much!
170731,0,"This particular color is just okay. Nothing terribly special, but cute enough. I didn't expect that it was going to be as glittery as it was, and I tend to lean more towards the solid colors -- it is a bit darker and far, far more glittery than the product image shows. As with most things, that is all taste subjective though. This color seems to take twice the time to dry that any of my others from China Glaze do, and even when I think it is good to go, I will end up smudging it somehow 30 minutes later.Bottom line: definitely cute looking, but not a favorite and not one that I would purchase again."
113306,1,"I was skeptical that this 1300 watt dryer would do the job of typical 1850 watt models but the CHI does an excellent job -- even with the heat setting switched off. Although this is the most expensive hair dryer I've purchased, I'm totally satisfied with the results so far. Excellent build quality and perfect size makes it well worth the money."
203791,2,"I bought this product with high hopes for my long, thick hair, but you've got to use so much of it, that its just ridiculous--the directions say something like 20-30 pumps for one wash. My hair still felt a little slimy afterwards, too. I am a hair stylist, so I've tried many different professional products, and although the concept of this product is good, I just can't see the value in it when you've got to use so much of it every time you wash your hair. You're better off investing in a very gentle shampoo and a rich, moisturizing conditioner..."
120562,1,"I started using this because my dermatologist sells it in the office. It's much cheaper on Amazon of course. The coverage is full if you apply it with a Kabuki brush. My trick is to start with a neutral shade first on my trouble spots (natural/neutral), then cover my face with a lighter shade (ivory) and blend well. It is hard to get the ivory shade to cover much, it almost could be named translucent instead of ivory because it feels so much lighter than the other shades do. I finish with the rice powder to set and reduce shine. If you are still shiny at the end of the day, I was told that some use the rice powder both under the foundation and also as the finishing powder.I have horrible acne and this does not aggravate my skin, and still provides decent coverage. I used to have a messy thick layer of liquid foundation on everyday. There I something freeing about switching to the mineral powder - you don't feel so artificial and you're not hiding your skin completely, it can still breathe. Are you going to get full heavy coverage like a liquid - no. however, try it on a weekend or something and ease your way into it daily. I have deep red scars on my cheeks and if it will cover those, I think it will cover nearly anything. good luck!"
20627,0,"Pain is subjective with this product- personally it did not hurt, but for my mother and sister, well, they're not willing to try it out after one try. I'm not sure if it is working (about two small pimples I've treated over two days are gone) as only half the pimples treated went away. it does dry up the area so using a good lotion 30 mins afterwards was helpful."
133752,2,"I was looking for a leave in conditioner that I could use on both wet and dry hair. I have very curly hair and a lot of it, and I have very hard time brushing it when wet...this product made brushing MUCH harder and I ended up with a comb full of hair by the time I was done....I really wanted to like but have to give it 2 stars...The smell is great, but it lingers on for days and will interfere with any other scents you put on."

58019,0,"I am unable to use harsh cleansers with a lot of chemicals, since they make me break out. These bars are basic cleansers that do the job and I don't break out with them. I don't think I will buy them again though because they are a little too drying."
240085,2,"I am a HUGE SkinCeuticals fan and use many of the products from the skin care line. However, this is a weak link in their offering IMO. Unlike other self-tanners, I found this one wore of unevenly, leaving an unattractive ""splotchiness"" (glad I tested first!). Perhaps I did something wrong, but I have used many self-tanners and found this one the least successful in terms of both color and even-ness. I do recommend Clarins, though I've never used the gel (here): Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel. That said, I highly recommend any of the following from SkinCeuticals, all of which I have found to be excellent products: SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic - 1 oz,SkinCeuticals Hydrating B5 Gel - 30 ml, SkinCeuticals Daily Moisture - 60 ml, SkinCeuticals Intense Line Defense - 30 ml, or almost anything in the skin care department."
72034,1,"Cake eyeliner has been very, very hard to find since it was basically replaced with eyeliner pencils and bottles of liner a few years ago. I have always hated the pencils, but had no choice since the bottled eyeliners looked so harsh on me. The pencils tug at the delicate skin around the eyes and probably cause wrinkles for a lot of people. They basically wear off after about 3 hours and need to be reapplied. On cooler days, they need to be heated up with a hairdryer in order for them to work at all. Annoying!!! So I was really intrigued to find the Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner on the Internet and decided to take a gamble, figuring I'd probably toss it right in the trash after trying it. I have heard that makeup artists prefer cake eyeliner and now I know why! When I applied it for the first time, I could not believe my eyes. This product is SO superior to any type of eyeliner I have ever used. It's a breeze to apply, it is easy to draw the line and control the color and intensity and shape of the line. Applying it takes about 1/3 of the time I used to spend fooling with the pencil, trying to sharpen the pencil, often ending up with a mess and having to resharpen and resharpen, not to mention making corrections since the pencil is so easy to mess up. Once you've drawn the line with this liner, you can easily take the brush and fan it, creating a soft, natural, look or even go right over it again to make it more intense. Contrary to what a lot of people say here, I find it extremely easy to remove and love the fact that it stays on until I take it off. The best part is my eyes look amazing, not at all harsh or fake-looking. I hope everyone will buy this product so that they will keep making it. But I'm not taking any chances, I'm buying about 50 of these so I never run out. Cake eyeliner is a really good value, it lasts for a very long time and that's probably why they decided to take it away from us for so many years. If you want your eyes to look great and want to save yourself a lot of time and money, you should definitely try this product! Don't listen to the few negative reviewers here or you could miss out on a product that will change your life for the better!"

184114,0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."

167092,2,It was nothing like the picture. I thought the bottom white part would come with it but it didn't so I have to hook it up to the chair which stinks because it keeps falling off. But you get what you pay for. It was only like 9 bucks.
137670,0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
240533,0,this is at best an ok brush to just leave in the car. the bristles are just a bit too soft for my liking and they stink. I love the spacing on the bristles which keep the brush from getting too dirty and if it does; it's very easy to clean. when the bristles get wet they have a unpleasant odor. it's actually difficult to find a descent brush that has the perfect firmness to it. this brush constantly leaves bristles in my hairPROS:smallnice black finishno handleperfect for a touch up brush to be left in the carperfectly spaced bristlesCONS:bristles have foul odor when wetbristles often fall out while brushingnot quite firm enoughOVERALL:i will likely order a few more just for leaving one in each of my cars. It's kinda too soft but that's better than too hard i guess
7612,2,I bought Mildew thinking it would smell sort of like damp towels that had been in the bathroom for a couple of days but was disappointed to find it smelled more like sports liniment. Will next try thunderstorm.
147826,2,Before this order.. Everyone recommended me NOT to order fragrances from Amazon ..But being a lazy and had trust on Amazon I have ordered this from Amazon and realized I really made a mistake .. because fragrance does not really stay longer than 1 hour...I used eternity before and that have log lasting fragrance and that I bought from Calvin Klein storeShipping was great .. I got this on next day only...but not happy with the quality of this..
169573,0,this stuff smells good but it smells exaclty like Paul Sebation cologne. you can pick up a bottle of paul sebation for about 20$ less the the Tiffany brand. both are designer brands. 35$ vs 55$
45725,0,"The bottle of Tunisian amber arrived very promptly from Attar Bazaar.Unfortunately it didn't smell quite the same as previously.It was still spicy and warming, but there was an acridity at the end that wasn't there before.If I can't find Tunisian amber in another brand, I will restock with Attar Bazaar."
143742,0,"I was really excited about this purchase. I have heard many great things about this product and wanted to give it a try. After ordering it off of Amazon it came in the mail a week later. My first impression was ""Wow. This smells a lot like chocolate!"". It says it is safe to put it anywhere on your body so I put some on my face to help get rid of my dry skin that I have been getting from a new acne treatment I have recently started to use. For the record, My skin is sensitive, and oily around my T-zone (unless of course my medication is taking the oil away from my face). This stuff made my skin more oily and made my skin burn and turned red with irritation. I don't believe it was actually the product itself that made my skin burn. I think my skin burned because I was using Tretinoin cream for my acne and it wasn't working well with this product. I wouldn't recommend using this product on your face if you have oily skin or are using some kind of medication/treatment (such as acne medication). Though, I will say, I LOVE putting this stuff on my hands, elbows, and knees. Keeps them nice and smooth (a tad bit greasy but defiantly making your skin look and feel healthy and hydrated- especially during the winter seasons!)."

It was completely defective. I contacted the seller and he insisted that i replaced the new one he sent me with one i had already owned. He emailed me a few very vulgar nasty emails so i filed a complaint with amazon and am still awaiting a refund!"

156679,1,I absolutely LOVE this color! It is actually pretty hard to find. It was a good price and shipped fast.
75374,2,"From an African American hair texture point of view...not all that its hyped up to be. I decided to make a go after the sample sizes, because I was not sure if I wanted to pay the fifty something dollars for shampoo and conditioner. I was highly disappointed and not to mention it did not leave my hair any softer then when I've used other products with olive olive, proteins and aloe in them. It actually felt very drying to my hair. I guess if you have oily hair this is a wonderful product for you to use, but not for all hair textures across the board. I did give it 2 stars though, because it did do a good job of clarifying. I was excited to receive this product because of its natural ingredients, but I question its purity. For me it was a big NO."
83828,1,"These are the best cleansing cloths that I have tried. I have combination skin that tends to be sensitive, and these cloths do not irritate my skin. They leave my skin soft and glowing. They can also be cut in half to conserve them. A half of the cloth is just as powerful."

213845,0,"While the actual mirror on this product has not lived up to its claim, the Zadro LED lighted Fogless Mirror is worth considering.My experience with previous ""fogless"" mirrors basically lessened my expectations for this product. Essentially, the concept is flawed as the mirrors don't stay fogless. Moreover, water spray makes using such mirrors relatively difficult.Other features make this product worth considering. The bright blue-white LED is nice in the early morning. Likewise, the LCD clock is great for keeping tabs on valuable minutes while racing to get ready for work.The mirror itself appears somewhat cheap as it is coated plastic instead of glass. Other undesirable features include an all-to-brief automatic LED shutoff, which begins to dim in a few minutes.In summary, the idea is great --- use this product to increase your morning routine productivity. Unfortunately, the execution falls short.ProsBright LightClockConsInexpensive MirrorAuto shutoff too rapid"
15887,1,"This toner is refreshing and effective, with no added chemicals that I need to be concerned about.Most drugstore brand toners and astringents contain artificial coloring and fragrance. Why would I need a brightly blue colored toner? To give my skin a blue cast?Things can be absorbed transdermally. I don't know that there is any proven harm in applying artificial color to your skin, but why take the chance?I also appreciate that there is only a minimal amount of alcohol added to this product. My skin is dry enough as it is.This is a great natural formula. I use it on a cotton ball, plus I pour some into the plastic packaging that contains facial cleansing cloths. Those cloths are typically too dry to suit me, and Dickinson's offers the perfect solution."
63155,0,"well, it did not have much effect as said in website. May be the product is good for some skin."
120176,1,I used this product on a fungal toenail with great results. I applied a drop or two twice a day. It took about 3-4 months for the nail to completely grow out but i could see healthy nail coming in during that time. My nail has been completely back to normal for the past six months or so. I would recommend this product to anyone with nail fungus.
144712,2,"I read the reviews and I gotta say, all this magical tingly feeling some people feel... I didn't feel it. My pores seemed more noticeable and my face was even a little drier, making my fine lines look not so fine. I threw it out and told my mother not to try it."
178854,1,"I have fine oily hair so I was looking for a product that I could use instead of baby powder on my blond hair. I love this product the best out of all the ones I have tried. Sometimes, however, the can's srayer stops working. I have had 4 cans and 2 of them have broken. I am going to try and contact the company to get a replacement. I like this type so much better than the Ojon brand, which smells like an old ladies product. Overall works great."

184202,2,"The Iconic Frostbite is all over the nail blogs as the ""it"" color.. frosty high luster medium blue with fire within.Well.. I don't know why but this bottle I got from here was dark.. more like a slightly shimmery navy. Not pretty on my olive skin. I was expecting the color in the blogs.. a vibrant beautiful light Royal blue.. instead.. it is quite dark.. with a slight shimmer if you put your hand in the sun... just looks like Navy cream polish...I don't know if the formula is different.. I don't know if this is a second? I don't know if the blogs lie... but you know mailing it back would just cost more than the whole thing is worth.I guess.. if you are looking for the Iconic Blue in the Blogs.. try buying in person and try on...Just looked too dark.. and was totally not what I expected.. very sad..."
108019,0,"After owning and liking Happy, I thought I'd give this a try. I got it as a Christmas present, and have worn it maybe three or four times. It's too flowery for me. I get headaches and feel like my throat is irritated whenever I wear it.I tried to love it, but I just can't... It makes a nice addition to my collection, but as for which I'd rather wear, Happy or Happy Heart, I choose Happy."
162675,0,"I have curly hair (chemically treated) and I noticed absolutely no difference using this. What's it supposed to do exactly? I've used protein treatments before (the Babyface Protein) and it was really nice. This Aphogee though, just didn't seem to make much difference in the way my hair felt at all. I wanted it too, because the spray-on application is very convenient. Oh well. Maybe just not the right product for me."
222753,2,"If you have dark thick coarse hair on your face or body this will not work for you. It only works on those thin wispy hairs. I am unfortunate to have the thick dark coarse hairs on my upper lip & chin area & I used this stuff liberally & it didn't work, I tried again & again with different methods-leaving it on longer, applying it thicker, even tried for days on end & it didn't bleach the hairs on my face at all. I wiped away the cream & there was still black hairs there. It did however work on thin wispy body hair I have in some places on my body & it did bleach those hairs. The only answer for us women with the coarse hair is to remove it, bleaching just doesn't work for that type of hair & I tried the Saally Hansen & the Jolen bleaching cream to no avail."

183964,2,I ordered the sun-screen lotion (same size tube) but the one that can be hung on a bag. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED after paying $100 for postage to receive the plain tube
32771,0,"Well, I would say that I should use them everyday but I haven't gotten into a routine yet. I think the more you use them the better they would work because it did seem to soften my ""scowl"" lines and they aren't uncomfortable at all! Just put it on before bed and at first it seems like it isn't going to stay but it did every time and came off easily with water in the morning. My only problem is I like to wear moisturiser at night and your skin has to be clean and dry. So I started putting my products on after-around the patch area! It's no miracle but it does help a little and that goes a long way! :-)"
167574,0,"I liked this product for about a year, then it started to get frizzy, now it's worse. I 've only had this for about a year and a half and it's already dead!!! Not so great. I wouldn't reccomend it."
230745,0,"I have been shaving my head for eight years now, 5 years and 10 months of them using a headblade. I recently completed an interstate move and lost my headblade...so for the last few months I have been using my trusty gillette mach 3 to shave my head ""old school"" style. I have to tell you, hands down- the gillette razor does a better job and leaves me with less nicks than the headblade ever did.The headblade is convenient, I will give it that. It does a ""good"" job, but not one that is stellar. It fits easily in your hand and has a very shallow learning curve on its usage. However, like another reviewer stated, it only accomplishes shaving in one direction, with a ""taditional"" razor- you get the added advantage of maneiverability. That makes all the difference.I cannot call the headblade a bad product by any means, heck I used one for years...but it just cannot compare to using a traditional method to just ""bic-it."" While the razor itself may not be the be-all end-all of the dome clearing world, the shaving creams, lotions, and scrubs that headblade produces are top notch all the way. So...my advice, is to fire up the razor you already have, but swap out the shaving cream with some headslick...follow that up with some headlube (a great moisturizing lotion) and you are good to go."
9237,2,"I purchased this set a year ago from a retail store. Unfortunately, these rollers are a real disappointment. As other reviewers have said, the clips are awful. They don't hold the roller tight enough to get a good set--but they also leave you with a nasty crease that's virtually impossible to disguise. I did try these rollers with other clips (both jaw clips and traditional wire clips), but they don't really fit right. Overall, I do not recommend this roller set to anyone."
243561,0,"I am not as crazy about this particular sponge as I am about the Buf-Puf individual sponges, but it gets the job done. I just find that I get more use out of the individual sponges than I do with this one. It just doesn't seem sanitary to use after a few uses and I end up throwing it away sooner than I am suppposed to. I feel I get more for the money with the individual sponges."
67149,0,"I have thin hair...I need some boost and this did nothing but mentally satisfy me. If you're going bald like me...you're going bald. No getting around it. I do use the American Crew Boost Cream and that however does a decent job. Boost cream YES, Thickening Shampoo NO."
15922,0,"This is a great product increasingly hard to find. But BEWARE ordering it from AmericaRx! They charge $2.99 per can + $4.40 s/h PER CAN. That's right, the price is $7.39 per can, even if you order more than one (actually, they gave me a ""shipping promotion"" knocking off about a third of the s/h price, but that still comes out to around $6/can)! See other buyer complaints about AmericaRx pulling these shipping-charges stunts. They package them together, but charge separately.There are other sellers of the same product who don't sneak your money this way. Find another seller besides AmericaRx."

116933,0,"I did not understand why all the people went insane about this blush. It's only beautiful on fair skin. I am somewhat medium tan (Barcelona in Nars Sheer Glow), and this blush works mainly as a highlight than anything else, because of the shimmer. I honestly don't mind the golden shimmer, it's beautiful but it's the low pigmentation that seems to appear just chalky on my skin tone. All Nars blushes are known for their high pigmentation, but this 'Orgasm' and 'Sex Appeal' don't really have much of a payoff on medium tanned skin tones. I like to pay big buck for a product when I know it will be noticeable, and these shades are not.Instead 'Deep Throat' and 'Torrid' are fantastic alternatives. They're similar coral, peachy slight pinks, with beautiful gold shimmer running through them. I wear Torrid on a regular basis, it's a my 'go to blush'.The longevity of all Nars blushes is fantastic. They last through out the day. I have a naturally oily skin, so I am usually concerned about products slipping off my face. But when I wear Nars blushes, I am confident that I don't have to worry about re-applying through out the day. I'd rather spend the money on a quality product than bunch of bucks on several drug store products that I quickly get sick of, because of their poor quality."
27335,1,"Zadro Ultimate Make-up MirrorI love this mirror. It's very useful having both normal and magnified views, one above the other so that you can move between them easily, without having to manipulate the mirror. I didn't think I'd use the magnified part but actually I now use it more than the normal mirror. The lighting is excellent -- mimics natural light well. I really like being able to close the mirror and have it fold really flat -- not just good for traveling but for when you don't want a multiple mirrors staring other people in the face or you just want it out of the way."
175633,0,"Fair warning- if you're easily TMI-ed (""too much information"") you may want to stop right here.As far as ""feminine hygiene"" products go, this type has pros and cons. I purchased the Diva Cup, which is basically identical to the Keeper. This product, like the Diva Cup, is relatively easy to clean, is much more eco-friendly than disposable products, and provides decent, if not perfect, protection against leaks. (I have heavy periods and don't get ""perfect"" protection from overnight pads worn for more than a few hours though... so I expect most women would find the Keeper more than sufficient in that area.) I would have continued to use this as one of my main products if not for one significant problem.It gets stuck.Yes, this happened more than once, and happened to the extent that I was not able to remove it on my own... one time my boyfriend was able to get it out (VERY awkward!) and the other time I had to go to the doctor to have it removed. Maybe it's just the way I'm built, but this thing traveled right up to my cervix while I was wearing it, and must have tried to keep going or something. And that little protrusion at the bottom is not as helpful as it looks. Trying to reach way up inside yourself and grab a tiny something you can't see is more likely than not going to lead you to accidentally pinch yourself in a tender area. (VERY uncomfortable!) Probably more than once.I'm all for being green, and if you can afford to try it's worth trying- everyone's built differently and I understand some women swear by the Keeper and have never had the problems I did. But for some women, like myself, the sea sponge-based methods are just as environmentally friendly, and considerably more comfortable and easier to remove. (I cannot overstress the easier to remove part enough.) True, you may need to replace the sponges once or twice a year (less if you use them infrequently) but you don't get much more biodegradable than a sea sponge."

208975,2,"I have used Bare Escentuals makeup for years. I love most of the line, but not this one item. First, when you apply it, it makes your lips tingle. And it has made my lips unusually sensitive once it has been removed. Then there is the stickiness. I have long hair and the the Buxom Lips lip gloss was like a magnet for my hair. I just couldn't keep it from my lips whenever my hair fell forward. Yuck! It felt goopy and sticky. I like lip glosses, but just not this one. Too sticky for me...."

120364,1,"This is the best foundation I have ever tried. I have a tendency to get red skin, which Youngblood eliminates completely without looking unnatural. The first time I applied it I thought it made my pores show, but I realised it was just a matter of working it into the skin correctly with the right Youngblood brush. Doing so, my skin appears flawless. Highly recommended!"
67280,1,I have loved this perfume for years. it has a unique smell. not sweet. it stays for a long time :) you will love it too.
124201,0,"I've used this for several months and have mixed feeling about this product. First, you have to get past the weirdness of washing with black soap. It rinses off, but it's unusual to have smokey gray colored lather. The abrasive elements, designed for deep cleaning, are not the pumice-like, gritty, or sandy particles in other exfoliating soaps. These are big. The size of aquarium gravel. Because of this you really feel the abrasiveness. Personally I would prefer smaller abrasive particles as I think they abrade more evenly. It has a nice minty scent that is not overpowering. The product leaves a light waxy coating on the skin. I assume this is supposed to have some benefits or moisturize the skin. I'm not saying this as a negative, but it's not like any other soap I have used. It's not clear to me why a soap that is supposed to exfoliate and clear the pores, would then be designed to apply a coating to the skin. This seems to defeat the purpose. My big gripe is that it is brittle. I use this in the shower, and if I drop the bar, pieces of it shatter off, every time. Small pieces, enough to shorten the life of the soap, but too small to use. Because of this, the bar does not last as long as it probably could.I have mixed feelings about this soap. I like it in some ways. It smells great and does seem to clean. However I feel there are other products out there that are better and cost less. As such, the best I can muster is a 3 star review. Not a great product, but not a bad one either."
187349,1,"I ordered these eyeliner pencils on 1/16/12 and they were in my mailbox on 1/19/12. Beauty Encounters provided the best service EVER, and sent exactly the item I'd ordered. I've been using these pencils for years -- the old-fashioned hand-sharpen Prestige with the dark stick (NOT the silver stick) and they can't be beat. I've tried much more expensive pencils, but only this particular one is just the right texture between soft and hard. It's true that you do have to clear off some which has migrated to the area beneath your lower lid during the middle of the day, but other than that, these pencils work beautifully. In the evening, you may need to refresh the line, but this gives a pencil line that lasts for the entire workday."
62750,2,"I am not impressed with this product for several reasons. Number one: it's advertised as an all-day wear, which it is not. Number two: its also advertised as suitable for working out- it wont clog your pores, etc, it is no better than a drugstore brand on this front or the all-day wear. And lastly, finding a tone that matches your own is nearly impossible as it only comes in three shades. Keep your money."
251914,0,I purchased this spray trying it once in Macy store and read the review on this site as well. I liked the fragrance. The bottle I received did well for first few days and after that it was loosing its fragrance. It does not last more than hour or two.

Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I'm sure the &#34;no poo&#34; aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache. I have scent sensitivities, especially with flowery scents, so the amount of fragrance in the product would have been helpful to know in advance. I would have chosen a different product."
14840,2,I ordered this based off of the color displayed in the photo!!When I recieved the product I found that it was PLATINUM BLONDE! Not at all what I wanted!

137797,0,"I received this lotion as a gift, and was excited about it because I love the scent of chai tea. But the actual lotion has a very strong, very perfume-y scent that doesn't bear a strong resemblance to chai. It was so strong and sweet it actually made me feel kind of ill. The texture of the lotion was fine, but I ended up not being able to wear it due to the scent."
106407,2,"I was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews, but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so I gave it a try. I love it! It's surprising. It changes. On me, when I first put it on it takes on a white floral scent. When I first applied it, I was surprised that it seemed like a floral"".. but hours later I was smelling Vanilla. I was very surprised to realize it was me! VERY interesting! Very cool! Lighter than the Original Poison, it may become my Spring/Summer choice!"

218376,2,"Although I have a nice tingly feeling after using this and it and although it also leaves my hair feeling cool and smelling minty, I would have to stay that it makes my hair greasy and does not repair chemically processed damaged hair right away. I was told it takes six months for Wen to repair damaged hair and for some people it works right away and makes their hair feel heavy...but not mine!!! I would like to see ""new hairs growing in new areas where it stopped."" But I guess it takes more time to see results than I would have liked or expected. I have to use an organic soap with shampoo in order to make my hair feel clean because this product makes my hair greasy and look sinfully dirty, as though I haven't bathed in weeks. Yuck! I would have expected better results for such a high price. Chaz Dean, you have disappointed me for the umpteenth time. How come this product (Lavender) makes my friend's hair feel ""silky, soft, shiny and smooth"" but not mine? Can you please make the product bigger at least and make it longer-lasting? I would give it two stars or maybe even three if this product lasted longer and did not run out right away. Awfully pricey.... I am going back to use my Trader Joes shampoo and conditioner. I will also buy Russian shampoo which is a MUCH lower price in Russia once I visit my native Moscow. I WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS BUT I DO NOOOOOT HAVE THAT OPTION."

144890,1,"I purchased this diffuser when I had broken the one that came with my hair dryer. I love the size of the bowl and the amount of air that is circulated, it makes my hair curlier than it ever has been before. The diffuser comes with a few different attachments to fit different sized dryers. I have to kind of wiggle the nozzle on my dryer into a smaller attachment, but it fits nice and tight with no fear of it coming off. If you have a very large nosed dryer it will probably not work with this diffuser."

213608,1,"Vetiver Guerlain is by no means the oldest fragrance made by Guerlain but it is one of the most popular. It is a complex yet clean and balanced blend of citrus, grassy, and peppery notes with just a touch of tobacco. It is not in the least bit musky. As with all scents, it is not right for everyone, but more men will like this than not and women find it very appealing.In fact, many women wear Vetiver Guerlain as well, despite it being a men's fragrance. I began wearing it after ""borrowing"" some from a boyfriend. No, it wouldn't be the best choice for an evening at the opera but it's a nice all-around scent that makes me think of a picnic on a lawn.If you are a woman, and like this scent, but think it is too masculine, try it with just a bit of lavender scent to add a complementary floral tone."
76392,2,"When purchasing your item I was not made aware that it was not under the Australian standards I do not have an American power point in my home no one does here in Austraia, so this product is useless to me and I have no return address to send it back to.

I love this color for deigns on my nail, but it's not my favorite overall nail color for a better alternative orange from China Glaze I would recommend Papaya Punch for China Glaze's 2011 Island Escape collection."
218421,0,"I have been using Wen for a few months now. After I figured out how much to use, I didn't experience the greasiness that others have, but I also didn't experience the amazing hair like you see on TV. I tried mango/coconut (good), fig (didn't like the smell), pomegranate (didn't like the smell), tea tree (good, but drying as a leave-in), and almond-mint (good all-around). I did find that if I used a lot, then I got better results. However, I went through more than one bottle a month and while my hair does look and feel better, it isn't amazing enough to make the $35+ a month worth it. If I could get away with using only the conditioner, then I could rationalize the expense. But, I still need a de-frizzing leave-in daily and heavy conditioning every once in a while which means I'm buying nearly as many hair products as before Wen. As another unfortunate side effect, the smells didn't always mix so sometimes my hair literally smelled like garbage.I will continue to use Wen - I do think it's a good product - but, I'm using it as a leave-in conditioner with some other, cheaper sulfate-free shampoos."
113009,2,"This dryer is a fake! I have the original dryer and I know what the real feels and looks like, including the serial number and the packaging. This dryer was wrapped in a black plastic bag (looked like a garbage bag) and the serial number didn't match at all. Is sounded funny and loud. Please be cautious and don't buy this dryer on Amazon. I returned mine and got my money back. I went directly to the T3 website and got the AUTHENTIC T3 hair dryer. Thank you."
2369,2,"Fogless for a few days. Now constantly needs to be cleaned with 409 and rinsed off. So far not any better than a cheap sun visor mirror that can be bought at any grocery store for less than $5.00.Also, when I called customer service to inquire about a remedy, the woman who answered the phone started to pull out the proverbial hoops through which she would drag me.I gave it one star because it is bigger than a sun-visor mirror and it does stick to the glass shower enclosure fairly well, at least so far.Unless my foggy purchase is remedied, I must say ""pass on this and all their products."""
141720,0,"This was my first try at organic conditioners and it works but you do need to use a little more of it in order to get the job done. i started using a leave in detangle spray so that helps. also, organics should help the environment, plastic containers (especially when theres so many alternatives) work against that. so 3 stars, -1 for having to use more, -1 for the plastic."
232800,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
7705,0,Eternity is a rather weak perfume. It's barely perceptible after application and its effects wear out in a few hours. It is not suitable for a full day use - especially if you have long working hours and a high-stress work enviroment. I am going back to Chrome Azzaro
49783,1,"I'm a natural redhead (or was!) & for me this is the best color I've found. My sister is a hair colorist in Georgia and told me this is the only ""over the counter"" color that's got any decent color. The tone on tone colors are actually noticeable and you don't have to be a genius to get it right, just mix it.Note: Once I've done my roots, I add water & conditioner (Dove, cheap & good) to the dye before I pull the color through the rest of my hair. The lower I get, the more I add to the dye (I've got long hair & one bottle is enough). Helps keep from overprocessing the older hair and damaging it too much. Biggest diff. w/over the counter is the amount of ammonia...more damagins."
12375,0,"I am a huge fan of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free Face Wash, so when I had hard time finding my stand-by scrub, naturally I grabbed this. Having had irritation problems with other scrubs, I was cautious to only use this on my forehead prior to using it on the rest of my skin. After using this on my forehead my skin was smoother, but when I moved to my chin a few days later my chin broke out slightly. Although my skin (especially in the chin area) is slightly sensitive-I haven't had friction induced acne in years!This is a white cream with micro-beads in the formula. The package claims these beads are Beta Hydroxy, but after reading the ingredients I cannot figure out what they are. This has a nice fresh scent-citrus but not girly. This has salicylic acid in it-so it does have an acne fighting component.I will continue to use this product and hope my skin can build up tolerance to it, because the areas on my face that did not break out look very nice and are smoother.Skin type: oily, few lines, 20-something, slightly pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne proneIngredients I got off the package: water, sodium methyl cocyl taurate, polyethylene, glycerin, cocomidopropyl, betaine, glycol distearate, stearic acid, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acylate crosspolymer, linoleanidopropyl, PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, neopentyl glycol dicoprlate/dicoporate, salicylcic acid, disodium edta, xanthan gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, sodium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, mathylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, putylparaben, agar, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, red 20 lake, fragrance."

38582,1,I have been using this particular NARS product for a number of years. It is easy to apply and the color is great for my skin tone.

148661,0,"I love the fragrance of Cabochard, so I wanted the lotion to go with the fragrance. The fragrance of the lotion is true, but the lotion itself is disappointingly thin. Actually, I'd expected a cream rather than a lotion, but the texture is so thin that it doesn't even have to be squeezed to come out. Wish it were thicker."

My problem is around the bikini area and I'm almost resigned to giving up on maintaining my bikini wax (though I don't really wax...I use an epillator). The other reviews were what really got me to buy this product---the ones which mentioned that the results were amazing, not to mention almost instantaneous. Do send me an idea of how to apply the Princereigns correctly so that the whole bottle doesn't just go to waste. I use it twice a day after I shower. thanks."

76851,0,"I have this in the ALL NIGHT LONG shade. It is a nice shade: plummy/wine semi-sheer. It goes on nice, but barely lasts fifteen minutes. My biggest gripe aside from the price is that this gloss had a nasty smell and taste. Like burnt plastic. Just YUCK!"
197283,2,i got this because of all the reviews and its sooooooo cheap! it should be a $9.99 flat iron. didnt heat up and the light was just blinking. the people who gave this thing a good score has either have no hair have staraight hair or be on drugs. dont buy it $60 for a cheap product $20 more and you can get a WAYYYY better flat iron. the first day it was shipped to me i shipped it right back didnt have it even 24 hrs

117266,0,Its a nice product and you get a lot of it in the bottle (goes a long way).I mix it with sugar for an exfoliating scrub.I give it 3 stars since I wanted to use it to help with my KP on my arms and lower back and part of my butt and while the exfoliation helps with smoothness it doesnt really help with the appearance of red dots. It's weird since in a shower they will be less noticeable and you think you found something that works but right when you dry off your skin goes back (this is even after months of continuos use so its not for me not using it for awhile as some might try to argue)
63203,0,Item arrived quickly. Product is OK. Have not noticed any changes. Do not like the pump dispenser. One never gets all the product out. Seems wasteful.
49947,2,"I admit, I got sucked in watching QVC and with the idea of getting something special from the rain forest, but honestly, if you read the ingredients there is nothing special about this product. I now use a 2 dollar essential oil mix (peanut, castor, olive, almond, wheat germ, and sesame seed oils, as well as vitamin E) as a pre shampoo treatment and it works better than this. (Can be found at Sally's, walgreens, and even walmart) If Ojon works for you that's great, but this product really is an overpriced hot oil treatment."
246953,2,"I compared this product with others that should be equal and I can see that the button to spray is totally different, one is rubber with the name in embossed while this is a rigid plastic button that makes it difficult to spray. Assessing another aspect, the smell does not last as long as it does the other with which I made the comparison and have a difference in the aroma. I have purchased many products through Amazon and have always preferred in which they are sellers, but this time I have my doubts about the quality of this product."
54015,2,"The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl. However, curl does not keep. Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn't keep curler in place. Seller was great but product not so hot."

109608,0,"I knew it was going to be sweet but this is almost borderline a women's fragrance. Smells like a vanilla talcum powder, almost. Not very masculine, but it doesn't smell horrible."
151900,2,"I normally use Manic Panic Rock N Roll Red or Pillarbox Red, but Sally's was closed and I needed to spruce myself up before an event the next day. So I headed over to Ulta to see what I could find. I am a huge fan of Manic Panic as it is a natural, vegan, non-damaging product and I figured Jerome Russell's Punky Color was equivalent... Not so much. The bottom inch or two of my hair has been breaking off ever since. To be fair, the color is nice and the product smells great--It does stain the hands a lot more than MP, but lasts longer in the hair. I'm not sure what the difference is in the formula, but I will definitely be going back to Manic Panic because after using MP my hair actually feels softer and more conditioned than before using it. I highly recommend Manic Panic over Jerome Russell's Punky Color."
190689,0,"The bristle most certainly do not fall out, the brush is good construction, but the bristles are very stiff. Too stiff for me, I have short hair and a short beard, the bottom line is it is just too stiff. It is rough on the skin and after a few minutes of brushing it starts to feel like you're dragging nails across your skin. I bought a replacement and it was too soft, so I guess it is just a matter of finding one that works for you. Beware, when they say reinforced stiff bristle, they really mean it."
139893,0,"I've read complaints from other reviewers about the mat not sticking to the bottom of the tub. When I first got the bubble mat, I had a fiberglass tub and the mat never ever stuck to the bottom of the tub. It was frustrating and not very relaxing to try to lay in the tub and try to keep the bubble mat from floating to the surface. But when I moved to a new place with a ceramic glazed tub, the suction cups actually held very tightly. What a difference in experience! The air pressure is strong enough to generate lots of bubbles and I always feel massaged and more relaxed afterwards. However, I can only give this 3 stars because the thing is so damn noisy! In a small bathroom, the sound just echos. It's sometimes nice when you want to block out other outside sounds that you want to escape, but when I want a nice quiet bath, I leave out the bubble mat."
121052,2,"After reading the rave reviews on this spray, I decided to give it a try. However, when I got the product and smelled it...I was disappointed right away. It smells nothing like the description and is VERY overpowering. I thought maybe I just had to warm up to it, so I sprayed it on each wrist and tried to keep it on all day. I lasted for a few hours and just could not take it anymore... at this point it gave me a horrible headache and when my boyfriend came home he asked what the ""weird smell"" was and looked disgusted... I had to take a shower to scrub it off for both of our sake! Bottom line: was very disappointed, will not order again, and will not recommend this to my friends."
13283,0,"The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife. Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning. I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value."
157637,0,"This has always been in the back of my mind since a review from Eki at ekimura.com quite a long time ago, and my interest was renewed after seeing a version in Sephora. I would say this adds upwards curl, and I think is best used as an evening refresher. In the morning I find that if I do not let my (fiber) mascara completely dry, this curler will melt the mascara off. In the evening this is a good way to refresh your curl without gunking up your regular eyelash curlers. Finally - despite the fact that I have not experienced any issues yet, I am slightly wary of using this while wearing contacts. Overall I think it's something you'll have to experiment with to see if it works for you, and it is a bit overhyped in Youtube and Blogger reviews. The sparkly blue cap is a nice touch. (:"
93095,1,This product is the perfect thing for post-maternity bellies. It smells fabulous and it's a nice treat at the end of a long day. I highly recommend this product!
47425,1,"I love the smell of Cranberry, not to mention that it is an antioxidant so you get the best of everything in this product. But, I usually buy Bath and Body Holiday Cranberry, but since the Holidays are long gone the price has sky rocketed so I bought this instead and low and behold I got the same smell for less. I promise you when you use this product with the lotion and the spray OMG everyone you pass or you are around will ask who and what smells so good."

224613,1,"I have really thick wavy hair and this thing straigtens it when it's completely wet! It works well dry too. It even stays straight when its humid or rainy out! And this actually might be better for your hair, as drying and straigening at the same time exposes your hair to less heat than using a hair dryer and then a straightener. My hair seems healthy and shiny after using it.One thing to note is that you can't use this straightener as a culing iron like other 1"" straighteners.Altogether I love it!"
39802,1,"I definitely would not have bought this cologne if I had tried it first. I thought it came on too strong and the scent wasn't as pleasing or subtle as I would have liked it to. I can only describe it as a bitter-spicy first impression which rapidly gives away to a sophisticated, spicy/sweet kind of ""powderish"" after-smell. This change in mood is the reason why I won't get rid of Brit by Burberry - it truly becomes a pleasing, all day fragrance."

66613,2,"i sent it back after trying it out once. i found it to be of poor quality (especially since it is so expensive). hair gets caught under the plates (edges) and rips/snags the hair. it makes noise as the plates touch. plus, damp hair sizzles, so not any different than a regular flat iron. i just purchased a solia flat iron which i found to be much better, and cheaper."
192014,1,"This is a wonderful product that can be used for a toner.It doesn't contain or require the use of ammonia or peroxide.It leaves lovely shine and body to the hair.It gives you the option of being a wash out color, temporary enough to be removed with next shampoo or semi-permanent, which will last through eight washes.For semi-permanent you keep it on with a cap and heat up to thirty minutes.It helps eliminate yellow and red tones from bleached hair.This particular color is subtle and gives a sheer pale brown tint.Very satisfied with the results,"
133586,0,"I bought a 6 month supply, 3 months in so far, no results to speak of. Its possible it will take longer, and its possible there will be no results at all but its been more than the 2 months expected so I'm giving it a 3 because to be fair they didn't ""promise"" you any results at all."
246451,1,"I have used this product for years. Switched to fancy dept. store brands and ended up comng back.What I like:1. Easy application. Single coat of the white base, let fully dry for about 30 secs, then one top coat of color. Gives perfect thickness and length for the entire day. No smudges or flaking EVER.2. Comes off easily at end of day(using eye makeup remover)with no pulling at my lashes!2. Great price for a quality daytime or nighttime mascara.3. Lasts forever. I make myself buy a new one about every 6 months for fear of bacterial growth in the tube. If not for that, it would last a lot longer. There's plenty of product in the tube if you want double or more coats, but not so much that it clumps."
180917,2,"I was disappointed after trying this product, based on the glowing reviews. I needed to keep a formal dress in place, but the tape did not work for me. Perhaps it had to do with the inner lining of the dress. It was a BCBG dress, very constructed bodice, with an inner lining made of an almost mesh fabric. The tape did not stick at all. Perhaps I can use it in the future to try with a garment that has a more fluid fabric. It was a mess with the dress. Sorry that I cannot recommend, but I think it may not work in all cases."
17023,0,"I really liked the color of this one. It's very close to my natural color. For those who have resistant gray or quite a bit of gray, I wouldn't recommend it though. I have about 15 percent and it didn't seem to cover very well. It also seemed to dry my hair out a bit. I really prefer permanent color, but for those wanting a """"lift"""" or a slight change it may work out well."
96711,1,"This product was purchased on Amazon since I had difficulty finding it at two of my local large drug stores. Amazon has everything! The eye patch is reasonably well made, was manufactured in China and certainly works fine for its intended purpose, protecting my eye after it is medicated and while it recovers from ""dry eye syndrome.""The first eye patch sent apparently was mislaid by USPS, so there was a delay in receiving the product. Upon notifying the seller, and expressing my urgent medical need for the product, they quickly shipped me a replacement, not only at no charge, but also credited my account for the original purchase price to compensate me for the delay.This speaks well for the seller."

110349,0,"I had been looking for a musk oil roll-on and came across this. After reading the reviews of the scent and the seller, I decided to try this. High praise for the seller, however I am somewhat disappointed in the scent. The first two times I rolled this on, the smell reminded me of baby powder AND after rolling it on both wrists, behind ears and on neck, the scent was GONE from my wrists. Unfortunately this scent barely lasts two minutes on me. On the positive side, the baby powder smell went away and the scent of the Egyptian Goddess came through, which I like, and is a lovely summer days scent. I was so hoping this would last for a while on my skin. In the future I will try other roll-on oils and most certainly the seller. However, for now, I will go back to Kiehl's, and buy their original musk oil which lasts at least 1/2 a day on my body. I will keep the E.Goddess and ue it as aromatherapy."
133978,1,"We've bought Manic Panic for several years now. This color is my teenagers' absolute favorite. Just my two cents but the ideal use for this product is to first bleach the hair with Manic Panic bleach, the drugstore stuff doesn't go light enough and it washes out so be prepared to reapply it frequently. My teen touches hers up about every week. If you are looking for intense color without bleach - don't buy this you won't be happy."
154870,2,"I have used a similar item for years until the heating element broke in it. I bought this one to replace it and was horribly dissappointed. The air flow is so weak that you HAVE to use another dryer to dry your hair before you can use this to curl your ends. The barrel loses its grip with the slightest resistance, which means that every time you hit a tangle the barrel rolls and straightens your hair instead of curling it and you have to take the dryer and push the barrel back on it. And then it broke after only 3 weeks of use. What a waste of money! I will keep looking for the old model that I used."
137452,1,"Color is bright, especially in the light! Just a little thin, takes a lot of coats 3-4 and doesn't last as long as other colors. Maybe it's the neon? But all in all I love it."
136665,0,"I am very perplexed about this product. I originally ordered the smaller shampoo and conditioner. My hair typically grows 1/4 inch a month. After 4 weeks of using both the shampoo and conditioner my hair grew a full inch. I was stunned and quite happy. So, I then ordered the larger size shampoo and conditioner. It smelled different and it is not working at all. After 4 more weeks, not even a 1/4 inch of new growth. Is it possible they do not consistently use the same ingredients? Not sure what to think now."

9942,0,"I've only tried this once so I the verdict is still out, but honestly I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. Caveat: my hair is super super dry and damaged and I am in the process of repair (hence buying this product). However, the bottle was teeny tine (1.7 fluid ounces idk why I expected it to be bigger) and the spray pump did not work. The product is a relatively thick (like a lotion) so I'm not sure why there is a spray to begin with-- the straw feeding into the bottle also only goes to the neck so I was just really confused and annoyed by the damn thing. I also did not use it to blowdry my hair (which is the only use listed on the bottle) because I airdryed. I applied to my damp hair, then moisturized and sealed when dry and flat ironed."
207874,2,"I was really thinking that Halston Z-14 was a steal at the price. The delivery of the item was fine but the smell of the product just isn't what I expected. I used it once and then immediately ordered some Calvin Klein Free which has a lot less cloying fragrance. Now I have a practically full bottle of Z-14 that I won't use. I also noticed, after my purchase, that you can buy the Z-14 at WalMart for a low price. I can't recommend the Z-14 fragrance. It's not my cup of tea. It appears that you do get what you pay for."
34443,2,Eep. I should have listened to my friends and not used this on bleached hair. It fades quickly and it fades to a sickly grey color on bleached hair in just a couple of weeks. On dark hair it simply fades to nothing in a few washes. Have had much better results with another brand.
218323,2,"So, like most people who complain about their hair not looking as glamorous and as healthy as they would like it to be , I thought I would find my answer in the Wen hair care products. Being of a mixed race, my hair is fine, but coarse. When I saw the conditioning hair treatment used on ethnic hair and how gorgeous they both turned out (one woman in particular had hair like mine -- very curly and dry after shampooing; her hair came out shiny and curls bounced back into place), not to mention how the product boasts of natural oils and botanicals, I figured, ""Why not? What have I got to lose? If her hair could turn out like that, maybe I have a chance."" My hair is not in bad shape, but I would love to see a little more shine. Boy, was I wrong!I followed the directions to the letter: Rinsed hair for two minutes, administered 15 pumps each on the crown, nape and sides of hair; massaged vigorously for a few moments, took a wide-toothed comb to evenly coat the hair (this is where the trouble started); put a shower cap on and continued my shower. When I combed my hair with this product in it, it came out more than when I used a regular shampoo and conditioner. I discounted it to probably being old hair that was shedding. Once I rinsed it out thoroughly, I didn't see too much hair. I wrapped my hair in a towel for five minutes to remove the excess water and continued my after-shower routine.When it was time for me to comb out my hair again (using a wide-toothed comb), my hair was dry, frizzy and brittle. Giving the product the benefit of the doubt, I put a little more water on my hair before using the 1-3 pumps as recommended for the leave-in conditioner, combed it back into a ponytail, twisted it, wrapped a scarf on it (to prevent flyaway hair), and let it air dry. By the time I was ready to comb it later in the day, not only was my hair much drier and dehydrated, I wasn't able to get the comb through it! Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I jumped back in the shower and used my regular shampoo to wash out the Wen product.I'm glad I only bought a 6 oz. bottle from Amazon, instead of going to the web site directly to order it. I will not be using this product again. I'll go back to using my regular hair care regimen of shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and oils. Sorry, but I can't recommend this product."
203810,2,"I normally use the Lavender Wen and just felt like a change so I ordered the Fig, thought it would be the same quality but definitely NOT. The Fig Wen left my hair feeling very dry and brittle and it smelled horrible, like something burnt. I was so surprised because I really love the Lavender version and my hair has never looked better."
35475,0,I heard that you can get something similar to this for a lot cheaper. Someone tell me where because I don't know if it was worth the money!
87910,1,Im extremely happy with the product it was more than what was. Expected perfectly.i will do bussiness with again and again
197663,2,This item is fake. Anyone who has owned a Chi before will immediately realize that this item does not work like an authentic Chi flat iron. I bought this Chi to replace my old one and this one is like spray painted cheap plates on the flat iron that snags your hair and does not straigthen well. I might as well have just bought a $9 flat iron from the drug store. Save yourself some time and energy and do not buy this falt iron from this retailer
189245,0,"I used this for a year and it did nothing for my skin. After using it your face is smooth, but you get that from any type of product like this. Look into Dr. Brandt or Philosophy products over this."
181487,0,"The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though."
34013,0,"The color of the bottle was cobalt, the same as years ago. But the bottle was very ""now."" The fragrance was VERY strong - not what I remembered.All in all, okay.Amazon is very good however. Came in a very timely manner."
50198,2,"The mirror arrived broken and there was no option for returning or exchanging it (other than paying $4.95 for postage -- hardly worth it), so the brand new mirror, shipping box and all went straight to the trash. Don't waste your money!"
45501,2,this was not as I remembered it smelling like. I used to have this same cologne back in the day and the memories were good which is why I bought this one. Bad idea! I dont know if it was just me or this is now where near the original. since it was so long ago I can't really tell. All I know is this version stinks. Thank god it was only $10. It will be a gift for someone I don't like very much. lol...
18403,2,"I bought this lip gloss looking for something that would last as long as a lip stain. The application isn't that bad (twist and wait), and the taste isn't bad, but as soon as I put it on, it's gone 30 minutes later. I put it on and it's goopy and sticky because it's a gloss, but after I wait for it to set, it still comes off within 30 minutes. And I'm not obsessively licking or chewing my lips or anything! Honestly, both cheap lipstick and lipstain from the drugstore last 10 times as long as this (and are MUCH cheaper.) Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't last and I find it ridiculously expensive."
92420,0,"Note that amazon.com title for the product isTea Rose Perfume By Perfumers Workshop 4.0 oz.This is not perfume, it is Eau De Toilette."
181830,0,"The color is amazing, but the polish is very thin. Every brushstroke leaves visible imperfections. It's very hard to get an even coat due to it's watery-consistency. I would expect this from a cheap wal-mart brand of polish, not this. Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied."
225184,1,I have been searching for a pure rose scent. This one fits the bill. Perfect and long lasting.
36549,1,"Please stop complaining about the color of the product as it displays on your computer screen compared to the actual color of the product! Anyone who has ever bought an item online knows the little disclaimer that colors depicted online are not always true to the actual color.In this case, the written description of the color along with the image were helpful in choosing this item. I was happy with the ""Riley"" color, and the quality was satisfactory, too. My ""wear time"" before chipping was about five days, as other reviewers already noted."
37309,2,after seeing all of the 5 star ratings i had really high hopes for this product. it just didn't work for me. there was no color change in my skin at all.
143365,0,"good design, feels good in the hand. but about the third time i turned it on it made a popping noise, there was a little flash, the display went out, and it wouldn't turn off. i returned it, but i wish it had worked."
68135,0,I like all the Burberry perfumes but this one. I just couldn't wear it..to strong for me. It's still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I'll keep it there. I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle. Beware of those magazine samples...that's happened to me before.
201396,0,"The brush is almost impossible to find in the marketplace so I was delighted to find this. However, paying almost $9.00 in shipping and handling for 3 such small and lightweight items seemed like gouging to me. I will not buy from Cache Beauty Supply again."
188337,2,"The first time I bought this product, I liked it. It tingled, plumped up my lips a bit and it was fun.Every time since that I've bought it(I won't tell you how many times!), it has been a huge failure. Like putting vaseline on my lips. Greasy and gross.So, personally, I think you have to get lucky with this product. Or maybe my lips got immune to it somehow. Regardless, for me, it's not worth the gamble. I recommend you spend the money only if you are prepared to throw it away.Ta ta lip venom."
86293,0,"Despite the nasty tasting product, my 8 yo dd still sucks her thumb. I don't think it's the product's fault, as much as it is my dd's stubborn determination to suck her thumb. If this didn't work, I don't have much hope for anything else."
39368,0,"The nail polish was worth the cheap price, and worked well for a night out, but didnt last more than two days. I used it with a top coat and it looked great the first day, but started flaking off on the second."
147944,1,"My mom and sister are both covered in stretch marks so I just kind of accepted that I would get them too. I wasn't going to use anything but I figured I would regret not trying anything so I ordered this oil. I applied it every morning and night and I am stretch mark free (currently 5 months post)! I watched what I ate, gaining the recommended 30lbs which may have had something to do with it but if I get pregnant again I'll be buying this again.I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. I probably spent $200 on this stuff but like I said earlier, I would do it again."
136664,0,"This shampoo and conditioner is amazing because my hair is so much manageable after i use it. The shampoo is not hard on your hair and the conditioner makes your hair feel soo soft. I tried many conditioners but they were never as good as this one. . as for growth: i've been using this for 3 weeks and my boyfriend asked me one day ""is your hair getting longer???"" it really did look long that day. . i dont know if its from the shampoo or if its from how i styled it that day. however, my hair does seem longer so i will continue to use this product. im also taking vitamin pills. all this is really worth the money. good hair makes you feel good."
91641,0,"I ordered this product along with two other blades from this seller. I ordered a size 00000, 0000, and a T-blade for a finisher. They took a little longer than Amazon expected to send me info on the expected ship date, and when they did finally shipped it out to me, they sent me 2 00000 blades. I was a little pissed off abou it but I didn't want to deal with seller again so I just kept the wrong blade. Just beware that they make take longer than you may expect to recieve any products from them and your product may not be right. As for the way the blades work, they work great."
151298,2,"This was a complete knock off, not the real product at all. Not worth the price whatsoever. The seller completely falsely represented the product, even to the extent of putting a fraudulent picture of the real product on Amazon so buyer would not know any better."
15131,0,"I have been using this product for about 2 months now.. It works ok for the most part. I have noticed that I am not getting as many ingrown hairs as I used to and when I do get them they seem to be easier to get rid of which is always a plus! I have noticed it has cleared up some of the dark spots, but others are still visible they just seem to be a lighter shade. it's not perfect. I still get ingrown hairs and the dark spots definitely take some time to go away or fade away would be the correct phrase."
13448,1,"Nice color, Kinda a light peachish color. The order arrived very quickly. I had to put on a good 4 or 5 coats on each nail to make the color really show which is why its 4 stars not 5."
122321,0,"THIS IS A FINE EYE GLITTER. I WAS VERY SURPRISED HOW FINE THE GLITTER WAS WHEN I RECEIVED IT. YES I WILL ORDER MORE.THANK YOU,SHANELL"
128487,2,When it arrived it was empty. Had nothing in it. Product was in good condition that was about the only good thing I could say about it.
179286,2,"So I needed a good white polish after my last one was out, and I didn't want to pay $10 for a good one, so I thought China Glaze was a good alternative. It was horrible. It took 3-4 coats of polish before it looked even remotely opaque and non-streaky, and the brush was so so at best. I love China Glaze, but a lot of their nail polishes differ in quality like the houses at Hogwarts. This is one of their worst formulas, and I am incredibly disappointed.However, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was solid."
7546,1,"My grandaddy has Alzheimer's, and my grandma takes care of him. He is completely dependent upon her, and is really hard to maneuver. She's too proud to hire anyone to help, so this helps keep her from having to actually get him in and out of the tub several times a week. I also get the no rinse shampoo to go with it. She says it works well, and whenever I see him, he always smells and looks super clean!"
62335,0,"I needed a new hair brush quickly after I lost myBio Ionic I Tools Silver Classic Series Ionic Conditioning Brush Large Round. Unfortunately, the Bio Ionic didn't have Prime shipping. So I researched reviews on Amazon, and I went with the same-sized Olivia Garden brush. I was not pleased with the results. The BI brush does a great job at smoothing my frizzy, wavy hair, and it also adds a lot of volume and bounce. The OG brush did a similarly great job at smoothing my frizz, but my hair just didn't have the same volume; it looked way too flat.I think this could be a good brush, depending on the look you're going for. But I'm back to Bio Ionic."
67541,0,THIS PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE DRIED UP WHEN I RECEIVED IT.ITS HARD TO GET OUT OF THE CONTAINER TO PUT ON THE BRUSH.
153048,1,"This has taken my drying time down from 30 minutes to 15, and it leaves my hair so soft and smooth I can't believe it. I have course, curly hair and this thing just whips it into shape in no time. I was considering the T3, but was convinced at the beauty supply store that not only is this the same as a T3 for a third of the price, but this is the company that started the tourmaline technology. Anyway, bought it, love it, won't be without it! I had no idea what a difference a good blow dryer can make."
65374,0,I do like this cologne.A very suttle fragrance.It just doesnt hold up for long.....but it beats an overbearing one.
87196,1,"After the first washing, my hair felt noticably thicker and after having used this and the conditioner exclusively for 3 weeks, people are complimenting on how thick my hair looks! Huge difference from last month!"
233920,0,If it wasn't for the fact that the little knob on the switch that turns the light on and off kept falling off I would recommend this for anyone who needed this kind of magnification.
87143,2,"This conditioner does not condition my hair at all. It also smells like cheap dish soap, which leads me to believe it's not as natural as Jason products claim to be. I am getting rid of this and looking for something, anything, else."
37714,2,"I bought this product expecting it to be a new and refreshing scent that lasted (at least) through the morning/afternoon. I was, however, disappointed. Not only does this perfume smell like pure alcohol (ie. not an original scent, and in fact, no real scent at all), but, even the pure alcohol smell (thankfully..sorta) didnt last more than ten minutes. I would literally spray it on each day (hoping that maybe there would be scent that was just delayed in coming from the bottle somehow) and within five minutes, I would smell absolutely nothing (nothing good and nothing bad).Now, maybe it was just the specific vendor that I bought this product from (as I noticed several different vendors of this product on Amazon), but, this product is not worth it.There isnt even a lot of liquid in the bottle.Definitely not something to spend your hard-earned or even easy-earned money on!"
189662,2,"I have very fine shoulder length hair and yet I cannot go a full day without these breaking, especially if I lie down. Not worth the money unless they are to be used for very small bunches of hair or children's hair."
158004,2,"At a fraction of an ounce, this is pricey to say the least. In my haste, I thought I was ordering an impossible to find sample of Channel for Men and not Pour Monsieur, which is its successor. Although Channel claims the two are identical, I doubt that since I was an avid user of the original for years."
91864,0,"I have to warn everyone that this product has mineral oil and petrolatum in it. If they could replicate the results without those terrible ingredients, I'd buy it. My temples thickened up after thinning due to a temporary bout of malnutrition."
61714,1,"Yeah, I know that sounds melodramatic, but if you had perennial dry cuticles prone to cracking, splitting and hang-nails you'd understand. Also great for cracked heels. If your nails are a mess, spend a week without polish and massage this in 3-5 times a day. You'll be amazed at how rapidly, and completely, the nails an nail bed heal."
91807,1,Makes hair manageable and smells great. I use it after I towel dry and before blow drying.
47529,2,Not as good as I expected. I didn't feel like my hair was any more moisturized than when I used the conditioner I usually use. Not worth the extra money.
55720,1,It is ok it does what iit is suposed to do and help with dandruff some I guess just trying to get enough words.
146942,1,This shampoo seemed to work. My baby had cradle cap and now she doesn't so that's what we were going for! The smell wasn't too strong but wasn't as pleasant as some baby shampoos. The foam is really nice so you can spot treat and the bottle goes a long way!
185797,0,Nice nail color however chips by day 6.. Right price but overpriced for shipping. I purchased another nail color from them at the same time. I got two shipping charges when both nailpollishes come in the same $3 shipping/us postage paid envelope ! I paid $12 in shipping. What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
57568,0,"This item does smell great and does not make my hair heavy and greasy looking. It helps with frizzies, but i would say that it doesn't last very long,.. i maybe need to re-apply more often. But the price was decent."
31135,0,I would say this product is good..it is okay. Not the best. Does the coverage part but gets a bit flacky in my opinion.
13102,2,"I don't like the consistency of the product.I had a Bath & Body Works gardenia product beforethat was much richer and creamier than this butI couldn't find it any more.I wouldn't buy this product again, butI'll use it until it's gone."
111766,2,"I went through 3 of these in less than 2 months. After about 2-3 weeks of use, the first two dryers wouldn't shut off when the switch was placed in the ""off"" position; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off. The 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks. I definitely do not recommend buying this product."
184772,0,"I was so excited when I got this polish and saw how unique the blue shade was. When I used it I realized that it is not a creme polish or even a creme jelly, but a very VERY thin blue jelly. To be opaque on its own you would have to use about 4 coats. For me, it ended up being waaaay too thick and the color was just off. It does lend itself well to layering and jelly sandwiches though."
21068,1,I started using rene furterer products for almost 3 months and I can really see a difference in my hair. The complexe 5 is a must.
113918,1,"This is a great brush, not cheap looking and its great for bronzing. Handle is clear and solid. Love It"
212804,0,Great product. Received all items in perfect condition and wrapped well.Received shipment late due to backorder but was given a creditbecause of this. Would order again.
214296,0,"when i first received this product i was excited. i thought that i could get rid of some of my other hair products. to my dismay it didn't take long before i had a thick gunky buildup that made my hair appear dull and weighed down. maybe i used to much. i can't really say, but i do still use the wen cleansing conditioner every day as a leave in, so this product become expendable!"
20263,1,I purchased this as a present and It was exactly what I wanted! Its smelled good& he loved it Thank you!
179949,0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."
29519,2,"I bought this product and used it about a month ago - followed every direction perfectly. My hair seems slightly straighter, but it did absolutely nothing for the frizz. My hair seems to get knotted much easier now and my ends are dry and damaged (going to have to cut them off soon). But the worst part is that it made me lose A LOT of hair. When I was using the product, I noticed a lot of hair falling out. Now I can feel a lot of short stubble if I run my hands through my hair near my scalp. Obviously the product made lots of my hair fall out or break off. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!"
150371,0,"This shampoo has some pro's: Hair feels thicker, looks thicker, more volume.and some con's: Need to use a whole lot of it because it barely ""suds."" After rinsing it out, my hair looks and feels extremely dry and brittle (wet and dry). But, it is a thickening shampoo, and I guess if it makes my hair look thicker, it does what it says."
3575,0,"I bought this to try to remove yellow build up on my hair due to well water and copper pipes. I don't think it has really worked to remove the yellow, but the discoloring is not getting worse, so maybe the shampoo is helping. The shampoo cleans my hair nicely and has a fresh citrus smell. Overall it's a decent shampoo, but I don't think it's removing the yellow from my hair."
110338,0,"Well first off, I ordered this on (Good) Friday and received it the following Monday (today). I like the smell of it. It smells very warm and earthy. I rolled a little bit on my wrists when I first opened the package, and can still detect the scent 9 hours later, despite much hand-washing (up to my wrists), getting caught in a rainstorm, and doing the dishes. Being used to scents that are overwhelming and quick-fading, this is most impressive. Unfortunately, my husband really dislikes the smell. Like step away wrinkle his nose. He's never given much more than a shrug with any other scent I waft beneath his nose, so the instant dislike of this was serious. I tried to wash it off (hence the much hand-washing) but again, 9 hours later I can still smell it and my husband won't get close to me."
63086,0,"WELL I EXPECTED A MOARE SWEET SMELL. HOWEVER, THIS SPRAY LIVES UP TO IT'S NAME....GREY FLANNEL. WE WERE NOT WILD ABOUT THE SMELL BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT DOES LAST ALL DAY ;-)"
136078,1,"This sunblock is excellent, it won't run into your eyes when you sweat. It goes on cool and absorbs quickly. It has a very light feel on the skin."
162097,0,"This product was great for a while. The nightlight was really bright. However, about one month of using this product and it just quit."
1683,0,"While the blending of orange blossom and jasmine is luscious, this fragrance is a bit heavy for me. Perhaps I erred in buying the eau de parfum and should have purchased the eau de toilette. I've read that about three-fourths of eau de parfum is lost after several hours. That's not been my experience with Carolina Herrera. In fact, the aroma is still in the crook of my elbows until I wash it off, and it's as if I had just applied it. For many that may be a major attribute.However, my preference is for a much lighter scent - sort of a ""barely there."" While this fragrance is lovely, I wouldn't recommend wearing it to a concert or any place where you'll be in close quarters with others who may not want to enjoy your wonderful aroma.If your plans are for an evening in some secluded spot with a special someone - enjoy!"
127505,0,used once and works fine. several of the pieces do not fit properly on the clipper which causes it to rattle and be extremely loud. although after one more clip it will have already paid for itself.
80916,0,The bottle didnt look very full. If it was used prior I wouldnt be surprised. It was shipped timely which is always nice.
94643,1,I've tried different scents over the last few years trying to find a signature scent. The Emporio Armani is the singular cologne that generates the most remarks from women. I get told I smell great at least 3 or 4 times a night when I'm wearing this. I've finally found my 'signature' scent. Since its older - a lot of people don't wear it so I stand out from the crowd of men all wearing the same trendy cologne!
2569,1,I purchased this fragrance for my Grandmother for Christmas because she had been looking to try it. It was a huge bottle at an incredably low price. My grandmother loves it & now has offically added it to her list of perfumes she wears.
80634,0,"Pro: Defines Curls Con: CrunchesPro: Defrizzes Con: Sometimes dries out hair.Pro: Longlasting hold Con: Smells odd, not bad per say but just slightly off.Con: Sticky.All in all, this is a good product, as it does as it should with defining curls, yet there are definite drawbacks in texture, smell, and initial feel.To be honest, it works, but it comes nowhere near the quality of the old TIGI curls rock."
72447,2,"I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month."
133552,1,"Okay I have used this for about 2 1/2 months with good success . I had a bald spot on the crown and thinning on top all the way to the front . My hair on top was falling out fast . Clogging the drain in the shower every day . With use of this i have started growing hair on the crown and although no hair growth yet on the top it has stopped it from falling out . I have not had to clean out the drain screen in a while now .Okay the one side effect . The Kirkland brand although very affordable 24.00 for 6 months as opposed to 30.00 for one month of Rogaine does NOT dry clear in the hair like they say and like Rogaine does . It dries up clear on the scalp as it soaks in but on my light brown hair it remains sticky and a light shiny gray , kind of fuzzy looking and very noticeable . It does help to try and dry it out of my hair with a towel but kind of hard to do without drying it off the scalp .It also has stopped the falling out of hair on my beard at my chin . Still bald in a small area but no longer falling out .I may try the foam next to see how it dries up ."
63408,2,i was really excited to receive this product but it really hurt my allergies. everyone is different and some people will surely love this product. it shipped really fast and the seller was execellent but this product just wasnt for me. lucky for me the scent fades fast .
87172,0,"The product works fine. I didn't read the description that well since this is a dandruff product, and I don't have dandruff. I was just looking something without the sulfates, parabens, and dyes. The smell is a little like dog shampoo, but if you have a good conditioner, it can be masked."
155893,0,"10/01/12: Despite my initial disappointment outlined below, continued used of the product is yielding desired results. After almost a month of use my nails truly are less brittle, more supple, and not so painfully ""thin"" feeling. The splits and cracks are fewer and farther between. Still the only product of any help with the thumbnail that splits down the middle is super glue. Even so, perhaps with continued use, maybe this too will turn around. This leaves me eating crow from my critique of the initial experience, but it doesn't taste bitter considering the product benefit.Unfortunately despite continued use, my experience with the other two Barielle products remains unchanged-the nail hardener 'top coat' style product is rubbery, peels easily, and is gone after shower, the cuticle oil pools on the skin without being absorbed.-----------------------------I so wanted this product to work but after two weeks it just flat out doesn't. Not for me anyway. I purchased 3 Barielle products at the same time. This nail strengthener to reduce splits and peels, and nail hardener that goes on like a top coat that is supposed to strengthen nails and keep them from splitting as well, and an oil that is to condition the cuticle bed.From the moment it arrived I began using per directions with high hopes. Nothing. No noticeable change at all. The excess didn't even serve as a skin softener.The reason I write this now, is that I have one nail that splits down the middle and I just snagged it once again, rather painful. I have worn acrylics as a protective barrier for years because my nails are so thin, brittle, and split. I fully expected to see some sort of improvement at this point. - At least something.I'll post comments on the other two related products but the Barielle top coat style nail hardener goes on kind of rubbery, peels off very easily, and doesn't prevent splitting or cracking in my experience.Nothing. What a disappointment. Now it's back to acrylics as at least my nails won't be snagging and ripping off simply as I walk around."
178662,0,"Guys if you are looking for a great deal on a pleasant scent, and don't mind below average longevity, Just Cavalli may be for you. Just Cavalli is a blend of floral and spice that settles into a light spice and woodsy fragrance that is easy on the nose.My reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); ""wow factor"" (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Just Cavalli is as follows (scoring is out of 5 stars - 1 star is low, 3 is average, and 5 stars is best):Appeal/Uniqueness of Scent: 4Wow Factor: 3Projection: 3Longevity: 2Appropriate season/event for fragrance: 3Quality/design of bottle and packaging: 4Price/Value: 5Total Points: 24 pointsAverage Score: 3.4 points (stars)Comments: Just Cavalli is a pleasant scent that does not last. If you need an additional fragrance for the gym bag, or one you can take with you to reapply, Just Cavalli is recommended. The bottle design is unique and a conversation piece.While the above performance measures are those that are important to me, they may be less important to others. If you are shopping and have the opportunity to try a new fragrance and like it, buy it. Life is short - go for it..!! Ride the wave and don't ask where it goes...I give Just Cavalli 3.4 stars, out of 5. It is a good fragrance at a great price."
123202,2,This product is absolutely awful. It manages to migrate from the bottom lid to the area under my eyes. I look like some hit me or like a racoon because my black eyeliner has smudged and is now under the bottom lid. I only gave it a star because they wouldn't accept a zero star rating.

So... here's what I think so far:+ a good eye moisture; makes skin soft and smooth/ however, my eye stings and turns a little pink (IT COULD BE BECAUSE I APPLIED TOO MUCH!) I'll blame this one on myself+ there's no smell whatever- after three days, my eye skin area still looks the same"
112939,1,"I bought this lotion a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it!!. I'm not too thrilled about the scent, but that wears off after minutes. What I LOVE is that it keeps my skin moisturized for hours! I was using Clinique's Deep Moisture Cream/Lotion and I must say for half the price, I get a better product and my skin remains moisturized longer. I also love how my skin absorbs the lotion quickly leaving my skin soft not GREASY like other lotions/creams. I really LOVE it and I will continue to use it on my extremely dry skin!"
21704,0,"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once. It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years. Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
21243,1,"Classy package, creative design, four scents all suitable for men. I would recommend it as a good gift for someone who could use cologne but does not have very specific preference for scents~"
217360,1,"Be warned-- this stuff smells super medicinal -- sort of like original (brown) Listerine. It smells, and, more importantly *feels* like it really cleans your hair. (It smells like it disinfects it too). It rinses very clean. Big thumbs up."
65154,2,"This product is long wearing and feels good on my lips. HOWEVER the picture I used as a guide to choose the color is FAR FAR FROM ACCURATE. I don't believe that I will purchase another cosmetic product from amazon without first confirming the color elsewhere. I really like Nars products and there is nowhere near me to purchase them in person in my area so I tried them through amazon. This is the second time I have been disappointed in the color I received. The first color Chelsea Girls was one that a magazine recommended for fair skinned women. It looked like I used concealer on my mouth. BLECH! But I liked the formula. So I tried again and went with Baby Doll which the image depicts as a bright clear red. I got a pale pink so close to my lipcolor that it is a total waste of the time I spend putting it on. Any generic clear gloss would offer more payoff because it would at least have shine going for it, instead of the subtle dewy finish the lacquer offers. In red it would have been a neat effect, in baby doll it is a $24 source of considerable annoyance. It is made worse by the fact that it took nearly a week to get here despite being prime eligible. I also attempted to cancel this product 3 days before it arrived (I recieved several glosses as a gift in the interim) and was told it could not be canceled. WHY NOT? It clearly wasn't already in transit if I didn't get it til 3 days later. I would strongly recommend using any other supplier for this product. I generally adore amazon but they seriously dropped the ball here."
247774,1,"This is a light fresh everyday kinda scent. Even though its light it still sticks with you for a while, but its not overpowering. Couple shots of this and your hook up for a while."
66269,0,"I didn't like the smell of this product, I' would not recommend this one, due to the smell of it alone."
125264,1,"Easy to use, doesn't stain your clothes, and the results are great-a nice glow that can be changed to a deep tan with repeated use."
156505,0,"This product is good, I just was not as satisfied with the color as I would have liked. But the product was shipped fast and it is of good quality."
63993,2,"Bright Crystal Versace is a young, bright, cute fruity-floral musk. It has a clean edge, a sweet edge, and a sexy one too - that seems unique in my book. It's a pretty & versatile scent, but it's most certainly not my style.Classic fragrances are ageless. This one isn't. The ad is not the target market - it's a reflection of what the wearer wants to be, imo. Bright Crystal Versace seems targeted to the under 25 crowd."

55252,2,"I bought my Zeno back in October of 2007, so just a few months over one year ago. It worked like a charm, but I used up the 60 uses a few weeks back so today I went out and bought my first not-cheap replaceable cartridge, only to get it home and find that the non-replaceable battery inside the zeno will no longer charge. According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use. I'm very disappointed. The gadget worked when it was working...but yeah, SOOOO disappointed that my only options now are to do without or buy a whole new device. Frustrating to say the least."
231581,0,"It's perfect for french manicure, but for use alone doesn't work, is so clear; it's like clear polish with a little shade."
72654,0,"It takes a little while to know the quality of lipstick. After a couple of months, I can say that this brand is not great. Colors are not rich and they wear off fast. Nice case, but cases are not the reason to buy. I have bought other Guerlain cosmetics in person and they were always good. Maybe lipstick buying is not an online great."
189457,2,"I just received this item today and headed straight to the tanning salon after work. I rubbed it all over my face and body before I realized that my whole face was on fire. I looked in the mirror and realized my whole body was red. I then ran to the bathroom and washed my face. I then threw on my cloths and ran home to shower this stuff off and cover myself in benadryl. I have never had an allergic reaction like this in my life. I never even got in the tanner, it was all from this lotion. I have been using another Satori Sol product at the salon and loved it. The one with cooling. This one has tingle, which I am apparently alleric too. Try a small packett (or don't) before you buy a whole bottle of this."
177257,2,I am very displeased that my perfume was never delivered but they took the money out of my account. I will dispute the charge with my bank.
57664,0,"I felt that the Nivea Body Skin Firming Lotion was easy to use and very smooth. It smelled clean but I didn't like the smell. It took a little more time to soak in than I was used to with other lotions. As for the firming effect, I used it twice a day as directed, but I have yet to see any difference. Overall, I thought that it was a nice lotion, but to be truthful, I don't think that I would rush out to buy it."
96919,1,"I have been using this cologne for over 30 years. It is the only cologne I use. It is almost like a woodsy musk on me, but have purchased it for many friends and it smells differently on all of them. I guess it works with your skin composition. It compliments everone who uses it, and has a very unique aroma."
131727,0,Have been using Alon Selective products since I was a kids... LOVE IT! But this did not smell like I thought it would.
227369,0,"This product was recommended to me as part of a dry sensitive skin care regime. I find it does not irritate my skin at all which is good. But it does not moisturize enough for my very dry skin. I use it mixed with a moisturizing cream, especially in the winter."
117980,2,"To be honest, this product didn't work for my acne. If I used it on entire face, then the face gets really dry and itchy. Then I tried on spots only. But it did nothing to reduce acne. Sorry, didn't work for me."
196942,0,The Chi... well what can I say was okay.. I was hoping it was better its not all that what I thought it was..
251493,0,"I bought Lychee Luxe after trying it in a store. I thought the sample on display was a test size - nope, it really is that tiny.As far as stickiness, it's pretty darn sticky and goopey - the true definition of ""gloss"". My hair gets stuck in it a bunch which I hate.The color is really pretty, especially as spring is rolling in.However, there are plenty of better glosses I have tried that are much, much cheaper. I will not be buying this in the future because it is just too darn expensive for the size and quality. Thought the tube would last way longer. Disappointing.I would have paid maybe $8 dollars for this, but oh well, live and learn."
126427,1,"Great product, actually produces more lather than I expected from a sulfate free shampoo. Love the mint smell, leaves my hair very manageable and not overly dry."
150318,2,"I have thick asian hair and conditioning is sometimes an issue. This conditioner unfortunately, was no miracle for me. It works no better than any standard Suave conditioner you can pick up at your local Target. Don't waste your money, you're better off making a trip to the local store for something much cheaper."
70085,1,OPI is the best... so worth the $$. I ordered two bottles of Koala Bear-y... GREAT service! Fast and no issues. Thank YOU!
129869,0,"For a ""lotion"" this is lacking. I would put this on at night after I showered and shaved my legs, and my legs would feel dry again in the morning.However, the scent is superior to any other self-tanning product I've used, and I felt like it provided a nice, gradual tan that looked real! If you buy this strictly for the self-tanning properties, I'd so go for it, but as a ""moisturizer"" it wasn't great."
234240,0,"It's a great lotion to use if you don't like the feeling of tingle because the tingle power is very very mild and can barely be felt. It's more of a pleasant cooling sensation than that uncomfortable, my-skin-is-on-fire feeling! Definitely helps improve a tan quickly, even if you're at a tanning plateau!"
126762,0,"I bought this kit and was pleasantly surprised to the packaging it came in, very nice, the scent wasn't as heavenly as I was hoping but the products are pleasant, nothing extravagant. The scent to me personally was that of someone older. The lotion goes on well, not too greasy but pleasant, the conditioner works great and works well on my baby's fine hair, the bath gel is just like any other, the bath salts are okay nothing to rant about. I like the products however, I just personally didn't care for the scent all that much; again I wasn't overly impressed considering the price."
168665,0,"I was disapointed. Its smelled more like eau de toilett, then eau de parfume. It would be better to buy the tester for me."
234518,0,I just finished my second month. I think I feel a difference so far. Possibly a little more thicker. I sit it on my bathroom sink so it reminds me to put it on. So far ive done good and havent missed a day (twice a day applications)I give it 3 stars because I did notice that it makes me break out around the hairline. I normally dont break out at all so this was unusual for me. Im going to continue using it twice daily for the rest of the 3 months. I will update once the 3 months are up.
121307,0,"I just got this dryer as a replacement for an older Hot Tools Professional Ionic dryer. I relax my hair and use the comb attachment on every dry. This dryer is very light in your hands compared to the old model which is nice. Although it's 1875 watts, it doesn't feel like it gets very hot. My hair too came out pretty frizzy and took a lot longer to dry. I kept wondering if I had it set on low. My hair definitely feels soft, even if it is frizzy. I didn't think it was too loud, but then again, my old dryer is obnoxious so anything sounds better. I do like the 8ft cord and the long prongs on the comb attachment. I'll give this thing one more try but right now, it might be going back to the store."
54524,0,"I was hoping for a wooden stick that wouldn't crack under medium pressure for cleaning. Other than that, they work as anticipated."
169393,0,"This dye is meant to be used on light or bleached hair. so if your hair is black, it will not stay.Anyway, I did bleach my hair before using this, and it's ok. It faded sooner than the usual brand of hair dye that I use, which I ended up mixing it with for the next application. I won't be buying it again, though. it also kind of smells weird, for a dye that doesn't have bleach in it."
118010,2,"I had this on my nails for 3 days when they started to really hurt and turn blue. When I took the polish off, my nails looked bruised. It felt like needles had punctured the nail bed. I do think the product is so heavy it cuts off all circulation and oxygen to the nails. My nails are on the thin side, so perhaps that is why I had that reaction, but I assume most people using this product have thin nails. Use with caution!!"
197401,2,THIS PRODUCT PULLED MY HAIR AND DID NOT HEAT PROPERLY... LEFT MY HAIR FRIZZY AND DID NOT STRAITEN IT CORRECTLY
184080,1,"It's rare I say this, but I'll probably buy a back up. I have my go to color, there are around 10 but my top 5 rarely change and Tantalize Me took the place of a my Orly purple that I used all the time.Like most china glaze polishes this does need 2 coats. It is a light purple that reflects light bluish tones in direct light, it's the kind of polish you start moving you hand and your eyes get hooked to. I love this color and totally recommend it to other people."
148262,1,"Someone gave this to me last week, they had cleaned out a foreclosure and this was there, still in the box. Well, I am 55 yrs old, live in sw florida. Enjoy the sun whole heartedly and basically, don't do anything special for my face, except that I do use sunscreen. This stuff is amazing. Really. I had some fine lines above my top lip. They are gone after just 2 uses!And my neck - unbelievable - so, buy it, its good stuff ladies."
151478,1,"I bought this as a primary hair dryer. My hair is thin but I have lots of it. It goes to a little below my chin and almost to my shoulders. I needed a replacement dryer after my previous one died, but I am on this cost-savings mission and so I wanted to get one for as little money as possible. Therefore, I went on Amazon and did a search for dryers with 4+ star ratings and then sorted by price. This was the cheapest of the 4 star rating at the time of my search, which was maybe a few months ago. I like this dryer. It does what it advertises. It is light weight and has dual settings. You can make it blow cool or hot. I have found though that it does take longer to dry my hair with this dryer than with more expensive ones. So, while I do like this dryer, I think I would prefer a more expensive high powered model when my hair grows longer. For people with short hair or sparse hair or guys with crew cuts, I think this would be useful. For the price, this was very good."
62541,0,"I liked this conditioner on my rebonded hair. Even while my roots were growing out, it seems to work well. Although now I have switched to Bed Head but I think it's worth buying for someone with thick, frizzy and out of control hair."
15995,1,"Got it for Christmas for my Dad, its my favorite cologne and his as well.If you want an amazing smell that isn't overpowering but subtle and clean, this is the one!"
26572,2,"I spent more than I wanted to trying to find a ""booster seat"" for my hot tub. At 5'1"" I need a little lift. These cushions are hard to keep under your bottom and don't raise me enough. For the cost, I expected a better product."
237998,0,That's all I can say. Lathers better and is thicker Doc Woods. I will try another brand the next time I order. This was relatively inexpensive given how much I paid for the inferior Doc Woods product earlier.

199411,1,"I liked this product. I liked the fact that there weren't too many other ingredients in it. I was looking for a product that had only aloe in it, this was the best I've found so far."
223919,1,"When women wear this, I go crazy!!! This has to be the best perfume ever. I dont know what they put in this, but it hypnotizes me..LOL I would recommend any women buy this!!"
1145,0,"I don't like how these always show a little one with poker straight hair! It is NOT going to straighten your childs hair like that! My daughter wants her hair straightened and I have tried several different relaxers. They are just that- RELAXERS. Don;t expect the hair to look ANYTHING as it does on the box :) But I will say, my daughter has VERY thick hair and after using this (or any of these I've tried- I can run a big tooth comb through her hair when it is wet- that is only a dream before using a relaxer :)"

22466,0,"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once. It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years. Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
247984,2,"I have no doubt that this is high quality and pure, but applying it to the skin is not very easy. The texture is thick (imagine butter) and it leaves skin greasy and I have to wait a long time before I can put clothes on. I end up being too lazy to use this and used other lotions (which contains some shea butter). Maybe pure shea butter is not the most practical skin care product to use."
186037,2,"I've used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one. The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated. I stopped using it after two weeks, hoping that this was just a phase of the product I would have to endure, but alas, my skin just got worse. I went back to my Aveeno lotion, and my skin calmed down after a few days. I will never buy this product again, it was so uncomfortable having itchy skin on my face, knowing that were I to scratch it, I would only make it worse."
225108,0,The rollers work fine but there are a few annoying factors that lead me to believe someone that has never used hot rollers designed it...a) The lid is not hinged and always falls offb) The 3 different sized clips live in one compartment so each time I use them I have to sort them first.Just little things that could easily be fixed with a more thoughtful design.
10033,1,"It is an excellent product, but it is hard to find my favorite color in the normal stores. It's worth the hassle of ordering it though. I get compliments on my hair color from people I don't know all the time. I use SPICE TEA with dark brown hair, It gives me red highlights!"
15227,1,"I was wary about trying another product that would supposedly solve my ingrown hair problems especially with the cost and the seemingly small amount you get.I use an epilator so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs, I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference. It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer. I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.I would recommend this product because even though you don't seem to get a lot it's worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good. Also it doesn't really smell.Cons: It takes a couple of seconds to dry after application but that's really not that bad."
241496,0,It didnt do what I thought it would...I was told it would make my nails hard like acrylic...and it didnt do that
154864,2,"I orderd this item, despite the bad reviews i read. All the bad reviews i read were correct. The barrel does not spin as described, in fact, you press the button and it does absolutely nothing. I returned the 1st one, acepted the replacement, and sure enough the 2nd one did not spin either. This product should be removed from the market. Waste of time. Gave it one star becuase you cant put zero stars."
75878,0,"I loved the smell at first, when I saw the sampler in a magazine. When I wear the perfume, it feels good. Not a great one, but a good one. But, the smell doesn't stay beyond couple of hours. When I used it for work place, by afternoon, no hint of Lovely!I'm not a hater of this perfume. But nothing motivates me to buy this again!"
194522,0,The green nail polish looked very bright and opaque on amazon. I thought it would be cute under OPI's black shatter. So I bought it and it turned out looking like marker on my nails. I had to layer like 4 or 5 coats and it still wasn't the true color. A bit disappointing and not very opaque. The color isn't a bright once you do 4 or 5 coats but it doesn't look as much like marker.
115107,0,These were very pretty but arrived much smaller then I anticipated. I bought them for a 14 year old girl for Christmas and suspect they may be more intended for someone maybe 8-10.
116053,2,"If this is the original formula for the After Bath Splash, it is watered down with something. It almost smells right - but not really. I have left the top off in hopes that evaporation will condense it down to the right fragrance. I used this product from 1960 to 2008-ish (when I could no longer find it), so I certainly know what I'm talking about. I would rather pay more for it and get the real thing."
58161,0,"Let's face it: anyone who buys from Jason, a company whose logo says ""Pure, Natural & Organic"", is doing so because they don't want to put on their skin the toxins found in most commercial skin care products. I really like the texture and feel of Jason products and I was happily using several of them when I received an email newsletter which said that Organic Consumers Association had recently tested 100 ""Organic"" or ""Natural"" products for contamination with 1,4 dioxane, a carcinogen that often results from the manufacturing process of PEG, polyethylene, Oxynol and ingredients ending with ""eth"". More than half of these ""organic"" products had 1,4 dioxane. Unfortunately, Jason is one of them. The ingredients list for Jason Lifting Eye Creme are better than most, which is why I didn't give them the poorest rating. There are no parabens or other known carcinogens, but they have fallen down by the inclusion of one ingredient, Ceteareth-20. While the FDA has never set a limit for 1,4 dioxane content and it's possible Ceteareth can be in a skin product without contamination, the fact that some Jason products are contaminated makes me suspicious that they lack the kind of quality control which would prevent it. You're better off using this eye cream than something from your local drug store or department store, but there are products out there that are clear of 1,4 dioxane. Look for 100% certified USDA organic products, because no certified organic products were found to be contaminated."
12351,0,"Because the fragrance only lasts about three hours or maybe four. I've tried it in the past so, I decided to try it again because I needed some perfume."

156836,0,This nail polish is very thin and goes on extremely sheer. You need at least 4 coats to make it opaque and to get the color you want.
228247,0,"Just a note that there are lots of nylon posts in the bristles and those posts aren't exactly smooth. If you have lots and lots of hair, I can see this being a plus, but if you have thinning hair of any kind, I'd avoid this brush and stick with one having 100% bristles."
106341,2,"I bought this before vacation ""in case of a sunburn"". Well, the burn happened but the spray didn't help. It feels good going on, but the relief is temporary and did not provide the moisture my skin needed. When you look at the ingredients #3 is alcohol...not such a good thing for burned, dehydrated skin. We ended up buying an aloe gel at the gift shop and I feel much better!"
44021,0,"This baby shampoo performed well: good lather, cleaned the hair well, didn't irritate our eyes, and smelled good. Although I was satisfied with the results of my Test Drive, I wasn't overly impressed with the product and wouldn't switch from my normal brand."
212858,0,It doesn't live up to the Trind name but I still use it. I've have others that cost about the same but costs less.
207679,1,"The good news is that this is a great fragrance for guys over 30. I found it years ago in a U.S. department store. The name refers to an Italian tennis star. While the company that makes toiletries and clothing that uses his name is still in business, this fragrance is no longer manufactured. That's the bad news. The replacement is a bit too strong for my taste. I was very pleased with the speed and condition of the bottles I ordered as well as the price."
155505,2,"It was evident to me in the opening chapter that this book would not be successful in making the case for improving relationships by setting ""boundaries"". Although it succeeds in overusing the term ""boundary"", it fails at improving relationships.The most critical chapter of the book, on Boundaries and God (Chapt. 13), should have been the crux of the entire book. God is the author of relationships, thus He is the authority on how to improve our relationships. This chapter should have clearly and concisely presented the Gospel message of how a Holy God restores humanity to himself by atoning our sins for His Son's blood on the cross. Only after restoration of our relationship to God, may we even have a hope at healthy relationships with others.Not only should the book have opened with this chapter, it completely loses credibility by omitting the most crucial part of our existence- we are all sinners, who sinned against a Holy God. It states ""the main reason loving God and our neighbor is difficult is because of boundary problems- problems of responsibility"". Completely false!In an effort to maintain continuity in their excessive use of ""boundarylessness"", the authors irresponsibly infer that we have difficulty loving God and others simply because we don't know or exercise our boundaries; thus removing sin out of the picture. The Bible is explicitly clear that we can not nor ever will be able to love God or one another because God is love and the source of love. Through sin we are separated from Him until we are reconciled through repentance and trust in Jesus' atoning blood.The authors say ""But at the same time, [God] does not rescue us; he wants us to work it out for our own good"". The Bible says ""For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast"" (Ephesians 2:8-9). Without the presence of God's Holy Spirit, there is no power, let alone desire innately in any of us to love God or one another. The Holy Spirit is a gift to the believer after salvation. There is no mention throughout this entire book of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Scripture tells us no one does good. No, not one (Romans 3:10). Apart from Christ, we do not have the capacity to ""change for our own good and [God's] glory. Our deeds are but filthy rags to Him (Isaiah 64:6).On a positive note, the story about Jerry, the adulterer, involved confession and repentance. The Bible tells us these kinds of gestures honor God and lead to restoration of relationship with Him. Repentance must also be followed up with trust in Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, the authors cram this authentic example into a ""boundary"" box.Another major failure is that the authors absolutely neglect God's holiness. They boil his character down to just another human relationship. This is a distorted view of how great God is and how significant a relationship with Him is. He is the Creator and is worthy to be revered as such. He is not our pal who simply desires us to hang with him every once in a while.The authors state that ""The basic problem in human relationship is that of freedom"". Wrong! The Bible tells us the basic problem in any relationship is sin. Adam did not fall from fellowship with God because of freedom. The Fall occurred because of sin. That's theology 101.In the last section of the chapter, the authors give us their opinions of what they think the gospel is, but never proclaim the Gospel message as told by the Scriptures. In 302 pages, they manage to support their nauseating premise on how defining boundaries will improve our relationships, and never once present the Good News. All Christians are instructed to share the Good News where ever we go. True change in any relationship begins with the Good News of Jesus Christ dying to save sinners. Apart from Christ we have no life at all. We are walking dead men."
46809,1,"All the glowing reviews were right! This is the richest lotion I think I've ever used, but it also absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft. My daughter--who usually dislikes body lotion because of the slippery feeling some of them leave on your skin for a few minutes--really loves this. I wish the vanilla smell lasted longer, but I guess it's hard to have something fast-absoring and with a lasting fragrance."
34229,1,After Burts Bee's was purchased by Clorox -- i needed to find a new organic/cruelty free product. The Suki facial toner works very well! It smells wonderful without smelling perfume-y. Very gentle and refreshing on the skin. My skin feels fresh and hydrated. I spritz it on before bed and in the morning. I would recommend this product.
25738,0,I really liked this product but didn't like that it seems to be something you only use once. As soon as I put it in the tub it started to melt very quickly. That seems a bit extreme for the price of it. Much smaller ones should be made and in packs so that you can have one to put in the tub when you want to and it wouldn't be too much. I think one whole large one is too much for one bath. There also should be instructions with their products. I noticed a lot of their items do not have any.
247081,2,Vendor accuses me of lying about never receiveing product. According to them: THE CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS WRONG!~
114527,2,"Tried the shampoo for four months, then also tried the expensive hair and scalp lotion with booster from Kevis. It did nothing to stop hair loss.

86156,2,"This scent seems to have been a bit more offensive than the last one we tried, but it's not strong enough for a dedicated nail biter. I had optomistic hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my daughter's nailbiting problem. She said it tasted gross, but not bad enough for her to keep her fingers out of his mouth. I've tried other similar products that also were not effective but maybe it is good for others."
4761,1,"Yes, Yes! Horray! The day has finally come. I've found a facial cleanser I never want to give up. Like many i've tried everything that's come out, wasting a lot of money in the process. I gave up and went to a dermatologist after trying to battle occasional breakouts, combination skin ( or i think that's what it is. . .it's oily, it's dry,... it's everything thrown together), and facewashes that left my face feeling tight. This is what she gave me. She uses it and the Neutragena Moisture with SPF 15...and that's it. Oh, and Aveno lotion on the rest of her body. No other products. No wrinkle cream. No eye cream. Nothing.So, I pitched everything else and my skin's so much happier. It's been almost a year and i'll never switch again. I hope this saves someone a lot of frustration."
170334,2,"The Iconic Frostbite is all over the nail blogs as the ""it"" color.. frosty high luster medium blue with fire within.Well.. I don't know why but this bottle I got from here was dark.. more like a slightly shimmery navy. Not pretty on my olive skin. I was expecting the color in the blogs.. a vibrant beautiful light Royal blue.. instead.. it is quite dark.. with a slight shimmer if you put your hand in the sun... just looks like Navy cream polish...I don't know if the formula is different.. I don't know if this is a second? I don't know if the blogs lie... but you know mailing it back would just cost more than the whole thing is worth.I guess.. if you are looking for the Iconic Blue in the Blogs.. try buying in person and try on...Just looked too dark.. and was totally not what I expected.. very sad..."
79409,1,Helps keep in my red color hair I'm satisfied with my purchase and I was recommended by a friend to give it a try.
105272,2,"I have bought this product for years from my salon. I thought I would buy it online to save a trip to my salon. Considering how often I use this product, I noticed right away that the color was off. Then when I used it, it was obvious that the product was fake considering the consistency was very different. Finally when I used it, my hair was full of knots and unusually dry. I'm disappointed that I bought two bottles. Please, please be aware that Deal Seakers is selling FAKE Bumble and Bumble products! Unacceptable."
153816,0,"Everyone has different hair, so shampoo and conditioner are very personal things. I have long, shiny hair that is prone to split ends. My hair waves when it is humid. My scalp is oily. I wash my hair everyday. This product has been decent for me (shampoo is pretty good) but this smells musty and gross! I've noticed the same problem withDove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce (Pack of 2), which used to smell good and work a lot better. I never used this line with the original formulation, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect that this conditioner used to work a lot better too because the Cool Moisture Conditioner is just the same product (it has the same ingredients) with a different fragrance thrown in. Otherwise, this conditions fine, and leaves my hair smooth. It's nothing special, but good for the price. Usually I pick between this, Aussie, or Pantene, depending on which one is the cheapest at the time. This is not to be confused with Dove's Damage Therapy Intensive Repair line (Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Shampoo, 25.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)), which I once accidentally bought instead of this and had to give to my mother because it REALLY doesn't work for my hair."
251504,2,"This is heavy and makes my hands sticky when applying it. Nioxin is for fine and/or thinning hair. This doesn't ""shine"" it just takes the fluff out of my hair and makes it lay flat. Not at all what I was expecting. In general, I love their products, have been using them for years.. but will never order this again."
196962,2,"was promised a replacement, they requested my address to send a replacement but even after my follow-up never got the replacement."
142208,0,This soap lathers up very well smells great and was very quickly shipped by the seller.
241889,1,I use this gel with B5 design Gel by Aubrey it creates a balance add the Giovanni first then the other Love this stuff and its chemical Free!!!
25842,2,this is fake paco xs . the bottle and sticker is not the real one!! smell right but doesn't last long. very up set to order
106586,0,This shampoo replaced a wonderful Pantene product that helped hold the color red and enhanced it. This one is the one that is available so I am stuck. It cleans my hair beautifully but does not enrich the color as the previous product did so well.
110375,2,I cannot STAND the smell of this. I love the smell of coconut....but this is not it. Overpowering and just flat rank.
30994,0,"If you use this product right after a hot shower, it will sting and burn! oww!I didn't notice much results with the use of this product. It didn't seem to make my blemishes go away any faster, although I do feel it kept them under control.I recommend getting the &quot;Desert Essence&quot; Tea Tree Oil instead. Put a few drops on a cotton pad with witch hazel, and use it all over your face 2 or more times a day. It doesn't sting and helps blemishes heal faster. The only benefit of the blemish stick over the Tea Tree oil is that it smells nicer."
185086,0,I like the fact that it does cut the hair pretty good but the vacuum is not working as good as advertised. Hair still go all over the place not as much as without still hair all over the floor and sink even if I empty it several times during the cutting.
151514,2,"I actually have the 1.7 oz spray of horizion, thank goodness. Another scent that was short lived for guy laroche, whos best known scent is Drakkar. This scent reminds me at times of an older womans overpowering perfume, or the bad scent of original polo. It has a more mossy smell, and at time I swear it can smell like a locker room, not cool. Not close to his Drakkar line, thank goodness guy laroche didn't name it after it, because this may have stoped his sales. Something different, but not an every day scent by far, and use sparingly."
106240,0,This item is good gift choice. But there is no discount at Amazon. I could have bought it for the same price at Calvin kliene store in the outlet mall. I would suggest to check out the product at the local mall before buying at Amazon.
189362,0,Maybe it is not for my skin type. I've read that in some other did work. My skin is too sensitive.Thanks anyway.
29310,2,"i got this item after reading all the reviews. I wasnt impressed with the scent, reminded me of an old closet smell, i'm 34yrs old and enjoy a variety of both subtle and pronounced scents but this wasnt fresh smelling at all. I ended up mixing with another oil perfume i had so i wouldnt waste it."
207736,0,its a great conditioning lotion. i like it better than the other leading brand of hair lotions
154001,1,This is the perfect bath pillow.Secure and sturdy it easily stays in placeand doesn't require inflating.
226293,2,Not a great perfume and not worth for this price. Smells sandal thatz it. this note is worth for $ 15 or so.Try this before you buy.
201889,1,"Awe, this color Marshmallow by Essie holds a special place in my heart. I used this white nail polish for white on white french manicures for 10 years and I used to get compliments non stop. I wear short dark nails now but I never forgot where it all started for me, with Essie Marshmallow. Best white polish ever."
141697,0,"I was very excited to get this makeup case, I have been wanting one for a long time! It looks amazing and i love how one side of the train is deep as my nail polish collection fits there just fine. It was quite dissapointing to open it though as the train seemed really weak and ws hard to open. I have been using it for about a month now, and I do have to say, that it is getting easier and easier to open and close the train. I still get a bit stressed sometimes, thinking I might break it, but I think that is just me being paranoid. So basically it is a good product, but i don't think i would pick it again."
129326,2,"It turned out to be nothing like described. The jaws do NOT open wide enough to handle thick long nails. There was no sharp clipping. My nails were completely mangled...shredded, ruining several pairs of socks. The grip is comfortable, but what good is that if it doesn't perform to specifications?"
92592,0,"This shampoo sounds like it might be biodegradable and thus environmentally safe to use when camping. I can't tell from the ingredients, but if someone knows, please add a review because I would love to use this instead of the age-old camping shampoo that makes hair feel like felt."
156898,2,"I am asian and my hair is naturally black and i've been using this brand from the Philippines and it works. but somehow, when i tried the US brand, it didn't work on me. maybe the problem is this color or asian hairs are thicker than american."
116887,0,I look like a pixie every time I put this stuff on my face... it's just too micro-sparkly for me.
243696,2,I did not like this. I'm sensitive to perfumes and the fragrance in this moisturizer was too strong for me.
152962,1,"My husband has a skin condition on his hands which causes costant redness, peeling and cracking. We've tried everything natural and holistic (even oral Flax oil) and nothing seemed to work with any dependability for very long. I had a sample jar of the Beesway Hand Creme in a sample package and rubbed it on his hands one night to see what it would do. He continued doing this for 2 nights and on the third day proclaimed ""this stuff works!"" His hands were softer, the cracking had stopped and it appears like his hands are healing. I bought him some cotton gloves to wear at night to see if would help the creme penetrate even further. Anyhow take it from us THIS STUFF WORKS. And it isn't even winter yet!!"
98740,0,Can't understand why we can't get this stuff sent to a Military APO in Germany. Had to send to family to forward to us at an extra expense. Not Good!!!!
33071,1,"This is an excellent line of products that are paraben free! I can feel this eye serum tightning the skin around my eyes, right when I put it on. If it works for women over 40, then it should work for women in their 30s too! I feel good about supporting a women owned company that uses only natural ingredients!"
87273,0,"I always use Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo. I saw this and it is organic, so I thought I would try it. I don't think it works as well. It doesn't make your scalp tingle at all either. I think it doesn't have enough tea tree oil in it. I wouldn't buy it again but it works alright."
233512,0,"I decided to keep this fragrance for those once-in-a-while occasions when I want something different. It is both sharp and sweet, almost like air fresheners or kids scents, I can't be taken seriously wearing this. But it is very happy and youthful, so maybe a good Friday fragrance... Not totally me, I think I will stick to more sophisticated perfume houses in the future, Bvlgari or Hermes..."
70257,0,I bought several items from this line at the mall. I like them a lot but was VERY sorry I bought them at the mall since the Amazon prices are WAY better!
3479,2,"Well, the short answer is that Robathol is just too oily for me. To be a bit more specific, no matter how well you rinse, there is still an oily feel which some might like, but is not for me. I really wanted to like it as it was highly recommended to me by a friend who likes the product very much."
97150,1,The Duo saves me money since me and my stepdaughter both use this product and it seems to go a long way. I also use other Pureology products.
45945,1,"When I ordered this product for a Christmas gift for my niece, I didn't understand that it came with hand cream. It was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived. Amazon had the best price and ordering from them is always so very, very easy. I recommend this product and Amazon!!!"
244447,1,"I got this lotion to help with my acne. I am 30 and have had moderate to severe acne since my early teens. It has worsened in recent years. I'd heard good things about glycolic acid as a really thorough exfoliator, which can help cut down on acne. I thought, for $10, I had nothing to lose by trying it. After washing with a mild non-soap cleanser, I put on the AHA Enhanced Lotion before bed and took my niacin and zinc supplements. I expected it would take a couple of weeks before I saw a measurable difference in my skin, if any; either that, or I'd react poorly to it and would wake up with a bad breakout.To my surprise, after ONE USE my skin was noticeably improved. I woke the next morning and stared in amazement at my face in the mirror -- not only were all my acne spots smaller and MUCH less inflamed than when I'd gone to bed, but my skin had an overall healthy glow to it that is has literally never, ever had before, except perhaps when I was a very young child. The dark red scars all over my cheeks from years' worth of bad breakouts were noticeably lighter. After one use. I was really amazed and couldn't believe the results -- I had to take pictures of myself and compare them to older pictures to be sure I wasn't crazy (I wasn't!).I've now been using AHA Enhanced nightly for about a month. In that time, my skin has been closer to 100% clear than I ever dreamed it could be. It's not totally blemish-free, but the zits I do have are tiny, infrequent, and clear within a day or two (I should note, the supplements I'm taking also have had a noticeable effect, noted before I started using this lotion, so I can't say that my acne success is 100% because of AHA...but it's most definitely helped!) I have also noticed a visible reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. No, this lotion will not make your lines go away entirely, but I have been happy to note that it seems to have turned back the clock on my skin by five years or so. :) I'm hoping that continued use will smooth out the deeper line on my forehead (at least I only have one!) and help prevent more from forming.In addition to using it on my face, I've been using it on my shoulders and back to help clear up my body breakouts. there, too, it's done a remarkable job of reducing the amount of time my spots stick around, reducing redness, and reducing size.I am going to start using the lotion on my entire body because I am enjoying the soft texture and glowing appearance of my face and neck so much.I normally have very sensitive skin and I notice hardly any stinging when using this lotion. It goes away within a couple of minutes.The only drawbacks for me have been the smell -- many people have remarked that this lotion is scent-free, but it does have a noticeably unpleasant odor in my opinion. However, that goes away quickly as the lotion sinks into your skin. This lotion also does such a great job of exfoliating that I've had little flakes form on my face -- something that never ever happened to me before using, since I never could exfoliate well enough before this lotion to make a difference with my acne. But a few quick checks in the mirror daily keep facial flakes from becoming too numerous.I'll be an AHA user for life! This is great stuff!!"
169408,1,Purchased this for a family member after hearing great things. It has lived up to the hype. Leaves the hair softer and more manageable than all the other dryers tried over the years. It is also relatively quieter so you don't need earplugs. Since then have purchased another for a different family member.
247850,1,This is a great smelling cologne for me. I love it! The price was great too.
128774,1,delicious smell. a great summery alternative for those of us who like the gingerbread man scrub. the scub is makes me feel super smooth without leaving an oily feel on the skin like other scrubs i've used before.
137409,1,"It goes on really well hardly any streaking. Had to apply 3 coats but it's fine, doesn't take up that much time. China glaze shocking pink is too cute :)"
47466,1,"I take this traveling with me in case I get any cuts or scrapes. It has come in very hand a few times, and heals my hand. There is no the burning sensation of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, so you know its gentler on the body."
103076,0,"I got this product because my skin was getting really dry from the winter weather. I didn't think I needed a night cream yet so I got this to hydrate my skin at night.This product left the strangest sticky residue on my face. I really do not like that at all. I will finish this particular product and not ever buy this hydrating cream again. I use Olay's daily moisturizer and I love that product. This one, just is not working for me."
27612,0,It has good magnification but is smaller than I thought. It is ok but i would not buy it again.
164757,2,Purchased about 6 1/2 months ago and the spring just went out on it so it will not close to hold the hair.
149000,0,"I bought this planning on using it on a particularly bad spot of Psoriasis on my scalp. It does seem to help, but the messiness outweighs the usefulness of this product to some degree. I use it directly out of the shower before bed and always shower in the morning. I can't imagine leaving it in during the day since it has such a powerful fragrence and ends up matting the hair after it dries. I'm still undecided on whether or not I'll buy again since the price of this product is so low."
48007,2,"I ordered this product because I read other reviews claiming that it was ""the best dry shampoo."" It was a great price, under $5 and I was very excited to get it.The product came quickly and I tried it immediately. But was unpleased with the results. This product turned my hair white [my hair is dark blonde/light brown]and although the white color brushed out easily, it really didn't do anything for it. It didn't make it look clean or shiny as it claimed it did.Basically, I wasted $5 to find out this product doesn't work. I'd be interested in trying another one, though I hope it works next time."
227366,0,"It's a very light, very forgettable fragrance. Nothing distinct about it that would inspire one to choose it as their ""signature fragrance."" I got it for a birthday gift and I doubt I will ever be wearing it. It fades off my skin after about 30 minutes (I usually keep perfume scents very well). Maybe I will spray my linens with it because it IS a pleasant scent."
216666,2,They sent a bottle half the size as discribed. They have done nothing to correct the mistake!!!!! I have emailed them over a month ago and have been waiting patiently for another bottle to be sent. I've emailed twice since then and have gotten 0 responses. Complete rip off!!!!
182968,0,"Ive had this blow dryer for about a 1 1/2 and it still works fine. Im not a fan personally: I would like if it weighed a little less, Im a hairdresser and on my feet all day. The cord is short, maybe its a long enough for personal use, not in a salon! It gets the job done, but Ive learned to research a little harder in the future."
194785,0,"I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
181685,0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
159718,0,"Great product; moisturizes very well. We live in Southern California where the humidity can drop to 12% when the Santa Ana winds blow. This is the perfect remedy for those days. It lasts all day, and eliminates the need for lotion after the shower. However; wow the scent is way too strong. I hate to use it before bed as it just clings. If anyone from Dove reads these reviews - please, please consider reducing the level of the scent and/or replacing it with something mild like the old original Dove bar soap scent."
164471,0,"I purchased this product because Burt's products are usually great. I'm not saying it's not great for around the eyes, just don't get it in them. It burns the inside of the eye because if your not super careful when you put it around the eye, it's a serum and can run into the eye."
229751,0,"Since I'm buying this item through Amazon I was confident even though it was sold by a third party seller. However, when I received the product, package appeared to have been corrected. The original packaging was cut & peeled out in few places in the front and completely in the back (Looks like it was cut out intentionally so it can not be sold as new). Reprinted sticker was attached on top of the original packaging. Of course you are not going to find fixed up package sold as new at the legitimate store but this one was sold at a discounted price. My wife who use this product thinks inside seems like a genuine article. My guess is seller bought this as defective/reject item at a low wholesale price, fix or in this case tape over the damage area, and sold it. I guess I could've returned it but you get what you pay for right? And in this case you are using what's inside the box. If it wasn't for the patched up packaging I would give the seller and the product 5 stars."
83436,0,For the price of this product I expected more of a payoff. It's only good for the inside of your eye by the tear duct. Plus the applicatior bleeds out to much product thats wasted. Don't waste your money on this
211867,0,"I thought I finally found a product to help with my aging skin (I'm in my forties). It cleans really well and love the way the unit is made, very well and hopefully will last a long time, but after using for 4 weeks I haven't noticed any change with my pores unfortunately."
30374,2,This product arrived totally rock solid frozen! I am using it as I was completely out of it. It is very watery. I won't be purchasing it again.
28217,2,Based on very positive reviews I finally decided to try Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash. After using it just once I was unimpressed but I continued to use it daily and I'm disappointed to say it works no better than much cheaper drugstore brands like Neutrogena or Olay. I'll finish the bottle but won't be ordering it again. I'm subtracting one star simply because of the price.
85204,1,"I can't really live without this little gem. Been using one for about 11 years. It generally lasts about 2-3 years, and when batteries no longer work, it's time to buy another.There is nothing like it anywhere. (I just wish I had the foresight to order one before the batteries died today.)"
139704,2,first when i felt the brush it was really soft but then at the night i tried it on my face. it was so harsh on my skin. my opinion i hate it.
205079,2,"I have used this perfume for years and I do know how it smells. I'v got this one today from Amazon. This is not original Kenzo Ca Sent Beau. It smells horrible. Unless it was stored somewhere for long time and the perfume is spoiled. Perhaps, the packaging does not look like original either. I am very disappointed. It is trash."
44725,0,"Used this on my daughter's hair, and it turned out really, really bright. It looks like we colored her hair with a highlighter! Which was fine for us, but if you really want a banana yellow, I would pass on this one."
14063,2,"I had such high hopes for this product. In fact, before I purchased it I told everyone I'd found this amazing peel on Amazon but I take that back.I won't advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people. I'm african american with a medium complexion. I have combination skin with blocked pores and dark marks all over my face from acne. I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer. All of the marks on my skin are now darker than they were prior to using the product and it did nothing to combat acne. I didn't leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.For me, it wasn't worth it."
3214,0,I've been using the shampoo for nearly three weeks and have not had any type of reaction to my very reactive skin. since it is practically everything-free you have to use two or three applications to really get your hair clean.
10641,0,its kinda slimy feeling i think you could do more with a scrub than this. i dont use it anymore instead i use the indian clay mask and a deep conditioning cleanser and my face has been amazing!!
213390,1,"Like everyone else said, this is a MUST HAVE for nursing mommies. My husband fully contends that without this cream I wouldn't have made it past day 3. I was cracked and bleeding when I got home from the hospital, so my husband picked this up at Target for me. I was healed in a matter of days and am still happily nursing at 4 1/2 months."
121994,1,"Excellent fragrance! My husband is somewhat of a cologne connoisseur, and London passed the test with flying colors. It has a the perfect mix of that manly, earthly smell with a touch of sweetness. I belive my husband has found a new permanent scent."
231187,0,"The delivery was prompt and the condition of the item was great, but I was disappointed by the actual color of the polish. On this site, it looks to be a very light purple/lavender/lilac shade, but really, it's more of a light pink that you could get at any store."
90219,0,"The color of the powder is not the same that was shown in the profile, the color is not beige, is more white than beige.The item came well packed."
118159,1,"I had acrylic nails for 11 years before my real nails became too weak to withhold the acrylic. When I took off the acrylic for good, to allow my real nails to breath and hopefully strengthen, they were very fragile and would literally fall away like sand when filed. They would not grow back and were always breaking. Once I started using Duri Rejuvacote they immediately began to ""shape up"". They're now strong and healthy- I can now grow them to the length of what I previously had my acrylics at! My nail polish stays on longer too; LOVE Rejuvacote!"
118115,0,"I read all the reviews on these types of products. I have tried others, but they didn't seem to make my nails stronger so tried this. I feel as though it is helping slightly to strengthen my nails, but was quite disappointed that it peals off, even if it is used as a Top Coat, which it recommends to do.I had acrylic nails for many years. Evidently, it will take me many years to get them back where they need to be.If anyone knows of a product that works better then this, PLEASE let me know."
231611,0,"Smells good, feels good, but having gotten it for so cheap, I'm still not sure if it's the real thing or an imposter.

Seems to work o.k., so far.Aug. 21-09 O.K., I've been using it for several weeks now and really like it. The perfume grows on you. My hair seems to be getting healthier. Found a beauty supply store that let me feel a little bit of what this is supposed to be, and I'll guess this is the real stuff."
153985,1,"This blush is very light, but natural. I use it alone, or combine it on top of bronzers or darker blushes. It seems to blend well with most colors. Definitely a good ""basic "" to always have on hand."
107926,0,"I purchased this item as a replacement gift for a similar product that was nearing the end of its useful life (20 plus years). The old unit had fluorescent tubes as a light source. The new unit had four very small incandescent bulbs.Use of the new unit was straight forward. However selecting any light mode other than ""daylight"" turned on only two of the four bulbs which in addition to producing a very dim light, produced shadows on the face as makeup was being applied. Also, this unit did not have an electrical outlet on the front panel that was very convenient on the old product. There are better products out there, especially those with fluorescent tubes as the light source."
192034,2,"I've had a similar one to this many years ago. My disappointment was the foam on the curlers were awful-actually crumbling off the plastic before I'd even used it. When I called the company I was told they would replace them, but first I had to mail the original ones back to them. That means waiting for replacements, and no hair curlers in the meantime. Plus the cost to me of returning them. Not what I had expected."
145166,1,"I had barely dyed my hair for the first time this month with the L'Oreal Feria color dye from the store. It only gave a hint of red and lasted a week before it was completely gone. I then decided to go with the L'Oreal Hi Excellence. My original hair color is a dark brown, thick, and passed my middle back, and there was no isssue in the red actually showing up. It has now been two weeks and it's still noticeable. I keep getting compliments on this new hair color and I can't help but to enjoy the compliments. Someone the other day actually asked if I got it professionally done. I would definitely recommend this product."
179898,1,this color is hot and will be a great color for my 3d hello kitty nail art SUPER FAST AND GREAT SHOP
222368,1,"The product works as designed. I had no problems with it whatsoever. The appearance of the box, iron & components, upon delivery, was impeccable."
5088,1,"PROS: Long-lasting. Waterproof. Lightweight. Hypo-allergenic. Non-comedogenic. Fragrance free.CONS: Packaging is portable, however it becomes hard to get out when about 1/2 full. Only 3 shades (light, medium &amp; dark), but they are neutral, sheer and very blendable. Only SPF 6.First of all, the important thing to remember is that this is a *tinted moisturizer*. While it's still makeup, it's not meant to give full (or even medium) foundation-like coverage... you shoudn't expect this to completely disguise blemishes or freckles. It probably won't, but it will even skin tone. That said, the color selection is very limited, but, for most, I don't think that would be too much of a problem. The light shade looks dark and beige in the tube, but blends wonderfully and looks natural on my light, warm-toned skin. You should be safe as long as you don't go to the opposite end of the spectrum when choosing your shade. An SPF of at least 15 would be nice, but I suppose some is better than none, and I'm used to applying sunscreen anyway. It's very lightweight and feels natural, non-greasy and moisturizes sufficiently. It leaves a finish somewhere halfway between dewy and matte, making it look just like bare, healthy skin. It's waterproof, lasts for a very long time (though I can't attest to how it stands up during heavy activity) and washes off easily with a cleanser or makeup remover."

Suggest purchasing the ""testers"" for personal use to save a little money if you don't care about the top (or save the top from one of your bottles to reuse) or gift canister. Not the best as far as ""longevity"" with regard to the sent lasting but for the cost a good product."
155347,0,"The book is a good concept and there are good ideas and thoughts intermingled, but I didn't agree with a lot of things they said. The biggest part I disagreed with is dealing with kids' boundaries. But I think everyone has to decide that for themselves. I felt what they said about kids would lead them to become brats. On the other hand, I learned some things about my own boundaries that helped me to deal with my own parents."

For me, didn't work, dont care much how it smells."

235467,2,"I used Roasted Chestnut color for years. It lasted forever and never dried out my hair. I didn't think there would be a difference in the color or how long it last with the new ""improved"" version. I was very sadly mistaken. First, the new version did not cover up all my gray, and I don't have that much, yet. The old version did. Second, the new version doesn't even last a week. And even when I use the 2 week touch up, it only lasted a few days. I am so disappointed that Clairol changed the chemistry of their Natural Instincts line. It used to be a great product. I can't find a similar hair color like this one. And I have gone to the salon to get my hair colored and I still like the old Roasted Chestnut color the best. I'm sad that I won't be able to use it anymore, VERY SAD. I just loved that color."
205256,0,"I've been using this product for years, and I used to LOVE it, but now, I'd have to say I only ""like"" it. The latest bottle I bought seems to feel like a slightly different product. It still seems great as a sunblock, and, so far, I haven't noticed more frequent breakouts, but the lotion feels much more slimy to me than it used to. I often wear it without makeup, and in the past, it gave my skin a nice matte look that I liked very much. The latest bottle makes my skin look way too shiny! And I notice that when I wear it under my mineral makeup, the makeup seems to cake in spots of my face unless I make a special effort to blot up any extra lotion.I imagine I'll continue to use this product, but I don't plan to recommend it to my friends the way I used to. I am also using much less which means it'll probably be a long time before I'll use up this bottle. In the past, with daily use, I used about one bottle every 9 months to a year, but I'm now applying about half as much lotion as I did in the past."

Well made. If you are looking for something to heat your feet when the snow flies, you can't go wrong with these! Can also be put in the freezer to cool feet during the summer . . ."

25759,2,"After using the Sex Bomb Bath Bomb for the first time, I must admit I was greatly disappointed! The pink water was kind of attractive, and it was quite fun watching the ball explode into a fizzing fountain, but the smell was similar to musty, heavy talc powder."" As I bathed, I tried to convince myself that the smell wasn't that bad until my seven year old son opened the door and stopped in mid sentence to ask, ""what's that aweful smell?"" I couldn't deny the obvious and pulled the drain plug. As I watched my efforts go down the drain, I noticed my squeezed out washcloth draped over the side of the tub with a memorable tinge of bright pink to remind myself not to buy the Sex Bomb again. The bathroom smelled for close to a week, it was terribly strong! I definitely would not buy another one of this scent but did since order the Butterball Bath Bomb and it's fabulously rich in moisture, like taking a bath in lotion and very faint butter cream smell!"

60267,2,"If you want a natural nail tint, that looks like color of the real nail bed, this is the shade for you. It is not as pink as the photo; it's more cream. Really sheer, just perfect for a french manicure. Not for me though, I like my colors more saturated, even with a Fnch.ManiFollow up April 30, 2011: I went to the local salon, and found this shade, and guess what? this shade is not sheer. It is semi opaque. A few coats will give solid coverage. And the color is a creamy soft pink; not like the one I purchased on Amazon. Don't know what is up with the distributor; not the seller. Very disapointed, 'cause I have had to return 3 nail lacquers thus far; and without return shipping reimbursement.Update: The seller did reimburse one way shipping charges."
89274,2,"First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!Please don't buy, it's fake."
200674,0,I had used this a few years ago and was simply amazed by it. Unfortunately it's not the same anymore. It's way too orange...and this is supposed to be the nude. Also way messier than it used to be. I nearly destroyed a hotel bathroom with this. The biggest reason I got this was b/c of how amazing it camouflaged cellulite and spider veins...it's just didn't do that anymore unless you seriously coat it....disappointing...it's just not the same.

62325,0,"Bought this to use on my should length hair. The pick doesn't stay in the handle, but I didn't really care about that. I think the barrel is a little small for the length of my hair, I should have gone with the 2 1/8"" barrel. It does make my hair shiny and bouncy. My only real complaint is the handle. It's a very grippy material which is great for my fingers to hold onto, but my hair grips onto it too! I often have to untangle my hair from around the handle. I think I would prefer a more slippery handle so that my hair would just slide off. So I'm still looking for the perfect round brush."

I ordered it from Amazon and when I got the bottle open and sprayed it on, it smelled the same, but seemed to be a watered-down version of the one I tested. I paid $56+ for this perfume and may send it back. Too bad, it smelled great on the boat!!!"
31660,0,"I loved this hairbrush until it started breaking a ton of hair. I love the handle and brush size but when I used it to dry my hair straight, my hair would get wrapped around the rubber grip parts on the handle and break. My hair is pretty strong but when I pull it around the brush while drying, it tended to get wrapped in the grooves where the rubber is on the handle. This would have been a great hairbrush if only the handle would be plain wood and didn't have the crevices in the brush where hair can get caught. I now have a ton of small little hairs on my head that stand up. I have changed hairbrushes and am waiting for those hairs to grow out. If you are not using this brush for straightening your hair, then you might have better luck with it. It's a great brush but just didn't work for me."

It's also pearlescent, which was kind of a surprise to me. I love the color though, along with China Glaze in general. It dries SUPER FAST.The product is very hard to work with, however. Since it's a white based color, it's hard to get it to apply evenly. It's also very matte, so if you want it to be shiny, use a top coat."

My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair, I've never processed it, I never even get split ends, so that's not even an issue here.

I still have some peeling, but I'm hoping that will go away with continued use.Warning: This is a strenghther and is NOT designed for those who like to wear pretty polish every day.

205055,0,"This is Babor's version of La Mer, with a price tag to match ($400). It claims to be magically brewed like La Mer, with their Sea-Telligent complex,(cut and pasted claims): ""A high-energy ingredient obtained from a deep-sea microorganism. Thanks to its anti-oxidative properties, it protects the skin thoroughly against the effects of stress. Because the extract is both thermoactive and UV-activated, it generates heat, which further enhances its effect on the skin.""Well, i received a small jar of this and i swear it transformed my dry, blemished skin overnight into a dewy, glowing complexion. I was so thrilled with the results that i shelled out for the full-size product (my bank account cried), and.... sadly the results i initially saw never came back. In fact, this cream doesn't have **any** quantitative/clinically based claims to back it up--just a fairytale marketing story, some obscure technology, and a hefty sticker price. It's just a rich moisturizer, in my opinion.I found the cream increasingly too heavy for my skin, making it an oily mess before bed---apply sparingly. the richness of this cream also made my pores ""heavy"", prone to milia, and more visible as a result. I would only recommend this cream for mature skins. The wide-mouthed jar is unsanitary and prone to bacteria when you re-dip your fingers. For such a ""high-tech superluxe"" product, it should come in an airless pump system."

This is the third set of baggallini's I have purchased. Unfortunately these don't have the double zipper for locking medications, so we will have to adapt them somehow. Also, the material doesn't seem as strong, so when these wear out, I will probably be looking for another bag. But everyone loves the vibrant colors."
60180,2,"I purchased this because I was looking for a large barrette that would hold thick hair. I had purchased less expensive barrettes in beauty supply stores, but the clasp was usually glued to an &#34;anchor&#34; which was then glued to the decorative piece. Because my hair is so thick, I would usually break the barrettes in the struggle of getting all of my hair in it. The clasp of this barrette appeared to be connected to the decorative piece (rather than an &#34;anchor&#34;), so, I thought it would work better. At $30, I expected the clasp to be of higher quality than the less expensive barrettes. It was not. The clasp on this $30 barrette was exactly the same, poor quality as those on my $5 barrettes. I was deeply disappointed."

32905,0,"I've been using these for about 3 weeks now...not really sure what to think yet. I can see the logic behind them - keep the muscles from activating & there's less reason to crease. However, they recommend you use them overnight - & I wonder how much I'd be wrinkling my forehead while sleeping without them. Also, I don't see how I'd ever get to the point where I wouldn't need to use them every night & it'd just be maintenance. In the morning when I remove them, I do see a difference. But the difference seems incredibly short-term.I will continue to use them for now, but jury is out as to whether I think they work as advertised. Leaning towards no.UPDATE: Stopped using them. They did nothing in the long run."
89155,1,"I bought the T3 featherweight for my wife as a Christmas gift for my wife. She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time. After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3. No such luck. She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes. When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again. She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two. Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature. The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees. Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.The Revlon was much less consistent. Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees. I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair. I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one. Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.Both dryers are very quiet compared to those that my wife has used in the past. The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels. The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side. From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels. These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.The Revlon did push out more air. On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3. On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.Bottom line: The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair. If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3. But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3."

I stepped that up to 5 miles 3 times a week 3 miles the other 2 days. I also, started using the eliptical rider. And I dieted. I used this product in the mornings and evenings.

203800,0,"I had high hopes for this shampoo/conditioner system. In truth, it's not bad. I have to say though, at least for me, it's not great either, and certainly not worth the extra money to buy the Wen product. My hair is mid-back length, and I get frequent compliments on it when I take the time to smooth it out with my flatiron and wear it down. When I don't smooth it out, though, it does tend to look dry and can get frizzy fast. My father used to call it ""poufy,"" if that helps you to get a good mental picture. I bought Wen on a couple of people's recommendations, and I got the kind for extra dry hair -the fig version. I'd have to agree with some of the reviews that comment on the smell of this version. It is pretty much like cherry medicine. While it isn't terrible, it isn't something that will lure the men in, I don't think, and it lingers in your hair until the next time you wash it. The shampoo/conditioner itself isn't bad. It might have made my hair feel marginally softer after I washed it the first time. It didn't actually help it to smooth out any, though, and I was hoping that would happen. After carefully reviewing the product before I bought it, I was hoping I would have some sort of miraculous experience with it like so many others had. I didn't. I didn't have a terrible experience either, but I would have to say that, if you are going to spend the big bucks on this shampoo, buy it from Wen directly so that, if you are like me and `ehh' about it, you can at least send it back for a refund."

Buy it somewhere else for a heck of a lot less money."
204615,2,"I bought a bottle of Home Health Castor oil from my local health foods store about a month ago and it doesn't expire for another TWO YEARS and I was very disappointed to find a large mold cloud forming in the bottom of the bottle (which is a clear bottle so it's very easy to see). I thought because it was cold pressed and the only ingredient is ""Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil"" that it could be stored at room temperature (I haven't read anywhere that it needed to be store in the fridge, no where on the product label either). I've always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine. I guess I would recommend to others to try keeping it in the fridge. I and VERY DISAPPOINTED, MONEY WASTED."
128602,0,"I ordered this on May 3rd assuming is would be recieved by mothers day on May 10th. It didn't even ship until May 12th. I'm not sure why it took so long to ship, but it missed mothers day by almost a whole week by the time it arrived on May 15th. Boo Hoo."
185742,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."

54175,1,"I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle. I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick.I've used this type of pin for years and so I didn't find them difficult to use - but they take a little practice.No pin marks, no fishhook ends, no frizz, no problem!Now I wish they made a set with even bigger rollers! How about 2"", Conair?"
165770,0,"This past summer I spent some time in Nice and bought some rose-scented French soap. I loved the smell and went to the internet to find a perfume that was like that. I read many reviews before I purchased So Magic, and it sounded as if it was just what I wanted....but it wasn't. This perfume is discontinued, and it may be that the perfume is a little old and not quite what it used to be. This is a very sweet scent ( almost cloying) that might be nice on a young girl between 10 and 16, but not for any woman who is looking for a real fragrance. It's my own fault for buying perfume online without smelling it first. I will not do that again."
245518,1,"When I did a search for this, I was shocked to see this price. I was going through my email and linked to Vermont Country Store. They have found a vendor that produce the same oil from the original Nivea and sell it under another name; it's close to $30. Just try a search of skin oil and it will probably come up there.I remember using this years ago, and thought it amazing that it healed scratches overnight from my cat. I had always wondered why they quit making it."
210302,0,"I am not that impressed with it, but I bought it for my wife and she really likes it which is what counts more than my opinion. It doesn't seem to be very strong to me. It seems to be very faint perfume but it also does seem to last a long time."
10697,0,This product is like mascara but presumably with a little more staying power. It is not much larger than mascara either (which I have also tried). I have used it in front at crown of head and it does cover the growing in light roots and at sides also. It goes on easily and lasts a few days. I don't use it often and only to protect my hair from the drying results of doing a complete hair dye of entire head.
207774,1,"I bought this as an afterthought to round out my order, but now that I've had it a while I must say I have found it to be really useful. Instead of fighting with snags and snarls I simply run this wide tooth comb through my hair a few times and after that a regular comb just glides right on through with no problems. I never knew that this type of comb was so handy. Highly recommended if you haven't tried one before."
222392,0,"I was so excited to get my FHI. When it FINALLY arrived this morning, I opened it up, took a shower, and proceeded to put it to use. Just so you know, my hair isn't thick or thin, but somewhere in the middle. You know, average. But it is naturally curly... VERY naturally curly. So anyway, I read the instructions and set it to about 230, thinking I could always lower the temperature if that was too hot.After my hair was blow-dried, I put half of it up and started to gently press the plates on the bottom layer of my hair, and slid them down gently, without tugging or pulling (like the instructions said). And viola! The curl just popped right back at me, same as before.So now what? Well, I did what anyone would've done and moved the temperature up a bit and tried again. This time the curl slightly bounced back, but not like before. So after about ten strokes, the curl was gone and this piece of hair was perfectly straight... but I still had about a whole head of hair to go.Eventually it was all straight as a stick, and I decided I wanted a bit of a flip in the front. My hair is cut in the scene/punk style, so flipping is a must. I took some gel made for this, and put a little on the tips of my hair, then used the straightener to flip the ends... and nothing. As I write this review my hair is straight and a bit lifeless, but straight none the less. I bought this product thinking it could make my hair more flippy and straight, but no. I'm glad I bought it, but it's defiantly not what it claims to be."
75343,0,"Since the packaging looked dubios, I am not sure if this is an original. I am hoping that it is.It sure smells like it. But i was a little disappointed that it was NOT a perfectly packaged box."
177304,2,"I was searching for a ""pure"" lotion without any harsh ingredients and was excited to find this. I was extremely disappointed for a couple of reasons:1. Smells horrible after several minutes, smells like throw up with a hint of fruit..2. Does not work for dry elbows/knees3. Did not make my skin feel smooth or hydrated/I honestly cannot believe I paid 17 dollars for this lotion. It did nothing for my skin and there is not that much product for the money.I want my money back :/"
209157,1,"I have been looking for a more natural alternative to the regular store brands, so decided to try Naturtint, and I am so thrilled I did!The scent is not terrific, but it's not altogether unpleasant, and definitely not as harsh as the usual at home coloring kits (L'Oreal, etc). The product also spread really well and easily throughout my hair. I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and there was plenty of product to cover my hair, as well as some left over.CONS: The gloves are not very high quality and are awkward fitting, but did the job fine.The after conditioner is really runny, and not thick and luxurious as I am accustomed.The final color really exceeded my expectations! It's a beautiful sunny blonde and I love it! Two thumbs up! I will definitely be using Naturtint again. As a matter of fact, I am placing my next order now."
36238,2,"This is not a ""normal"" shampoo, at least in my opinion. It has an oil-like consistency, in a clear, green-tea color. It's hard to hold it in the palms and work up the lather. And this shampoo just doesn't lather well. I really have to add water little by little (even though the hair is already wet) and really take the time to work up the lather. And in the process I've got my hair all tangled with the constant rubbing-motion. Not the best thing to do for long thick hair. However, after rinsing, the hair does become noticeably softer. I still need to apply de-tangling product before I can comb through the hair, but the hair seems moisturized, so I guess the product does its job. No fragrance- just a natural, tree-oil-like smell. I've used it about 5 times so far. Will finish the bottle but probably not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with long hair."
248924,0,"The tube is correctly labeled for LIGHT natural brown. However, the color comes out a very dark brown. If this is truly their idea of light brown, then I would have to order a blond color to get light brown. Ordered two tubes, so am hoping the other tube is an ACTUAL light brown color."
136993,0,"The effects of this product were less-dramatic than what I had hoped. My complexion improved, but did not noticeably lighten. I suspect the most active ingredient at work was the sunscreen. The cream is actually a soft wax that becomes very uncomfortable with long hair and bothersome when perspiring. I tried applying before bed to feel my skin stick to the fabric and leave smears on my pillow. Sweating after application is dangerous, as the oil can get into your eyes. And it can take a few hours to be fully absorbed, leaving the consumer to grapple with these nuisances for a good part of their day, if used as directed. The search continues..."
97521,2,"It smells great when you spray it on the card in a department store, but when you put it on your skin, the light summery smell instantly goes stale and you're left smelling like cheap cologne."
132062,2,"This product is not for everybody. I am black with biracial parents. I have naturally curly, wavy, and straight patterns of hair on my head, but mostly curly. I shampooed and conditioned my hair. Afterwards, I sectioned my hair and used a substantial amount of the leave-in conditioner. I allowed my hair to air dry. This product made my hair look dry and kinky. It also made my hair feel dry, like it was coated with something or had a residue on it. Maybe, I used too much, I don't know? I wish I had not purchased the large bottle. This product has a great smell, but it is not for me! Nevertheless, I guess I will have to keep spending money, until I find what works for me! The next product on my list to try is, Designline's ""Curl Lock""."
85308,1,Smells so good. My face drinks this up. I mist my face after I wash it and then apply moisturiser while it is still damp. My face is ultra soft and dewey since adding this to my regimen.
234930,2,ok so fake mac. first of all mac doesnt come with mirrors on the top of the package. and second if u want tp buy maac get it off maccosmetics.com and the reviews that say it is amazing. they r lame bc they dnt kno this is fake seriously its obvious. i woodnt buy this because u dont kno what it is made out of. so get it of their actual online store or go to a store. or counter
75735,1,this is my favorite scent and i was looking here in amazon the cheapest one and i found it. its 3.4ml and its like 40% sale! it stays long and i always get compliment from my workmates.. smells freaking good so sexy smelling!
166435,0,"I bought this scent in a sample box from Sephora. It has a very strong undertone that reminds me of bug spray in the 70's (""OFF!"", I think). I noticed that several of my perfume samples have the very same fragrance note so it must be popular now (it might be the patchouli or sandalwood??? although I usually like those). Whatever the note, it is a very strong spicy/woody smell that doesn't work with my chemistry or my nose. I only used a very small touch of the stuff since it was new & I didn't know how strong it would be. I didn't like it much in the bottle but I must say that when I first applied the scent I loved the initial dry-down which was very soft & powdery. But then that woodiness was RIGHT THERE & just too strong."
96890,2,I purchased this as an exact replacement. The first use was extremely disappointing. It is about half as potent and doesn't smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty. I had my wife also smell the difference between the bottles. She laughed and said they were not even close. I don't believe these are real.
48939,2,"When the product came it was a few days until I opened the package. When I opened the bottle, there was literally no scent. I had already thrown out the packing slip and did not bother with a return. I have used the product many times over the years, but will not order it again. I presumed it had been on the shelf far to long.Thank you"
183339,0,"I absolutely love the color of this polish! I usually use OPI nail polish and have noticed a big difference between the quality of this polish and OPI. The OPI polish goes on much more thin and smooth. This applied thick and goopy. Also, it started to chip after only a few days of wear. I can go a full week with OPI polish with only slight wear to the tips of my nails. Overall, I love the color, but wish I would have gotten OPI instead of China Glaze."

What items you shipped.Then you sent me a photo of another perfume. The perfume bottle was just pink.I am disappointed, but ... There was no way. Because I do not live in the United States.I often will use Amazon. But I felt the first time. Overseas purchase / delivery problems.I do not send return. Because the time / money must be wasted. I will not use again. Amazon.I am very disappointing and unpleasant, and is not happy."
211874,1,"When I first heard about this brush, it interested me because I love my Sonicare toothbrush & I think Oprah knows a good product when she sees it. I also thought it was a ridiculous price, particularly when I read some of the reviews on here. I've had average skin my whole life, but once I hit 50, it started going downhill. I had more breakouts than I've ever had & my usual products were not effective. I didn't think my skin looked good at all - I'd have weird breakouts that didn't look like anything I'd had in the past. I figured it was worth trying this brush & I'm so glad I did. It felt great on my skin from the first time I used it. My skin feels smoother & cleaner. I've only used it for a couple of weeks but already I see a difference. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who's over 50 & noticing some of the problems I mentioned."
182814,0,Bought this item due to all the rave reviews it got.While it is not the usual drugstore clipper that you get for a few bucks this is a good quality clipper that blows the competition away BUT the opening is rather small which makes it impossible to cut toenails.Mine are not unusually thick so i am a bit disappointed in this clipper's performance.Don't get me wrong these are quality clippers that did a fantastic job on my fingernails but not for the purpose i bought them for thus the 3 star review..
110452,1,"Stella McCartney's ""Stella"" Parfum spray was an absolute hit with my wife. She loves it. What a wonderful fragrance!!! You can't go wrong with this one fellas!!!!"
129675,2,I bought these rollers yesterday and they are terrible. I plan on returning them. They do not stay up in my my wife's hair. They give you these flimsy plastic clips that don't work. Wt would probably work on women who don't have thick hair. She wanted to do her hair nice for a day out and ended up having to use a curling iron and running a bit late due to all the lost time she put in to trying to use these rollers. Next time I will spend more more for a better product.
17550,1,"I was skeptical about this product before trying it. I couldn't imagine such an inexpensive product could produce such good results. My hair is a challenge. I have very long, naturally curly hair, and it's very dry and temperamental. When I opened the bottle of Aussie Moist, I was greeted with a pleasant smell, which reminded me of cherries. I found the product lathered quite well, and rinsed clean, without the feeling of leftover """"gunk."""" I recommend this product if you have dry or over-processed hair."
66809,2,"Can't commend on the item purchased as 2 bottles of different cologne was wrongly sent to Malaysia where I live. What was more unpleasant was the level of customer service accorded by Sams OnLine throughout the 2 months to address the matter. Yes, 2 months to communicate and to work out items wrongly sent by them. I was prepared to mail back the wrong items by paying overseas postage first in exchange for the correct items. Which meant that my total purchase costs will increase. When I suggested the revised product be of a higher value to compensate for cost of returned postage, I was asked to limit the revised product to USD30 each which means that they value the postage as USD8 (the original product paid was USD26). The overseas postage is definitely more than USD8 unless it's by boat. For all the inconvenience caused by Sam Online's careless staff, I had to pay more. Their level of customer service is definitely below average. The irony is that their automated email reply mentioned they value customer patronage and comments and they will get back to you soonest possible. All lip service only."
120236,1,I use this shampoo when I have dyed my hair.This shampoo is transparent pale gold color. It suds well. It does not have an offensive smell. (I have tried some other brands of shampoo and given up on them because I could not stand the scent.) It is gentle and contains fewer ingredients than many similar products. It is good for people with sensitive skin.It leaves hair feeling clean without too dry brittleness.I sometimes used this with the Sorbie Riche Conditioner which I also recommend.

135474,2,I was hoping due to some of the reviews that this product would have been more effective. It didn't do a thing. I only used it twice and haven't used it again. I have used many plumpers and this one just isn't effective :-(

246210,2,"This Oscar de la Renta perfume is a fake. I have used Oscar for many years. This fragrance does not last an hour, not even a hint of it. Doesn't smell the same either.

154863,2,"I see they have changed what was originally advertized. The original item stated ...Ceramic, Black and Purple, which was the style my wife loved.

194359,1,"I bought this b/c I as looking for a quiet hairdryer that would not make my ears ring when I shut it off. My hairdresser recommended this one. Not only is it super quiet - my ears don't ring and it doesn't wake up everyone in the house - the Bio Ionic gives my hair super shine and leave it soft, not flyaway. This is important b/c I have fine, limp hair and if it is too soft, I can't style it - but this is just the right softness that gave me lots of shine and bounce, but enough body to style my hair nicely. As long as these dryers on the market, this is my hair dryer of choice."

244821,0,"I bought this thinking it would help with keratosis pilaris on my upper arms, but I didn't seen an improvement. I faithfully applied morning and night for three weeks without seeing a difference, and gave up. Perhaps if I had gone longer it would help, but I was kind of over it. It's a great everyday lotion though - not greasy, nice and light without a heavy scent. I just wanted it to clear up my skin and it didn't, so my instant gratification self was disappointed. But it's worked for other people, so don't give up!"
159641,2,"Purchased this serum to replace my Estee Lauder Idealist that costs over forty dollars for the equivalent size. The first problem is the smell. I had purchased Olay's quench lotion before and hated the smell, never imaging they would use the same sent for the face. The second problem is the texture - it just felt like thin lotion and when it dried, it felt itchy. I didn't even try using it on my face because when I put it on my hand and smelled it, I knew I would not be able to tolerate that fragrance all over my face. I ended up washing my hands within 15 minutes. I guess I'll have to pay for the good stuff."

170901,0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."
247991,0,"I bought this shea butter a while ago, after reading all the good reviews, and knowing that shea butter is great for your skin!I wanted to like this cream more, but I just don't care for it too much.... because 1st, it's as hard as a rock! Especially when it's a little colder2nd, it feels soooooooooooo greasy, it's the most greasy cream I have ever used! And thus, it takes FOREVER to absorb.I still give it 3 stars, because I don't hate it, and I'm still using it. It does hydrate your skin well, I mostly put it on my legs, thighs, butt, and elbows. And plus, when I ocaasionally put it on my face, it hydrates my face too! And doesn't give me any problems, like pimple breakouts or anything bad!I recently did a little more homework, and bought some other shea butter creams, which are not 100% shea butter but nonetheless all natural ingredients, for better and faster absorption, from Nature's Shea Butter."
144058,1,"When I was pregnant with my son, I had the WORST hormonal acne...which led to a few acne scars and very uneven skin tone. I use this twice/day (morning and night) and I swear in as little as 2 days I saw a difference in my skin's tone-way more even, my pores are smaller, and it's even cleared up what small bit of acne I had left from pregnancy. The only thing that's a con for me is it smells weird-almost like plastic? Weird is the best word I've got...it's not overpowering and I don't even notice it once my make up is on-but I don't care about the slight smell because it's working!!!! Very pleased! I've been through countless expensive and cheap acne scar fading ""remedies"" and this is the best by far! Get the three pack though...as one tube is pretty small and won't last extremely long."

181550,0,"I originally wrote a great review on this product but after getting a professional manicure and having my nails chip literally hours after has changed my mind!! I'm very disappointed and I have never had this happen, even with no name brand polishes I buy from the 99cent store. The only other option I can think of to have the polish stay on longer is to do a glue manicure...I'm going to try it and update. If the glue manicure doesn't work then this polish is useless to me!! It's very unfortunate because I bought 3 beautiful colors!"
85692,0,"This didn't altogether work for us like it did for so many of the reviews that I read before purchasing it. My son is very persistent and stubborn so when we are met with behavior that needs changing it is always difficult to find the solution. It somewhat deterred him, mostly because of the idea of it I think, but I had to reapply it daily and two weeks into the whole process he is still biting his fingers and nails albeit not quite as often as prior to our using Mavala. I think that it would work on other kids who are not as willful."
209326,1,"I started to use Natural Instincts instead of permanent dyes because I was scared a permanent dye would mess up my hair after it's been dyed/re-dyed/highlighted for 10 yrs. I read good reviews about this and picked up a box at Whole Foods for $16. I was hesitant that an organic/natural hair dye using vegetable and such would come out some weird color and didn't really think it would have any staying power... but this dye was a surprise. The color is rich and deep. Before dying I had dark blonde/golden hair and after using this product you can still see golden undertones but the hair is definitely brown now. I would not classify this as what people usually consider ""dark blonde"", it is definitely a brownish color but it has no red hues in my hair. My hair felt nice after dying too-not too dry.The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is at $16/box this is about twice the price as what I normally buy and the color on the box is misleading so you don't know exactly what you're purchasing until you experiment with several boxes. I know most hair coloring kits don't look on the box just like what they will in your hair, but if you see this box in person you will see what I mean. The top of the box where it shows a sample of the hair color-is just a weird color and completely off. This product would be much more successful with better marketing because the actual dye is great... but without reading good reviews I would have never purchased this.Using Natural Instincts (as well as other at home color kits) I had plenty of dye left over after covering my long hair (well below the shoulders) but with Naturtint I could barely cover my hair with one box... just to warn people with thicker or longer hair. I'll be sticking with this dye, it looks natural and although more expensive than other at home kits, it seems to not dry out my hair as much as other dyes. Still cheaper than going to the salon too..."
2472,1,"My husband sniffed out this scent during a layover at the airport on the way to our honeymoon. We didn't buy it, so I had been looking in stores for it ever since. Found it on amazon for a great low price and gave it to him for Xmas. Love this scent...it is manly but not too heavy and smells fresh!"
83831,2,"I've used Kiss My Face Pear Moisture soap for years and love it. Unfortunately, with this order I noticed the bottle has a new label and the product inside is very different. The soap is much runnier and runs right off your hands, unlike the old formula which was nearly as thick as lotion. The scent has changed too - to me it smells more like vinyl than pear. Finally, it is constantly clogging the spout on the Kiss My Face pump dispenser that I refilled.I contacted Kiss My Face and they confirmed that there was a formula change (removed paraben preservatives and synthetic fragrances). No longer the same soap - beware!"

63996,1,"I was concerned about the product when I ordered it, because it was way too cheap compared to its original retail price. However, it turned out that my concern was needless :) The smell lasts long and I am 99.9% sure it is a real Versace product. I love it! It is the best perfume for women during the winter along with Crystalline by Bvlgari and Miracle by Lancome."
160311,0,"I do like this product, however it's not what I ordered or wanted. I wanted the holding mist spray, as indicated, but I got the Serum instead. Two totally different products. The seller blamed Amazon for the online description being inaccurate. I am not thrilled with the seller and won't buy from them again. As they knew about this problem and blamed Amazon and wouldn't send me want I wanted without me having to return the wrong product and pay for returning the item. Poor customer service."
12280,0,"I purchased these slippers for my wife. They came, and the outside is very soft, and the inside is silky/satiny (I apologize for my lack of knowledge in fabrics), but they came size ""medium."" Unfortunately, she needs a larger size, but there was no way to request this in the ordering process. So, I would really recommend the product, but maybe wait until amazon has the choice in size option ready on their website (unless of course the intended wearer is a medium)."

80079,1,Best Deep Conditioning Mask I have purchased. Everyone noticed my hair after I used it. Will be buying more after running out. Love it!!!!!!
103790,0,I wore this when I was a young man. It is considerably cheaper now so I bought some for my young men to try. They seem to like it all right. I don't really care for it much any more. My tastes have changed. Have you smelled the new Gucci line? Nice.
177348,0,"Good brush, perfect diameter.I wish the bristles were slightly softer as it tends to pull the hair sometimes.I'd definitely recommend this product."
149305,0,"I shouldn't shop late at night on Amazon because I end up buying things I don't need like this $20.00 towel. It's a nice towel but no way is it worth the money. I used it this morning and wasn't really getting the ""O wow!! This is some towel!!"" feeling. I also didn't think through the prospect of dropping a hundred bucks cuz I'm gonna need more than one right? I'll reserve this towel for extra special drying moments I guess!! lol."
236174,1,Bought this for my father in law and received it smells great. Great fragrance. With just a spray everyone in the house loved it.
33605,2,I was so let down by the scent! ITs pungent to say the least but does not make my nose do cart wheels at all. At first it smells like Tigress perfume (back in the day-remember?) but then it gets weird on me. Maybe its just my skin but I don't care for this but absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE White Diamonds and Diamonds and Sahphires to piecies! This one bombed as far as Im concerned with the scent. I don't care for Diamonds and Emeralds either because of the strong gardina in it. EWWWWW..........im not a gardina fan in the least.
130960,2,"recieved in timely manner; however, extremely disappointed as this smelled nothing like light blue!! A complete imposter!!Live and learn, will only purchase from a reputable retailer!"
234124,0,"I received this polish for Christmas and was so excited to try it. I pulled the brush out of the bottle and all I saw was a very dark blue polish that had almost no glitter in it. The glitter was all stuck to the sides. I hoped that if I kept shaking the bottle long enough, that the glitter would come off the sides. But, it never worked. The picture is deceiving to me.-YET, it was very smooth when you put it on and dried nicely. It just needs more glitter!"

148556,1,"I purchased this scent when I stumbled across it on Amazon. In the 90's I really wanted this badly, but never got it. I remembered liking it but not what it smelled like. I got it today and instantly was in LOVE!! This is an amazing scent! It smells like nothing popular right now- very clean and beautiful. I was also lucky to get such a great price on the 3.3 oz. bottle:) Love this stuff and is easily my new signature scent."
131347,0,Several of these snapped the first time I tried to use them. The ones that didn't break have held up well. I like there there is no crimper.
161496,0,"Like the size and shape. The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn't work. Didn't last long, otherwise very nice"
118119,1,This is the best strengthener for nails that split and crack. It is easy to use and it works! You can see the difference in only one week.
26296,1,"Amazing for my delicate, fine, dehydrated natural hair. I would definitely recommend. Makes hair soft, shiny and strong. best product I've ever used."
251251,0,"My mom being a hair dresser, Ive used this product for as long as I can remember, I love it. I am now out of state and cant easily get it so I ordered it from amazon.

155185,0,"The product slides off the face before the five minutes are up and I haven't noticed any results, even temporary ones after two weeks of using it the recommended three times per week. The only thing I felt was the sting of wasting over $50."
212729,0,"I thought this advertisement was very misleading. The picture shows a box of multi-colored hair combs, so I was lead to believe that I was receiving a box of about six combs in all the colors mentioned. But I actually only received one comb. It also said in assorted colors, so of course I thought it was more than one. I think they should have clarified that you'll only recieve one comb that Comes in assorted colors. And leave the entire box of combs out of the picture, and just show the combs itself. The comb itself was nice enough, so I don't have a problem with the product. I was looking for combs in bulk, so that really threw me off."
88540,2,"I've loved Jean Nate for years. I was in the mood for an little indulgence, and I bought a bottle. It smells like horse. I am so disappointed that they changed the scent. It used to be so elegant."
209622,1,"This is my alltime favorite scent for men. I introduced it to my husband, and i am SO glad he likes to wear it. When he wears it, I can't stop hugging him. I have a couple of other friends who are guys and say the same thing...whenever they wear DN, the girls love to give extra long hugs, haha."
211788,0,"I was really happy to have an inexpensive way to try the regenerist skin care line. I use some other skin care items by Oil of Olay and have been intrigued by the regenerist products.The set includes the UV defense regenerating lotion, deep hyration regenerating cream, and daily regenerating serum.The tubes include clear instructions for use, including when to use, and in what order to apply the products. The tubes include enough product to get a good idea as to whether or not it will work for you.It has a very nice scent and feels good on the skin.Unfortunately, I did not find great benefits from the product. In all fairness, I have very difficult skin and it has taken a lot of experimentation and a mix of products to come up with a routine that works for me. I was glad I didn't have to buy full bottles in order to try the line."
176254,1,"I have been buying this stuff for years now, but now I can't find it... BRING IT BACK NOW!"
145538,0,Purchased this for someone else and they were not satisfied with the results. It may depend on how much frizz you have. Don't believe it works well on hair that has been damaged from various medications. May work well for anyone who wants to tame down ordinary frizz.
208601,1,our bathroom is always freezing in the morning. I turn my hair dryer on low while I shower and I am warm getting out and dry off fast. holds dryer well and has not fallen over due to weight and my dryer is good size. have it sitting in corner on a 12 inch square box for added height and pole fully extended.
128620,1,"My daughter came to visit, and as she came in the door, I caught a whiff of this marvelous fragrance.....long story short, I had to get &#34;Sunflowers&#34; for myself......I had been without any perfume for quite a while as I couldn't find anything I liked, but that problem is solved......"
56404,0,"I have always purchased this in a Department Store. The cellophane wrapper wasn't sealed in the usual tight way. The perfume doesn't quite have the scent I'm used to, its either old, or lost some of its original good scent in the 'process',since it wasn't sealed the way I'm used to, I have to wonder, I won't order this through Amazon again."
139434,2,I bought the product from the site last month on 5\8\2011. Then I refused the order . After that the money cut from my account and until now I did not get the my money and did not get the order.
217060,0,Works well to give your hair texture but beware to only use a very small amount or you will want to take a shower all over again.
228586,1,"The relaxer I have been using was discontinued so I ordered Revlon Conditioning Creme Relaxer through Amazon. I ordered mild because I have dye in my hair. I had never tried Revlon relaxer before. It was easy to use, not messy. It made my hair very straight and soft, just the way I wanted it. I'm very happy with the results."
123643,0,"This is a review from someone with virgin hair. I have, for the last ten years, done nothing to my hair. I decided to grow it out, get semi annual trims and that's about it. I keep my hair wrapped up to keep it (and the world) safe, when it is not tightly braided. I was getting bored with it and it looked frumpy and putting it up was starting to give me migraines so when I got it cut last week I asked for some layer which I used to have. She took her liberties though and cut way too much off so now I can't do anything with it other than wear it pulled back :( That said, the layers don't show very much. After she did it, she curled it for me and it looked great but as feared, I gave it its first wash today and blew dry it (which I never do, I always air dry) and used this product. I then proceeded with my new curling iron to try and put some curl back in. Until I find the right kind of curlers to set my hair in overnight I knew I would be using heat so I grabbed a bottle of this stuff last night. Hello good deal, I bought mine at Walmart for $3.98. Anyone paying $5 and up got ripped. I applied it to my hair when it was still damp and cannot say I like it much. Perhaps I am used to 100% natural naked hair? Once it dried my hair took on a bit of dullness and film. It smells OK, a little cheap and fruity like pretty much all the hair care stuff on the shelves these days but it's not a bad smell and it doesn't really linger after your hair is done. My hair feels silky but... can I say it has protected it from the blow dryer and iron? Not sure. I do know I am not going to risk damaging otherwise perfectly healthy hair by brutalizing it with this stuff on a regular basis. However, I wanted to at least try to protect it for now until I get a different curling method in gear. I still say if you can avoid using hot irons, blow dryers, etc you're better off. This stuff, if used regularly, and this goes for any leave in product (conditioner included) will eventually cause damage to your hair because it leaves a residue on the hairs that overtime will build up and strip the hair from its natural oils, etc. I generally don't use conditioner on my hair, either. Today I did only because I was attempting to recreate that salon fresh feeling. The residue I felt from my hair after applying this is likely what protects the hair. You're better off also cutting down your washing and allowing your own hair oils to act in the same protective way."
58008,1,I really like the way this soap smells. It's very gentle to my skin too. The only thing is that it can't be left standing in water. It melts rapidly.
59361,2,"I bought this product to help transition into a ""no poo"" routine. It worked well the first day but the second time I washed my hair with it my hair felt so dirty. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like I had gone swimming in a chlorinated pool. It wasn't greasy but it felt grimmy and was completely unmanageable which really doesn't help when you have to go to work. There is a light citrus scent so I am going to try and use it as a body wash and I will update my review if that works out well. Keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't make my skin feel like chlorine."
184370,0,"Got 2B 2 Sexy Mousse (Voluptuous) is a fairly good product. I don't think I will buy it again though. As for volume, I would rate it a 2 on a scale of 1-5, 1 being no volume at all and 5 being the best volume product I've ever used. As for hold, 2 again."
20450,1,"un excelente producto 100% recomendado, el vendedor muy atento y responsable a la hora del envi&oacute; del producto... muchas gracias"
222924,1,My skin looks better and smoother. The product does everything is claims to do. It is a quality product for the price.
218424,1,"This is one of those products that changes your life. It's easy to use, simplifies hair maintenance, makes hair more manageable, and over time, thicker (really!). I wouldn't be without it now. Recommend it without reservation."
6864,2,"I purchased this back in Aug '08 from Amazon and I have finally gotten around to writing a review and it is definitely positive. This replaced my old Vidal Sassoon which had lasted years but the screen got loose and caught in the fan and it was done. I searched and finally settled on this. I couldn't believe that it actually DID dry my hair faster like the other reviews had said, and also without feeling like my hair is frying and, remarkably, it does feel quite soft compared to my old dryer. My hair is medium to long and extremely thick (fine hair but a lot of it) so it still is amazing how fast this dries my hair- &lt;/= 5 minutes. I never thought I'd care about that cold blast shot but it has come so handy as I do use hot rollers quite often. This is also the quietest hair dryer I've ever had. A lower softer rumble from my old one. I loved this hair dryer so much, when I saw the same model on sale at a local drug store chain later that year, I bought one for our family's weekend place. That's when I noticed a HUGE difference. The second one I bought was very loud, and sounded like it was working too hard. I called the manufacturer and they couldn't explain it. That's when my husband and I looked at both and noticed that the one I bought from Amazon had 4 FAN BLADES and the one I bought from the drug store had 7 FAN BLADES. The customer service rep said that isn't the reason why it sounded so bad but my husband and I were convinced and my husband is an engineer. So, I went back to the drug store and found one out of the bunch that had the 4 FAN BLADES. Voila! It works as wonderfully as the first one I bought. So, my advice is:Be sure to get the one with 4 FAN BLADES. I don't know how you'd do that with Amazon, though. I strongly feel there is a remarkable difference in loudness and performance. This is an excellent hair dryer with the 4 fan blades. It's still going strong over two years later with daily use. The second one I bought isn't used as often but is in same excellent condition.UPDATE 1/8/11- thumbs down!It seems I jinxed myself writing the above glowing review. My hairdryer is slowly dying. Its GFI plug kept tripping a couple of days and now my dryer is running on a low speed while on the high switch, the low switch is barely running at all. Still have heat, hair is still drying but obviously I need a new dryer. I just read a recent review on here that says she experienced the same problem, but within a matter of 2 months. My dryer got a little over 2 years. It was a great dryer but now if it is as claimed by the other reviewer that this is a common problem of it tripping and motor dying, I cannot really give a good review considering my old Vidal Sassoon lasted many years, if not for the loosened fan screen getting caught in the blades and ruining it."
238984,1,Great bargain for a wonderful product! My son loves this cologne and this price was great! Love it!
241594,2,"Love Mederma. Love it. I'm one of those people who gets bug bites out the wazoo and Mederma helps scars heal. So, when one of my beautiful daughters needed stitches on her forehead after falling down in the grocery store (don't ask), I bought the kids Mederma. Um... no. So here's the deal. It looks like purple jelly. It says it dries clear. I put it on her forehead/face. It stayed purple. So basically it made an already ugly looking scar look a hundred times worse because now instead of being just a scar, it also now had a big purple blob of jelly on it. It made her feel self conscious so I finally stopped putting it on. But I was annoyed I had spent so much money on it.Bottom line - get the adult version and put it on your children. Same stuff, just not purple.Good luck!"
30738,0,"I really didn't think I would.. However, the staying power is garbage. It dries down & the scent lasts for a little while, but not great for my body chemistry.It is very sweet, & girly.. I smell cotton candy, sugar, and vanilla mostly.I do absolutely love the scent though & will continue to finish the bottle & see how I feel afterwards.I may need to layer it with something, looking for the perfect combo! Lol.The price is fair as well!"
144872,1,I have been using this product for 4 years. I use the body spray as a deoderant and along with the cologne spray the fragrence stays for many hours. At the end of my busy day I still have people comment on the soft fragrence as I pass by. Definately recommend this product along with the cologne for anyone who wishes a soft pleasent lingering fragrence. LEW
168415,0,"Bought this as Clinique doesn't give me allergies. However, it doesn't fully cover my blemishes. I rarely use the corrector now, but still am a loyal fan of Clinique."
245271,1,"I am of Russian and Germany decent, so I am very white and have super bad skin. Every scar I get stays red for years and they never get better. I used Mederma after my first operation the scars weren't horrible but they were enough to make me stop wearing a two piece bathing suit. My friend gave me a tube of Mederma for my birthday in January and by July my scars were even with my skin tone. So for my second operation that happen this October (stupid gallbladder)I got another tube so I won't have to miss beach season. It doesn't work super quick and the scars don't go away but it does take the noticeably out. I used about 7 tubes to make my first set of scars. This time I don't know but I'm one week down and the scars look better already."
6317,2,"The heat level is fine, but the highest wind or blowing speed feels like medium/light. As a male with medium-length hair, I don't see how someone could recommend this particular product (compared to the 10 other options out there at c. $20) to anyone with longer-than-short hair."
154418,0,"I like the product but it did not serve that well the intended use. I bought it for my travel and while it is lighter than conventional cotton towels and is smaller when packed, it had a major drawback. It does not dry too quickly. Especially if it if gets completely wet, then it takes more than overnight to dry. But it is true that usually by just one drying it does not get completely wet. However, it has a very nice feel and even though not for traveling I plan to use it just as my regular towel.Thus, for my next trip, I will get a towel that might not be as good feel but dries much quicker. Second, I will get something that is about half of this size as I felt that even though it is light, I am still carrying more than I have to."
37976,0,"Warning: This is a mature scent. As a college guy, I bought this because of all the rave reviews (I was desperate for a new cologne). The scent is definitely something I would never wear. I'm considering just passing it along to my father."
65738,2,"I loved the perfume in the dept. store but for some reason it smelled off, straight away right out of the bottle. The EDT did not smell like the origianl at the department store. I will try to give this away to some one as it is a none returnable item.. As well as the bottle had glue on the top and on the bottle, very dissapointed."
3588,1,"This is by far my favorite fragance. I receive comments all the time, wondering what it is and how light and pleasant the fragrance is. It is very subtle and that's why I like it--the perfume doesnt enter the room before you do!! My husband and sons really like it for that same reason and the fact it is so clean smelling. Try it!!"
148958,0,"I am not going to say that this is not a good product given the positive reviews but it definitely is not a good product for me. I was so excited to get this and try it as I am always looking for a good 'anti aging' skin cream and the reviews sounded great with a product that was very affordable to boot.Within a couple of days my pretty much clear (and I am 51) complexion was just a mess. I not only broke out but had a strange blotchiness that never seemed to go away. I started using the cream again as I have it here but only on my neck. Too bad though.So my 3 star rating is not so much for the product but for what I experienced it myself using it. All aside, the item arrived quickly and it is always a breeze ordering from here."
154884,0,"Before I review this product, I just want to make a comment about wattage first. I have a Conair hot air brush which is 300 watts. This Revlon hot air brush is 500 watts. I don't care how good a product is, 500 watts will NOT dry hair (at least in this lifetime), nor should you expect it to! I use an 1800 watt dryer to dry my hair (I flip it upside down) and with my fine hair, it takes about a minute to get it almost dry. I then use the hot air brush to finish my hair, as if I was using a curling iron. I love the result! Now, that being said...I got this Revlon hot air brush to replace my Conair hot air brush. My Conair is not ceramic, and it has hard plastic bristles. Some of the bristles have broken off and I don't want it to damage my hair. So, I thought I'd give this hot air brush a try.Two major problems with this hot air brush are deal breakers for me. I don't like the design. The brush part just slides into the dryer portion with no locking mechanism. It's a flimsy plastic which tells me over time it will melt, distort or break, which is probably what's causing the brush to fall out. Also, with my fine hair, I ended up with a static electricity mess, I would assume due to the nylon bristles.I gave this a 3 star rating because, other than the design, I think for those with thicker hair, it probably will do a great job. It's just not for me."
14285,0,"I bought this based on the many reviews. It does sting a little when first applied. Sitting in front of a fan like one reviewer did, does help. The ""itching"" is a little bothersome. But if I get busy with something else and get distracted, it is tolerable. I am 56, fair skinned, freckled with oily skin, large pores on my nose and at least 5 small hypertrophic sebaceous bumps, left side of my face. I heeded the other reviewers caution regarding time. Two minutes to start. I started using it 2-3 weeks ago, at least twice a week. Now, I can leave it on for 15 minutes until it is completely soaked in and don't even notice it. I really don't notice any difference except my skin feels ""tighter"" after I wash it off. Still oily later on. I might get a pink flush after I put it on, but I am very fair and have some roscea on my cheeks and chin.I will continue to use it until gone and then make a final decision on whether it has helped pore size, sun spots, fine wrinkles. I am thinking maybe next time a strength of 30%? We will see."
69714,0,Isn't any better than Olay that I can tell after three weeks use. Not worth $37.00.
112172,1,"This is a really nice product. I decided to give it a try as a moisturizer for my dry skin during the winter months. I have acne prone skin and wanted something that wasn't going to really clog my pores. So far so good. I have decently oily skin to begin with and this tends to help keep that under control somewhat. I have also used it for burns and it really helps my skin. However, you must know that this product does not have a gel-like substance that people are used to from store bought aloe vera. This is liquid and should be refrigerated after opened. Plus it feels nice and cool when applied. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for organic aloe; this is as close as it gets next to the real thing."
137745,1,when i took these out of the box i was shocked. it looks scary... i have never seen a toenail clipper with this weird design... i thought it was gonna cut too much because of it. but it worked extremely well. it does its job quite well :-)
10081,0,"I used the LIGHT COOL BROWN number 14. I would say it is more of a Dark Brown. I have a fair complexion so this looks really BAD on me.It colored my gray, but my hair has this un-natural look. It looks like I have a cheap halloween wig on my head. I dyed my hair and its turning the color of the brass fixtures in my bathroom, and I wanted to use a cool tone to balance the RED, so it wouldn't look so brassy. EVERYTHING I use turns my hair red. I am not going to fight it any longer and just go to the salon and have them color my hair Auburn.With this product I would start with the lighter colors and experiment that way. I would use it again just a lighter color. Don't use the color refresh btw."
91623,2,This perfumes doesnt smells anything...i am so disappointed with this one. I had thoght its good brand to wear...:(:(:(..I would not recommend this to anyone...I am sorry.
158133,0,"If you are good with your hands, it helps a litte bit. It does not entangle my fine hair, but the curls come up quite lose, and do not last long."
88117,1,"It's the only thing I have found for my hair that cleans it, nourishes it, and doesn't weigh it down. I actually have shiny curls."
53971,0,The best thing about these rollers is that you can buy them jumbo sized. Others I've purchased only had three or four large rollers. They heat up well also.The downside is that it's difficult to get the hair on the roller itself (and keep it on while trying to roll it up) and the pins that keep them on get hot themselves from the heat of the roller and aren't the greatest at keeping attached.
87159,0,"It makes scalp feel fresh but makes hair really stiff. The same brand shampoo made hair stiff as well, and after applying the conditioner it became stiffer. It might be better for oily hair."
60154,2,I had no way to check the ingredient list before purchase. I will be giving this product away and will not purchase this again. I use other Schwarkopf products successfully and would recommend them such as the non-ammonia Essensity color developer and hair colors.
61496,0,Billy Jealousy Cashmere Coat has a nice peppermint smell and leaves your head tingling after use. The quantity needed for daily use seems a little high and the price is a bit more than I personally care to pay for a quality conditioner.
184111,2,like a crayola very thick and chalk like finish. It looks good from far but far frome good needs several layers to even look halfway descent. maby it'll look better on you buy and try it but dont say I didn't tell you so.(:
59135,1,"I've used Dr. Bronners Castile Soap for years and I bought a larger size on Amazon recently. Generally I don't have time to order ahead of time so I go the local Whole foods and spend almost 10 dollars for the 8oz. This is a steal and totally worth it for the price to size ratio. The scent does smell of almond, though you do not smell of it after showering. It washes off very easily and I feel pretty clean every time I use it. I don't use those sponge or puff things, I'm a guy I use my hands as if it were a bar of soap."
168629,0,"The tube is correctly labeled for LIGHT natural brown. However, the color comes out a very dark brown. If this is truly their idea of light brown, then I would have to order a blond color to get light brown. Ordered two tubes, so am hoping the other tube is an ACTUAL light brown color."
193670,1,"I have been using Kiss My Face products for years and Jump Start is one of my favorites. It is a very light face wash that lathers gently while cleansing and clarifying your skin. There are things like lemongrass, lavender and tea tree oil that leave your skin stimulated, cleansed and refreshed. The exfoliant in it is very light so you won't feel like you're scraping your skin off at all, but you will definitely see the difference and the glow after the first use. I really like the fact that it's an organic product that is not tested on animals...that makes my conscience feel good!"
205133,0,"I purchased this because a friend had raved to me about how great it was, but I'm not that impressed. Honestly, I notice little difference from my cheapy ceramic flat iron I got for 15 bucks.. I would go for the chi if you want a good one-shrugs-"
156766,0,"I do like the nail polish but the color is SO metallic it ends up looking a bit grey. The formula is also very very thin, but I like it. I prefer it to something to thick. the coats will dry fast so nothing to worry about. its a nice color, I just wish it was more black rather than grey. A good buy. I would recommend it, but not for a black nail polish. maybe for a dark metallic grey."
153264,1,I've used this product for about one year now. I love it! My skin no longer gets those break outs. I use it every morning and again in the evening. It leaves my skin clean without dry spots. I also use a moisturizer on winter days but I don't need it in summer months. Anyone looking for a refreshing clean feeling product. Try this!
163487,1,"This is a great simple, cheap, no frills lotion. I used to spend money on more pricey bath/body products, but this works just as well for FAR, FAR less. It leaves my skin soft, not greasy, doesn't clog up my pores, is easy on my sensitive and dry skin, and both my husband and I love the smell. I will not spend more any more. Recommended."
97371,2,"I've been wearing Escape for about 17 years. I live in a small city and only Elder Beerman sold it. However, they no longer carry the product but said I could get it online for half the cost. They were right. It looks like the same Escape I bought at the store (except the box color seemed a bit off on the shade) but the fragrance doesn't last at all. I used to be able to smell it all day long and even into the evening. With this stuff, I can't smell it an hour later. Consequently, I don't think this Escape is the real thing. I will be heading out of town to buy it in a store now."
245825,0,"This product left my hands too slippery for me to use it during the day. So I used it only at night, and my hands were much softer and smoother when I awoke. During the day I used a different product. """"Just a dab"""" was correct -- not much was required to do the job. Initially, I didn't like the feeling that my hands were coated with something, but this sensation didn't last long. I'd recommend it for use as a night hand cream. I need something during the day that isn't so slippery."
118198,2,This is a waste of money. Basically nothing more than paper with glue on it. It's terrible and doesn't work. Do you want to wear tape on your face to bed? Ugh...don't think so
96255,1,"I totally disagree with the first reviewer of this product. Of course it will slow down when you apply too much pressure, and Thank God! Who wants to file away too much skin creating a problem? It's a safety feature! The disks work great. I was a little skeptical seeing that they were not what I was used to (sandpaper) but upon applying them to the use they were intended was pleasantly surprised. No more ""summer heels"", and no more dry looking tootsies. And the disks don't wear out!!! The other utensiles are perfect for getting rid of that problematic ""office pencil callous"" one finds on the resting finger. But, again, no pressure! This is for gentle, spa-like treatments that are not meant to cause damage for over-use.Bottom line, I bought it because I had other products from Homedics and was pleased. Knew they had a great reputation. Buy it - You'll Like It!!"
152164,0,"I love the Bare Minerels and wanted a case to carry my Mineral Veil everywhere... I think the case is a little bit too bulky and the brush too small for all over face use, so i still use my Kabuki brush, the case is empty and you must filled with your favourite Bare Mineral product..."
245885,1,I have used this product consistently for about 4 months. My acne is much better (this was the only change to my lifestyle) with only hormonal breakouts once a month. Even those are better. My skin is also much more supple and softer.
16606,1,"It does have a strong soapy note, with a light powdery scent. You will smell very clean and fresh.This could easily be a unisex fragrance but it's nothing that would make a man feel awkward wearing it."
120782,2,"This is simply a regular brush, it does not help with tangles at all. For a real tangle friendly brush get this one... The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (you don't have to use it in the shower obviously) - this works on all 3 of my kids - all agree that it does not hurt and one has straight, medium length thick hair, one has super long, curly hair and the other had thinner long hair."
125437,2,"While the mirror works as advertised, be aware that it is listed as stainless steel. It's not stainless steel, it's plastic with a stainless finish!"
145985,2,We were happy with this blow dryer until it totally broke one day after six months of regular use. Warranty requires YOU to pay shipping AND give them $10 to ship it back to you. Might as well buy a new one. Disappointing product unless you want a 6 month disposable.
76778,0,"Not too crazy about it;the scent is okay. I like the shape of the bottle, but its Probably my least favorite of the Calvin Klein Line. Three words....Spicy, woodsy and very strong."
1191,0,"I have no complaints about the showerhead, but after about two weeks the cheap plastic piece that holds the shower head just broke off. If I had known how cheaply made some of the parts were I probably would have gotten something more expensive. If you are handy and know about parts though you could probably just be prepared and buy a nicer bracket and use this just fine.one update, new market naturals does have nice and efficient customer service. I contacted them just hoping to find out how to get another bracket and they immediately said they would ship one without asking for a receipt or anything and said they would add me to their warranty list without having to send anything in"
160899,0,"Hi guys! Well, my sister warned me but I was in need of a cheap flat iron and needed it quick. So, it straightens well of course your first time, but then the ceramic starts to peel as if it was just a ""coat"" of it instead of fully ceramic which if you have natural hair like me it wouldnt be a good thing because it damages your hair, but of course if you're just looking for something quick then this is the way to go!"
196828,2,"My husband got me this iron for Christmas. It worked about 2 times, after it failed to turn on, I contacted CHI...I had only had it 1 month. They do not honor the warranty for any internet purchases including AMAZON.Needless to say I was quite shocked and upset. Amazon is replacing it, but I fear I have no warrenty going forward. I don't recommend this item at all.Buy another brand!!!"
33884,2,"People, this thing is pure quackery. There is ZERO objective evidence that it works and the manufacturer has been given a warning by the FDA to prove their claims. See: [...]Like so many junk products like it, people think it works because they WANT it to work so badly they can't be objective about results."
196049,1,I LOVE Demalogica Super Rich. It is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used. It gives my skin a wonderful texture and feeling.
39044,1,The KMS product received does not match the picture. I believe it is in new packaging. All ingredients are the same and it performs like the product in the picture. Arrived on time and in good condition.
90314,0,I bought the product in the fair color and it seems a little too light for my skin. My legs look kind of waxy. Maybe a darker color would be a better choice for me.
86987,1,"I shower twice a day with this stuff. I love it because it has SA in it! I use a loofa and scrub in circles all over my body. I spend an extra min or two on my legs with KP. It makes my body soft and clean.I then soak my skin with Sea Breeze toner (it also have SA).let it airdry, then apply some AHA. I have smooth skin;)"
142292,0,"This is a unusually good price for this type of human hair.It isn't the best quality, and I dyed it to match, my color.The hair is really porus and has a lot of little knots, so the conditioner really made a difference.Premium NOW is a much better quality product than Premium Too (Sensationnel) hair.This normally retails at around $28-30 per pack.All the products that work for taking care of curly hair, will work on this hair.I recommend product to keep this looking natural, and washing it 1x per week."
209121,0,The Dermal Clay Cleanser is just ok. Over dries my skin but I do have sensitive skin. Flakes on my skin after one week of use. Need to use every other day. Speedy shipping service from seller.
89376,0,Was looking for a pencil eyeliner that would work with hooded eyelids. It eventually smudged and did not stay on. It would be ok for those who do not have hooded eyelids.
125857,0,"My daughters and I have very long hair. I really like bamboo products - and after reading reviews for the brush figured I would give this one a try. Aesthetically this brush is quite nice. Unfortunately, however, it really pulled and snagged on both my daughters hair, as well as mine (2 of us have thick hair and 1 has fine hair). I was a bit disappointed because I've been trying to find a good quality full size paddle brush that isn't too ""aggressive"" on the hair. I think the smaller ""paddle"" brush with the boar bristles would have been a far better option but we really needed the full size paddle."
189908,0,"I gave this one a fair shot, despite the smell. It's not bad, just strong and weird. Within two minutes after taking it out of the box, it permeated the entire bathroom. I used it anyway and, honestly, I was a bit glad that it leaves my skin very dry. Tried it for shampoo too, same result."
247889,0,"Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across &#34;Nautica Voyage&#34; on sale at &#34;Amazon&#34;. In a nutshell &#34;Nautica Voyage&#34; is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a cheap date. Smells okay but won't turn any heads......no &#34;wow&#34; factor."
206545,0,"The face wash smelled weird. Ive boughten this from walmart and target many times before, and it smells minty and fresh. But when I got it smelled weird, but I just hold my breathe for 5 secs and use it! other wise its great face wash."
239288,1,On time transaction and very satisfied with the product! Will definitely buy again from this seller soon! Thanks!
26922,0,"I have been having a difficult time finding a good headband for when I workout, most of them are too thin or won't stay in place. This one I wore once and it was already too loose to stay put. Might be ok to wear outside of working out but it just wasn't for me, especially not for the price."
85126,2,"(Purchased 2 bottles, one for my sister & one for myself) I Used this product on a blemish i have on my shoulder & on my right temple. Used it for two weeks, twice a day. Then i used it once a day for the following weeks, it did not notice a change on my blemish. Very disappointed. My sister has brown markings around her armpits. She also used this product twice a day for weeks, there was no change on her brown marks. .......again, very disappointing. I will not use or recommend this product, waste of time & money."
83307,2,"this item does not work for genetic dark circles.. save your money! i highly doubt hylexin works either, as it is the generic version of that product and contains many of the same ingredients."
90054,1,"I love EO - small local environmental friendly. And I love this soap. It is gentle enough to use with no reaction on my sensitive skin, still cleans well and the smell is lovely. I have traded out ALL the other hand soaps we have and now use just this to refill our containers in bathrooms and kitchen."
18623,0,"it is very much liquid...lip balm does not stay for long time, however I liked the lipstick and it stay for long time"
164039,0,My order shipped to me very quickly! I was impressed with the timing. I am using this product to stop my hair from shedding. It's only been about a month of me using it consistently and so far so good.
209158,0,"I wouldn't say this product is terrible, but it's not excellent either. It's more average than anything else. I bought it a few times and then started looking for another natural hair coloring method.PROS: Product covers well, it's as easy to apply as any other conventional boxed hair dye, and the color sets quickly.CONS: VERY one dimensional (and because of that it looked like I dyed my hair even though I chose a shade very close to my natural color). Also, it damaged my ends faster (I was surprised at this because henna doesn't damage my ends, but this product did).IMO, if you are looking for a more natural alternative to boxed hair colors, then I'd consider this brand. Being that I'm a dark brunette, it just looked too unnatural and was mildly damaging to my ends, so I'll look for something else."
89351,0,"When I bought it I liked it. It curls great and the straightening was not too bad. You had to hold the end tight to get a good straight but it worked. Then I noticed it was pulling my hair through the sides...ouch! Then eventually the spring broke inside and it would not pop open like it should which made it very difficult to straighten. Needless to say it is in the garbage now. I wish I could find one just like this that did not pull my hair and break, at a reasonable cost. The CHI version of this is around $130.00."
78903,2,"I don't think this product is very effective! I used it a couple of time and all it did was burn my skin. It smells like rubbing alcohol and dries out my skin. It really doesn't help with razor burn, or ingrown hairs. I'm just not impressed and will not buy again!"
1509,0,"It's not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo. It definitely added a bit of shine to my hair, but somehow it's become more tangle-prone since using it. I'd recommend this shampoo used with a de-tangler."
26278,0,I'm kindda in the middle of liking and disliking it. I like it when worn during the day specially during summer. But I wont dare wear it at night. The lemony scent really stand alot.
110985,0,"Thought I was getting the spray rather than the splash. Aside from that, product was as advertised."
32738,2,"I am just so pissed right now because the description is completely wrong. instead of a dark brown color, my hair is now jet BLACK!!!I just spent $100 on bleaching my hair and thanks to this product, i have to spend another 100 to bleach my hair again.."
6199,0,"Even though I really like this product I am very disappointed with the bottle itself. The top of the bottle keeps deterioating on me.The serum evaporates, no matter how much I try to keep the container tight. Unfortunately since the quality of the rubber part is so bad I am wasting my money on this product, because I can not use it!"
222490,1,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I am a real person and this is a real review. I have been using this little facial flex device twice daily for about a month and a half and OMG I can totally see a DIFFERENCE! I am almost 33 and I was beginning to notice facial sagging in my cheeks (the very beginning of jowls). I bought the Carol Maggio exercise DVD (which is great, but totally time consuming) and was looking for something else that took less time to do each day! I stumbled upon this product, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I am totally noticing tone in my face...especially around the mouth and jaw line. It's amazing. Honestly, everyone should get this mouth piece. I do 200 exercises a day morning and night... right after I brush my teeth. It's convenient and it works. Get it."
247146,0,"Three Things:1. Easy to install.2. Broke the mirror the very first thing trying to put it together. Then found out that it would cost half as much as the whole dispenser to replace.3. Wished I had realized that to fill the containers EVERYTHING needs to be removed to refill. The ""door"" swings up to get to the containers so everything on the shelf, the soap dish and the razors need to be taken down. Not a good engineering idea."
218873,1,"It was good service and it got to destination fast and safe, thanks a lot for that, I will count on you in the future"
4809,0,"These velcro rollers give my hair volume, but they have to be clipped on to my head using hair clips. They will not stay in my hair without the clips! However it does give my hair a lot of volume!"
200742,2,"I bought this item because it was advertised next to a Clinique product I have been using with great satisfaction for years. The product is Clinique Moisture-in-Control, which, when I last tried to purchase another, I was told has been discontinued. I liked this product because it is quickly absorbed by my skin, leaving little oily feeling or residue on top of which I had to apply my face powder. The oil-free moisture formula product has none of these virtues. I put it on in the morning and, even an hour later, feel that putting on my powder will deposit moisture on my powder puff when I put on my powder. I don't know if it is possible, but I would be extremely happy if I could recover the money I spent (over $70)."
200249,0,I have used this spray for a couple years. This can I couldn`t get it to spray at all. I was able to change it but with plastic gloves on. it was really hard to do. But will still buy the product. Just hope this doesn`t happen again.
14143,1,"my son's acne is a real problem. Have tried a popular ""by mail"" acne treatment that includes several steps that did not help a bit. This stuff has, at least, improved his condition and lightened some of the redness left by the acne."
149858,0,I had really dry skin so I decided to try the deep conditioning moistuiser to apply to my legs at night after I take a shower. While it may have softened my legs some it makes my legs feel sticky hours after aplying the lotion. I can't get to sleep at night because I can't stand the feeling of the sheets clinging to my legs.
243580,0,"It's a good facial sponge...soft enough for your face, but it just doesn't last long. Too fragile and falls apart/shreds.I do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line."
34969,1,"I was intrigued by the reviews but was having a difficult time selecting the color. I googled & went to the K. Aucoin website and found color matching information more helpful. It is true that you need to practice a few times the right amount product & mix with moisturizer. But when you do get it right (3rd try) it is definitely worth it. I use philosphy skin care & use a bit of the moisturizer + capsules + tiniest bit of this product. I'm very self-conscious about my makeup due to redness, etc. I'm very satisfied with the results, and will purchase again."
87225,0,"I love this shampoo.. this is the second time I order it, it works as it says, it does thicken my hair, and I actually like the scent of it altho it took me some time to get used to it... however the first time I ordered this, it was sent to me in a very bad packaging, the bottle was a bit opened so there was shampoo spilled all over the box where it was I figured it was a one time flaw, but this time as I received it one more time, it is again not properly closed, so the shampoo is poured in the bag where it was included. I suggest you seal the bottles, because this is very annoying."
3901,1,"This is a very special product - cannot be overstated! Not highly promoted but I guess you have to really want something this good to find it. Well, worth the search though."
196074,0,"I have used several colored hair sprays and this one is middle of the pack. It sprays out well and covers well. The color matches good. However, it rubs off easily. Basically you can't touch your head after you've sprayed it on. This is the case just minutes afterwards, or hours. Streaks N Tips rubs off easily too. Graftobian and Adair won't rub off."
50090,0,"This isn't a bad scent, but I don't find it particularly interesting or inspiring. However, this cologne is fairly affordable compared to others, but my experience has been that affordability quite literally comes at a price. This scent barely lasts on me at all (although surely others have had different experiences). The main reason this only gets three stars is that Burberry has no real development throughout as many higher-quality colognes have. It's very much one-note, and continues that way for however long it lasts. The drydown smells the same as the application. It's fine for the office, but it's nothing special."
130632,1,"GREAT POLISH AT A VERY NICE PRICE !!!! OPI has soooo many wonderful colors and this is another winner , it's a bit difficult to see the dynamics of this color on our laptop . But if you are like me you will be very HAPPY when you find this little bottle in the mail .Another great deal through AMAZON !!!! :D"
62836,0,"Removable cover can be washed, although you must fold and push the suction cups through fabric holes to get the cover separated. Tiny nozzle is hard to blow up and is not in a convenient location with respect to the cover opening. Stayed firm for a while, then developed a leak. I'll next be trying a foam pillow and be staying away from inflatables."
77170,1,"This product does a good job of hiding the redness on my nose, but be sure to wear moisturizer under it or it will dry and cake."
95228,2,I HAVE HAD THESE ROLLERS FOR SOME TIME NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF ON THE METAL CLIPS AND AS FAR AS THE LID IT IS VERY INFERIOR AS WELL....ALTHOUGH CONAIR MAKES A GOOD HOT ROLLER THE ENGINEERS FELL SHORT ON THE METAL CLIPS AND LID... THE CLIPS CONDUCT HEAT AND BURN YOUR HEAD AND EARS AND THE LID CRACKS BUT AS FAR AS HOW THEY CURL YOUR HAIR THEY ARE THE BEST. I AM SURE THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE SOME LAWSUITS OVER THIS.
72629,1,"Nice and rich, alittle goes along way with this item. I use a dime size with wet fingers to cut it and make it go on smoother. Lasts longer than I expected too."
164224,1,"After searching many stores in my area for a 1/2 inch brush curling iron, I finally went to the computer and was very pleased to find that I was able to order it through Amazon. The curling iron is of good quality and it works great."
154127,1,I really like the Essie nail polish line. You get a great polish for the price. I rated this color a 4 only because it is a translucent pink and I wanted more coverage of a light pink then a clear pink. If you like a light pink/clear polish look then this is perfect for you.
150900,0,"The smooth fabric of this sleep mask is nice, but I find that it rubs behind my ears and comes loose a lot when I have it tightened as far as it goes."
137702,0,"I felt like this needs to be on the description somewhere, but it's not. The tag on this brush says it's for fine, thin hair. Mine is neither of those. Definitely not for thick hair like mine. It brushes, but you have to push it down hard enough to brush evenly.Also, dust piles up on the brush pretty quickly. I've only had the brush for less than a month and I already had to wash it 4 times because the bristles attract so much dust.Hopefully this is very helpful for those looking for a good quality brush. It's an okay brush, but I probably should've went for another type or brand."
185850,0,bought this for about 20 dollars great cream but extremely small size of a finger!! looks so much bigger but its sort of a rip off i put the cream on has great scent but no difference on my skin . i dont reccomend this for its price and size.
175958,0,"After reading multiple reviews, I carefully selected the product with the Keritin as a highter ingredient (about the seventh) but the bottle came with Keritin way down on the list. Also, the bottles seemed to be filled at a second-market facility because they were overfilled and the neck of the bottle was not clean which made me think they had been re-used or re-filled somehow. I really hope the results for the product itself are not disappointing."
150348,2,"Following my review on the Biotin Thickening Shampoo - I do not care for this product at all. The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4"" away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I'm unsure if that's due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair."
108340,2,"Remmington MS5200 is not worth the money. The thrid pop up mini foil will break. It will break via the vibration and will not close back down in position. Vibrates back up and becomes a lead blade wich is quite uncomfortable. I pulled mine out. Now its a two blade. I had previous Remmington's which worked great with the three blades and a pop up trimmer, but were poorly designed as the trimmer suffered the same result as this crappy pop up foil.. vibration and plastic dont mix.Build a better shaver Remmington"
96353,0,"Not sure if EB5 Toning formula really tones, tightens, and firms. I just thought I would give it a try, again. I'm not saying it doesn't do what it claims to do; I just wish I could see a very visible difference when using this product. But, maybe it is helping more than I think; it is worth a try to form your own opinion. Will I buy this product again? Probably."
146414,2,"I didn't realize when I ordered a month supply that I would have to use Viviscal for six months before seeing results. That would make a large investment of time and money without any guarantee of results. Also, the instructions recommend to take it twice a day, so you have to remember to take it again after dinner. I, for one, sometimes forgets that second pill! Only use if you are prepared to make that commitment. Joyce4"
82433,0,"I was curious as to the product. I tried it. I'll keep trying it. I'm not so sure it is working how I wanted it to. I still end up with some underarm odor towards the end of the day. That might be caused by my change into dirty t-shirts at work. Overall, it is interesting and worth a try."
136111,0,"When the bags are brand new and flat as pancakes, you can almost, almost stretch them to the measurements listed. Decent quality, though."
85040,0,"This brush was a slight disapointment - although I love t3 usually - I just cant say I love this brush. Its big, the handle is nice and it feels awesome when you run it through your hair - but it creates SO much static in my hair that its not even funny!! Im serious, when I go through a section of my hair..and pull the brush away - I HEAR the static in the brush.. creepy. I sprayed it with static cling, it seemed to help - but I wish I could just say that it was amazing all on its own - I guess I will keep searching for my dream... a truly static eliminating brush!"
39374,0,"I bought this blow dryer based on the reviews and am moderately pleased with it. Right away I noticed how heavy this dryer is and the first few times I used it, my hands would slip up and I would accidentally press down the blue button at the top (for cold air). This was going on for a week before I realized that it wasn't the hair dryer going bad but it was my hand hitting the button. I also would not agree that this hair dryer ""blow drys my hair faster"" like some of the other reviews simply because the heat doesn't get hot.. more like luke-warm air (which isn't always a bad thing!). Overall, my most favorite part of this blow dryer is the color- it's beautiful. If you have previously used a heavy blow dryer and don't use really hot air to blow dry your hair then this product would be great for you."
161450,0,"Good dryer for the money, I guess. I too has some trouble with the cord not fully retracting after a very short time owning it. Overall, it did what it was supposed to do, although I didn't notice a huge difference over the job the ""old fashioned"" $10 dryers I used to buy from the drugstore, before they became such complicated and expensive things. This is starting to overheat and not dry properly after about 14 months of light (but daily)use. While I know small appliances aren't made for long term use anymore, think I'll go back to something much simplier to replace it."
45362,2,"I purchased this for my wife. Her is her take on the product: If you've never purchased this product, you're probably satisfied. I've enjoyed the fragrance, Amarige by Givenchy, for many years and previously purchased it through Macy's or other major department stores. Because of the price, I purchased it through Amazon and...what a mistake! It's definitely not the same AND it cannot be returned. Better to pay more and receive the original product."
199474,1,Bought this for my father in law and received it smells great. Great fragrance. With just a spray everyone in the house loved it.
236004,0,I purchased this atomizer after my daughter broke the spray mechanissm off of a bottle of Ralph Lauren Blue. There are several things I really like about it such as: a wide mouth on the glass vial which rests inside the metallic case. It is a good size and the spray itself is not really concentrated but covers a good area. However the glass vial does not stay in the metallic case. It does not screw in and I am afraid that I will lose the case in the not so distant future. It could be that the problem rests only in my particular atomizer but I believe that it is a design flaw. I would purchase it again because of the good qualities I mentioned and it was a good price. Be warned however that the glass vial might be exposed and of course could easily break inside your purse or briefcase.
97013,0,"This is a good cleanser. Smells good, and doesn't take all the oil out of your face. Does not give the squeeky clean feeling, but that it not suppose to be good for your skin. My major complaint is that they store these in cheap plastic bottles. Couldn't they put these in glass bottles that is safe from chemicals leeching into our bodies? The fact is, anything stored in plastic, will have chemicals that can leech into the product if 1. stored in their for long periods of time, 2. if put into hot or frozen temperatures, or if it reacts with the substance inside. There are also different types of plastic that are safer than others, but I am not sure what plastic they use. Irregardless, it's plastic, and more likely contains BPA, a carcinogen. If they would only change their packaging, I would be a happy camper."
82025,0,"I am biracial and my hair is dark brown so I figured it would be easy for the color to take, but it didn't. My hair is only a shade darker which really isn't that much noticeable. No one else could tell. Only I could. It's been about 2 weeks since I used the product and I'm already looking for another."

69444,2,"Background:I used the mix on my overprocessed honey blonde hair with dark ash blonde roots.Results: because I've been using henna powder (pure and mixed) for 3 years or so on and off, I followed my own recipe: mixing the henna powder with 1/2 water, 1/4 strongly brewed chai tea, 1/4 strongly brewed dark coffee, wet set on the hair for 2 hours. The results were ok- the blonde ends turned to a medium golden dark blonde, but the dark ash blonde roots turned a dark reddish chestnut color. This faded in about 6 weeks to a washed out strawberry blonde color which blended decently into my ash blonde roots."
250033,1,You can't go wrong with this classic brush - and it comes in so many different sizes and different hair types
212608,1,"Intensive Moisture Balance is a great moisturizer that really does have a perfect balance in moisture without being greasy. Great for dry, pre-maturely aging or combination skin. After my pregnancy I found that my skin became much more oily and then this product started to cause me to break-out. I then switched to the Active Moist, which is better for oilier skin. I use many of the Dermalogica products and think they are a great skin care line. I recommend the line to anyone looking for skin care products. My least favorite part is the high price, but amazon always has some great sales, making them more affordable."
21554,2,"After reading mostly positive reviews for this product, I had high hopes for it. I have medium-length wavy/curly hair that I brush-straighten on a daily basis, so this sounded great! Unfortunately, it's not so great. It adds a little bit of control, but does nothing to smooth/lusterize/de-frizz my hair...and, to boot, it makes my face break out every time I use it. The only reason I gave this two stars was because the fragrance is pleasant...not flowery (I HATE flowery fragrances), definitely fruity, and not so overpoweringly sweet that I couldn't stand it. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product, especially if your face is sensitive or prone to allergic breakouts."
120306,2,"This company misleads you. The perfume doesn't smell the same. I have been buying Lumiere by Rochas for 17 years and still have a little left. I compared the two and the one from this company does not have the same smell. I even sprayed one on each arm and asked two people if both arms smelled the same, and they said no.(I hadn't told them before hand either). Also the bottle the perfume came in is totally different from the picture on the web site, and the bottle that the real Lumiere comes in (the purple bottle); and the sprayer on both bottles doesn't spray correctly (I had purchased two bottles). I will never purchase anything from them again and I'm going to try and get my money back."
92961,0,"I used this before, a couple of months ago, & it was fine. This time it started burning immediately. My scalp, ears & neck were burning like crazy from the beginning. It did give me the lightness I wanted, but because of the high volume peroxide, it left my hair an extremely light yellow instead of ash. I will now have to use a toner. My hair was already bleached up to a medium light blonde. But I hadn't used anything on it for about 2 weeks prior."
47049,2,"I bought this perform from macys before and it smells very nice, but this one is like i put my money through away it does not smell AT ALL. Do not waste your money with this Fake perform. pay a little bit more and buy it from stores, because this is not an original Versace Bright Crystal."
51297,1,It smells good. It's just right for a young adult! Or young boy! Bought it as christmas presents for my husband's nephews and it's just right
149378,1,I have noticed my hair thinning. I blame it on medications and stress I have been under with chronic sciatica. I decide to try an all natural body and volumizing shampoo. I checked on Amazon and came upon Kiss My Face Bid Body Volumizing Shampoo. I noticed the difference from my first shampoo. My hair seems thicker and has great body and shine. I strongly recommend this product.
243755,2,It probably not a product for me. You see I have the really big type of ance that grow deeper under the skin and this product does not clear it. It does reduce the redness though.
207572,0,"What can I say? I got 20 pieces..but 90% were brands I'd never buy. I guess it was a fair price for what I bought, but I can't say I was happy."
241847,0,"The product description says that the warming pouches are filled with flaxseed. The pair I bought are filled with RICE. Ordinary white rice. I don't know whether it is ""organic"" in the sense that no synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers were used in the growing of the rice - or whether it is just ""organic"" in the sense that rice is made from organic molecules made containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, as I learned in ""organic"" chemistry class. I suspect the latter.30 seconds in the microwave is not enough to warm them. But they do warm up, and they seem to be a better solution to cold feet than the electric booties that leave you tethered to a cord, long after your feet have gotten warm enough.Maybe we should have just made cloth bags full of rice to put into the slippers we already own."
16792,0,"Okay I love the fact that I can now buy great natural products, but c'mon what is with all these natural product becoming so...I don't know? Um... useless. I buy exclusively natural and chemical free cosmetics and I'm finding it harder and harder to find products that are reasonably priced they actually work. This is a RINSE not a wash. It doesn't lather hardly at all, which doesn't bother me as long as it's getting me clean. I don't work in a garage or anything I'm not covered in motor oil or anything like that, I'm just washing off the days dirt. This gel doesn't wash anything off and frankly the smell is...weird. Not sure why someone would think this smelled like honey or mango. It smells like sour bananas. The first time I used it I had to wash off the gel with something else...lol I love Alba and I suggest their products regularly but this one is not great."
50929,0,I love the results of the Caruso Hairsetter. The rollers are a different story. The ends come off as you're setting your hair (very inconvenient)! The sponge on the rollers also starts flaking off after a short time. It seems Caruso could come up with better rollers.
197629,2,i ordered this item forever ago and it still hasnt even been shipped.. i'm considering canceling it and going somewhere else if it doesnt get send soon.. i've been waiting for many weeks!
251582,1,"To begin, I have never in my life reviewed an item - this is my first and the Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Aloe Formula truly deserves one.This product works! And it works well! As a former nail biter (I stopped in August), my nails were so soft and brittle. I have been using this product for about two weeks, and my nails grew. But that's not what astonished me, it's how thick, hard, and strong my nails are. The top layer is unbelievably smooth. When I used to bite my nails, I would peel off the top layers of my nail, but this product has fixed all the damage I've been doing for the past twenty-one years. I no longer have baby soft nails that just wouldn't grow. This product has given me the nails I've envied on other people all my life. They are strong, long, and utterly beautiful. I know this product is the miracle because I had stopped biting my nails for a few months, and even when they grew out they were still damaged, week, and uneven in the layers. In the last two weeks there has been a total transformation of my nails. I am amazed to look at my hands and convince myself that they are indeed mine.I have also been applying this product every chance I get, not the recommended twice a day. I carry it around in my purse or pocket and just apply it whenever I think about it, every chance I get. If you're looking for strong, smooth, long, healthy nails, use this product. It works!"
95269,1,"love my curlers except they gave out after year was up 18 mos - but for almost daily use, that could be a plus."
67198,1,"This detangler is phenomenal. I have tried numerous brand name products, but this is the ONLY detangler that works for me. It can be used on wet or dry hair and all of the knots and tangles just comb right out. I love this product and highly recommend it."
133890,0,"So I use Manic Panic dye a LOT. this was my first ""Amplified"" product, and maybe thats what went wrong but it didn't turn out how I expected. I applied it just like all the other colors I've done, I shower/shampoo my hair, towel dry, apply the entire bottle lol then I cover my head with aluminum foil, like a heat cap, and let it sit there for nearly two hours. THen I rinse with cold water, apply conditioner and don't wash for a few days.Only with this one, it didn't dye my roots (It says not to apply to the roots but I always have and it dyes them) and the color left some faded areas. it looked like I had had it in for a while and had already shampooed a few times with it on the first time.Otherwise, the color is still pretty awesome, I don't HATE it. but It wasn't my best experience with Manic Panic dyes."
46913,1,I bought this cologne for myself and my sister. It is a remarkable fragrance and we both like it very much.
236410,2,I was choosing a light pink and got a taupe color. same name but not at all what I wanted
78885,0,"I don't actually use this stuff, I bought it for my girlfriend, so keep that in mind with my review. I have discussed the product and her experience with it, of course.The product seems to work ok to help reduce ingrown hairs, although it definitely doesn't eliminate them. It seems like you need pretty regular and consistent use to get the best of it. Unfortunately a majority of its composition seems to be alcohol, and the smell and drying nature of this discourages such regular use - at least for some people (I certainly wouldn't want to put it on my face). So it's far from perfect.It would be much better to have a more soothing product. We haven't tried any others out there yet (e.g.Princereigns Ingrown Hair GelorMiN New York Solution2 Razor Bump Rollerball Treatment), but I know there are many that don't rely on alcohol for some of their effect. Her salon gal has also recommended other, less astringent stuff. She'll probably switch to something else as soon as this is gone (or sooner)."
149850,0,The other review for this product is nearly identical to a review this person wrote for Burts Bees eye cream. I seriously doubt the reviewer has ever tried these products...you can tell by how generic the reviews are.
57016,2,"Not that much more absorbent than my regular terry cloth towels. I also wish it was bigger - not great for someone with long hair. One nice feature, there's a loop on the towel so i can hang it on a hook in the bathroom to dry after using it."
71619,2,"I have orange roots. I left the product in for the additional 10 minutes as directed on the box for covering grays. I wish I had rinsed it out after 30 and then maybe my hair would not be reddish brown on top. Before coloring, I had medium/dark brown hair with some grown out highlights and a few grays. Oddly, the roots of my hair, which have not been chemically treated, reacted the worst. The colorant had a brutal chemical odor and I was worried to have it rinsed all over me in the shower. Tomorrow I will be heading to walmart for some Clairol Natural Instincts semi-permanent hair color (brass free, lightest brown)to try to mask all of the brassiness I now have. Not a good experience to say the least!"
118519,0,Product does what it should. It just has way too much perfume for my taste. I've stopped using it because of that.
245187,2,"Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to this product.I got a terrible rash that ended up spreading and making my skin a hot mess. Be careful if you have sensitive skin."
190166,2,"I own more than 50 colognes from the best designers. This one gives me a headache at just one sniff. Very synthetic and annoying on first spray - smells like chemical (rather than high quality cologne). Had bought blindly on the comments. If you think I do not know what I am talking about - let me tell you - I know other colognes that smell almost the same or exactly the same. In fact this smells EXACTLY - yes EXACTLY likeXeryus Rouge for Men by Givenchy 3.3oz 100ml EDT Spray. Dries down to an overtly feminine floral/vanilla base. Extremely dissatisfied. However, since both the colognes are extremely popular, it seems there are people who like this kind fragrances. My suggestion is always buy cologne only after sampling it in person from any store since preferences vary widely. You may love this or hate this. Amazon does not accept returns for fragrances."
200335,2,"Don't buy this garbage. It smells bad and it looks like you are just spray painting your head. It's exactly like spray paint except spray paint stays in one area and this garbage goes everywhere. The spray does not stay on your head too long, even if you apply your own hair spray holder. It is very messy. I had residue all over my face, hands, arms, and anything else around me. It just makes you very dirty and you definitely notice it when you shower it all away. When you tilt your head, tiny fragments of the spray fibers will fall everywhere and makes you look like you have a very bad dandruff problem. If you want to have dirty fingernails and embarass yourself and want to know what it feel like to survive an oil spill, use this product."
117756,0,"I like the idea of a gel and I like the cooling feel. However, for my normal skin, even in the summer when it tends to get oilier and requires a light moisturizer, this is just not enough moisture for my skin...it feels almost drying. I ended up giving it to my BF who has super oily skin and he loves it! I'll probably get more for him when he's out! But not for me."
223809,0,"I love the scent, but....when I put it on to try it, within ten seconds my skin was red and smarting. I don't know what ingredient I am allergic to, but it has to be newish - my grandmother wore this and I tried all her perfumes once. She died quite a while ago, but I still remember that none of her perfumes did this to me back in the early to mid 90s. That's the bad thing - everything now is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, or cheaper, more synthetic crap instead of real oils and extracts. I think Ms. Taylor would be ashamed of what the manufacturers have done to her perfume."
232090,2,"This product smells great, but it's a little too strong on the fruity side. I bought it because I have sensitive skin, which suddenly seemed to get very dry in the t-zone, and the reviews of this cream indicated it worked well for dry, sensitive skin. However, after putting it on in the morning, then applying my makeup, the skin on my nose and surrounding area and forehead were still dry, and you could see the flaking skin. I have since found other web sites which have products without parabens and other skin irritants, and they state that using products with too many fruit acids is hard on sensitive skin. If I had known that, I would never have purchased this product. Wish I could get my money back as I was only able to use it a couple of times!"
250345,2,"I bought this mirror for when I go away and there's not alot of light in a hotel room to apply makeup. I needed something very close with alot of light. I find that although this light is adequate I would have preferred even more light. The different shades of light that are suppose to simulate day, night, etc. also to me aren't accurate. Perhaps this light is adequate for someone else who doesnt require as much light, but for someone who requires a very well lit up area it's just ok."
127579,2,"The detail trimmer is of plastic and the mechanism is not of good quality. It does not serve hte purpose of a detail trimmer. i intend to go for hte Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 Pieces"
119832,0,"I had a Conair YellowBird Pro which is an awesome dryer. I had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack. Thought I would upgrade, and this BlackBird seemed like a good choice.It's not a bad dryer. I'm thankful it is 2000 Watts. But, it doesn't seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I'm still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It's nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless. Next time, I'll make sure that I get the Conair that has the Cool-shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high.Not a bad dryer- does the job, and certainly better that the 1875 Watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore. Consider a different model if airspeed is important to you."
145037,0,"Just like another reviewer, I have enjoyed this scent for years (I'd say for about a decade), and have noticed they changed the formula or are trying to. I used to buy it locally but now it's harder to find, so I order a few months supply at a time wherever I can get a good deal. Some of the last few times I ordered I noticed that, although the basic scent is there, it lost its power and just does not lasts as long. It evaporates in a matter of minutes. One of the things I loved the most about this scent was that, for the price, it lasted ALL day. And I really mean that. I've also had people stopping me in the street asking me what perfume I use, and people that haven't seen me in a while get a flashback when they perceive the scent on me. It is such a unique and beautiful scent, not known by many, so when you make it yours, people recognize you in an instant. They don't have to see you to know you are in the room. Also, it isn't a scent for everybody. It has white flowers base notes, such as gardenia, tuberose and jasmine, and scents like that tend to react with a person's specific skin chemistry, which is why sometimes this type of perfume smells great on the little cardboard in the store, but on you it's just not the same. And this one is powerful... or at least it used to be.About a year and a half ago I received some bottles with the weaker version and thought it might have been just that batch or something. I just don't want to give up this scent, so I ordered more anyway. The next two or three shipments were fine, and now the last two I got are just weak. Just a shadow of what it once was. I went through half a bottle just trying to get the scent fixed to my clothes to see if it would last all day like it used to. I am SOOO disappointed! I have read similar complaints in other sites, and some people suggested switching to Fracas or Sand & Sable, and even one from Kardashian, which are supposed to be similar, but they're not. They are lovely if you like musk and tuberose fragrances, but it is not a substitute. They're in the same family, but they ARE NOT the same. Nothing compares to what New Musk used to smell like, and how long it lasted. PLEASE use the original formula again! What is happening?!?!? The original version deserves 10 starts, the one I got the last time barely deserves 1, so I'm going to rate it at a 3 for now."
114287,0,"12/1/2012 Update:I've been using this for a few weeks now. After I wrote the first review, I started to notice that the cleansing cream smelled like alcohol, and that my skin was more dry than usual. I understand that alcohol is useful to use as a preservative, but it's so drying. I love Aubrey Organics as a company, but I really wish they would use less alcohol in their products, or stop using it altogether.-------------------------I've never had an acne problem, but I occasionally get a few blemishes when I'm stressed out. Recently, that has been ALL THE TIME. I've also been out of my usual beauty/skincare regimen, and my skin has been suffering for it. I bought this cleanser (being a huge fan of Aubrey Organic's shampoos!), and after using it once, my skin looked visibly better. It was less dry, and this cleanser seems to have put an end to my stress breakouts. Thank you Aubrey Organics!!!"
240562,2,I received the other two products that i purchased apart fron this one. Why? Kindly give me feedback. ThanksTeresa
238189,1,"As compared to my previous blow dryer (Revlon), this Conair is more attractive, quieter, and lighter weight with all the same power and features. The only drawback is the shape of the main concentrator attachment, which is too wide for concentrated styling. This is not a problem if you have straight or fine hair, but if you have thick full hair with lots of body, you may need to spend a bit more time ""taming"" the height. Still, I give this appliance a multiple thumbs up."
73050,2,This was smaller than anticipated. It lasted for 1 use then lost both air and suction. This is a very poorly made product. Don't waste your money.
93895,0,"This is my second bottle im using and although it does seem to make the hairs somewhat thicker, its nowhere near whats claimed on the bottle. Bottle claims that ""you will see significant thickening after one use"" but that is too good to be true so use the whole bottle and maybe you'll see some change. My bro was using it as well and he did start to see some fine hair regrow so thats why i bought another bottle. Smells great though so thats a plus :) I use the shampoo and their conditioner every day."

171561,1,"I have used AmLactin 12% Moisturizing Body Cream for at least 2.5 years. I use it every night. I rub a small amount onto the various growths on my body. Mostly they are like warts. What I have found is that over time, this cream will make the growths soften and eventually will fall off without causing any bleeding. If the areas being treated get sensitive during the softening period, I will follow the application with the application of some Vitamin E Cream which reduces sensitiveness. When I first started using this product, you could fine it on drugstore shelves. Today, I have not been able to find it on drugstore shelves. You can find lotion, but it is not effective for the reduction and/or removal of the wart like growths on my skin. So, when I couldn't locate the product at the drug stores or other outlets that carry these kinds of items, I turned to Amazon, entered in the product name (AmLactin Cream) and was immediately connected to a site that could provide the product. I use this product every night."

This was back before I wised up to reading ingredient lists.Fruit of the Earth's ""100% Gel"" is a 100% fraud, chockful of skin irritants, endocrine disruptors, immunotoxins and formaldehyde. Read up on the actual ingredients, then decide if you want to put this stuff on your skin. There are several companies that make pure aloe vera products. But you'll have to read the ingredient lists. Don't believe what it says on the front of the bottle, because there are a lot of companies like Fruit of the Earth who use deceptive labeling to peddle their wares. Read the ingredient lists.

Unlike other people who see extraordinary + effects on their hair, I mostly just love the fragrance of this line which makes my hair smell simply wonderful and makes me happy which makes the high price of kerastase justifiable in my case. Darn if anyone can really explain the power of aromatherapy.Anyway, I snag deals on Amazon whenver I see it. This product was a super great deal at the price I paid for. Shipping was easy with trouble free with the seller as well. No problem with the transaction. But... somehow, the fragrance did not seem to be the same. I don't know why and am disappointed. Did Kerastase change something along the way?"

The colors are rich and they can be applied heavy or light depending on your desired effect. I also like the primer that comes w/it. It rivals my MAC primer that I will never be without. I have the Nolita Navy, Central Park, Brownstone (the perfect neutral), Midtown Merlot (my second fave), and the Tribeca Taupe (only on QVC so far). These are great kits. Perfect way to try her products.Edited to add: I am a black woman, so these colors are wearable for all skintones. Especially the Brownstone."
230415,0,"I purchased Nutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength ""Clean Scent"" in an attempt to control some persistent postpartum dandruff that did not respond to Nizoral or tea tree oil shampoo. While it did not eliminate the dandruff issue, it cut down on the flaking by about 40%. I think different users will experience different levels of effectiveness depending upon the underlying cause of their dandruff, and so others may find it to be a more effective treatment. Regardless, this product has a VERY strong, industrial smell that will linger in your hair for up to 24 hours. My husband has complained loudly about my persistent ""aroma"" and has requested I cease using it for his sake. I question the ""Clean Scent"" in the product description; perhaps the marketer who labeled it considers the smell of diesel to be a ""clean"" and refreshing scent."

I was using an extreme amount of hair spray trying to style my hair. My hair laid flat and was glowing in the dark orange.It was to the point of being ridiculous. I started reading online things to try to get the orange to fade. Nothing worked. I finally came across Malibu products. I thought why not, I've tried everything else. It""s like a miracle! My hair is now a normal color. It bounces and shines.I can style it and it last all day at work without a bunch of hairspray. It's not breaking off. I threw out all of my other shampoos and conditioners. I will never again use another product. LOVE IT! I swear by it. It's a miracle. The bottle says it can be used as a body wash also. I thought I'ld give it a try. Another miracle. No more itchy skin. I also threw out all of my other body washes. A MIRACLE. Thank you Malibu."

Was dissapointed at first smell, since I did not get to test the cologne, this was my own fault. The smell is very powdery, almost feminine, but I can smell the cinnamon and wood as well that masks some of the powdery smell. Overall it's a Good buy for the price but if your like me and like a more masculine smell, I would suggest the Diesel Green for almost the same price."
15522,0,"The Chrome came quickly and in pretty condition. My only complaint was that it claimed to be new, yet the plastic on the outside was missing and the box was banged up. That led me to wonder if it may have been used because it had obviously been opened before. Other then that it seems to be fine. I would more then likely buy from this company again, there prices were by far the best."

231714,2,"This nail polish is a good one. But I was expecting more of it. First of all, I say it is very expensive so I thought it would be a great quality, I wanted it for french nails. but for my suprise it came to my house with a thick consistency. I don't know if all essey nail polish are like this, but this was my first essey nail polish and all I can say is that I prefer buying the inexpensive revlon I have always buyed."

I have very curly hair and I use it to protect my hair when I straighten it. Though it is protecting my hair, it doesn't really enhance the look of my hair or make my hair last longer than any other product would. Next time I will just save my money and buy a simple $5 bottle of something that does the exact same thing."

224507,1,"I bought this originally because I just needed a flat iron, after my mom took mine (long story). Well, it works really good! It works good with dry or wet hair. I don't use it when my hair is wet, mostly because I take showers at night. But when your hair is wet, it might scare you becuase the moisture is let out as steam, and might warm-up your neck. It's NEVER set off a fire alarm (that was one of my main concerns.) It does hurt my fingers, I'm guessing because I might grip it to hard. I have never accidently hit a button. Also, I like how you can adjust the tempature. I stay at 350, mostly because I have thick hair. Btw, I have the 2 inch plates, not 1 inch :)"

53973,0,"I love the idea of hot rollers. Unfortunately I have to return this item for so many reasons.The clip is really annoying.It holds but only tiny section of the hair that make the hall thing messy. So i have to use another clip, It did give my hair big curl even when i brush it the next day my hair was like old Hollywood style.But my hair was a little bit dry, May be this works better for someone with really soft hair. I ordered this b/c I don't want to use flat iron. I used this after blow dry my hair, the first day it was awkward curly and really big 1910 style. I wasn't comfortable. It was like oldies day. Then the next morning after brushing my hair i used it again, This time it was better but it was not enough to walk on the street, so instead of leaving down i did my hair half and half with clip. The 3rd day I didn't use it, I just brushed my hair and letting it down. wow it was beautiful i get all the compliment. I said to myself there is must be a better product out there,I can't wait for 3 days to be my hair that beautiful.So i have to return it. If you are African American or has dry hair I don't recommend this product. It did give my hair body. BTW I didn't feel that much the heat. Maybe that's one of the reason it didn't loosen my hair. what can i say? Lady's see it for yourself ."

107768,1,"I got this as a father's day gift for my papa, it smells really fresh and nice. It is more of a sweet refreshing smell rather than a musky scent. My Dad loves it and wears it anytime he goes out with my momma. Momma lives it as well"
97259,2,"I was disappointed to see that this highly-recommended product for fine hair like mine contains paraben preservatives to which some 10-15% of the population is allergic to some degree. I have a known allergy to them, so can't even try this shampoo. For this reason, I would have given the product *no stars,* but Amazon's lowest rating is 1 star, so I had to settle for that.If you have ever reacted with itching, rash, or hives to old (or cheap, store-brand) sunscreens--most of which have parabens--you will probably have similar problems with this product. Likewise, if you've ever reacted to a product preserved with the chemically-related sulfites that are used to maintain color of dried apricots and other foods, you will probably have trouble, too. That's because those allergic to sulfites usually also have sensitivities to parabens. These people could easily get an itchy rash or break out in hives after use. Beware that children are sensitive to paraben preservatives in even higher numbers than adults.Parabens have caused so many problems in sunscreens over the years that most major brands have reformulated their products without them. (Likewise, sulfites provoke so many reactions--some even fatal--that the US government banned them from being sprayed on restaurant salad bars some 10-15 years ago.) So why does a high-end company like Phyto that charges such a pretty penny for its products have to use cheap parabens instead of a healthier alternative to preserve its otherwise wonderful shampoo?"
83113,1,"I used pharmagel products in facials at my former job and I love the line. I didn't have this one available to me, but took a lot of time studying the different products they had, the ingredients, the way they were used, marketed and the results they were to provide. i have frequent congestion in my skin, i'm only 23, and so I don't have too much of an issue with aging, but holy crap! what an amazing product. I ordered it december twenty seventh and then received it by december thirtieth using standard shipping. I used it immediately and by new years day, have had a drastic change in my skin texture and appearance. I recommend this product for anybody with oily skin, especially if it's aging. Even if it's not aging, you will be extremely pleased. (great for smokers)"

50348,2,I received this product in December as a gift. I just tried it this evening and the unit is broken. It just makes a clicking noise and does not heat up or steam up. I am dissappointed as I have used these Caruso Rollders once before many years ago and I wore the old one out. I am trying to get a hold of the seller to send back for either a new one or refund.I hope everyone else is having luck with their Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter.
140948,1,Can't even explain how much i love this fragrance. My ex girlfriend went wild when we were up close and i would get good complements after a hug. really keeps things interesting when a woman couldn't smell me from afar and with cologne its proper to wear them lightly.

209681,0,I've only been using this for about a month. I just ordered my 2nd jar. The scent is not an issue with me. I normally hate thick creams and the sticky feeling they leave. This one is think to me but dries quickly and doesn't leave the sticky feeling. I have stretch marks from my previous pregnancy so I'm hoping this cream will prevent any new stretch marks. I will follow back up in a few more months.
234847,0,"This powder/foundation is the best color match I have ever found, plus it has great coverage without being too matte/heavy, when applied with a good-quality, natural hair powder brush.I love MAC products, usually, just not this one.I think it contains mineral oil, probably in very high concentration. Every time I use it near my chin and nose, I break out, badly. The rest of my face gets red and itchy, too. I'm apparently allergic to mineral oil, and when I stopped using this makeup, the breakouts stopped, too.I switched to a synthetic brush at first, thinking that the natural animal hair was the problem, but it didn't help. I switched to Bare Minerals, trying to get a more natural product with the same coverage as this makeup offered, but that didn't work, either--that brand is too sheer and the color match just wasn't as good as MAC. Bare Minerals did feel light-weight on my face and was nice for summer, though.I don't like liquid foundations, or I'd try MAC's Studio Fix Liquid version, which I hear is 100% mineral-oil free. the reason I don't like liquid foundations or concealers, is because they're harder to take with you and apply when you're on the go, or can't get in front of a mirror somewhere to see what you're doing. I'm on the run and also travel a lot, and I wanted one thing that was easy to pack, that I can carry with me in a coat pocket or very small purse, that works well, and isn't outrageously expensive.Any suggestions/good alternatives to this one, ladies?"

Aveeno has the most affordable body lotions I have found that have few toxic chemicals. I also like that the pump bottles close easily by turning to the side.

121655,0,"Admittedly, a very nice brush. Unfortunately, it was packed by the seller in a box filled with cut-up paper and some rose buds. The whole thing was drenched with an artificial rose perfume so stinky you could smell it through the closed box. Opening the box made it worse.

214711,0,"I bought this product with skepticism....I watched a video on youtube where beautiful locks were achieved with this product. I bought them hoping to get the same thing, however I was disappointed. The rollers were very heavy and didn't clasp closed well so they did not stay in my hair when rolled. After taking all the rollers out, my curls looked messy and were not great looking. I have great hair for curling and straightening, it's pretty thick and very long, and I thought these rollers would answer my quest for curls...What I do love about this product, is that the storage case is wonderful and keeps everything organized. Also, the rollers get hot enough to curl but stay cool enough as to not burn my fingers-big plus.Maybe I am doing something wrong, or need more practice, but until I can figure out how to do it well, I would not recommend this product."

135900,0,"This stuff makes your hair feel thicker after using it and overall is a good product. I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try."
221502,1,"Demeter Fragrance Library - Gingerbread Cologne Spray 1ozDemeter caught my eye for their astounding selection of unique fragrances. I knew I wanted to get one, but was tied between the Jelly Belly Blueberry Muffin, Caramel, and Gingerbread. Being September and already feeling slightly festive for the autumn and following hollidays, I decided to go with the Gingerbread. Reviews from various sites left me apprehensive about the way it would turn out, some saying the smell wore off within five minutes, others saying that the fragrance was much too spicy and smelled almost like very cumin-y curry. As it turned out, none of those were true. The fragrance was the perfect combination of a cinnamon-y spiciness layered on an appropriate amount of sugary sweetness and an hour later, I'm still getting whiffs of it. I'm so glad this was my first Demeter fragrance as it has boosted my confidence in the line and I cannot WAIT to add more scents to my collection! Thank you, Demeter!"

I don't typically use that much conditioner, but it's necessary with this brand.I would have given it 1 star, but like I said, I like the smell. Everything else sucks.Edit - Oct. 20, 2011After using the conditioner for about two weeks, I noticed another downfall. My hands are very sensitive, and the conditioner actually makes my hands itch. Perhaps I should've known since it's so fragrant that it might irritate my hands. Beware if you have sensitive skin!"

It was poorly finished and i do not think I will be able to polish it and the point is outright dangerous to use. A simple sewing needle touched to some ethanol to prick a whitehead in the center would be safer and more easily managed. You do not prick blackheads which are black but the black color is not dirt as most peope think. The oil becomes black when it is exposed to the air and appears black. You remove these with a tool that has a tiny hole in it and if it will not easily come out do not keep applying pressure. Soften your skin first with a hot wet towel and or a hot shower. After removing any blackheads use something like alcohol to kill any bacteria that could enter the pore you just removed a blackhead from. Then wash your face with a soap like safeguard or Dove and blot dry, Never vigorously rub your facial skin. Some whiteheads are extremely difficult to remove. so do not force it. They seem to be like a white ""cyst"" under your top layer of skin. It goes without saying but here it is anyway. Never squeeze a pimple. All you do is spread the pus deeper into your skin and make a real infection and probably create a scarring effect. To do anything safely you need your own tools and a bottle of isopropal or ethanol (which is difficult to find), and a bag of cotton balls. a fresh bar of mild soap to wash up before and after. A few new clean white hand towels and a few new clean white wash cloths and perhaps a tube of ""Neosporin"" triple antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. Do not loan tools out to anyone. You can use a clam shell eyeglass case to store all your blackhead and whitehead removal tools."

35974,1,"This is the perfect shade of light pink if you like just a hint of color on your nails. This would work well as the topcoat for a french manicure, and it is gorgeous by itself. 2 coats work out great, but I think you could get away with one coat with no problems.I have a few bottles of Zoya polish and they are the most durable I've ever used. Doesn't show ANY chipping or dulling of color, and the color comes off very cleanly when you do want to remove it. It is far worth it to pay a couple bucks more than you'd pay for a drugstore brand and have a product that is far superior."
176444,2,This is a fake. The cap doesn't have the brand name on it as it is supposed to. Don't buy it. I thought I found a great deal and I got what I paid for.

165761,1,"This is truly the goddess of the woods. Cedar, incense, spices, warmth. There is nothing else like this perfume out there. If you love warm, dark, mysterious scents, just buy it and you won't be disappointed. Easier to find in Europe in many forms, but if you see it here, grab it!"
137294,1,"This is my wife's favorite fragrance. Unfortunately, it has become very difficult to find -- it is no longer in the stores I shop. Purchase and delivery were quick and accurate."
137666,1,"Love the color! Although it seems a but more pinky peach in the photograph, it's more of an ""orange cream"" color in person. Still great though, and not cheap at all. Doesn't flake after a day or two like other brands. If you are into the bright pastels, get this color!"

47419,0,I'm out to sea and the water on the ship is very rough on my coarse hair. I used this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo smells nice and doesn't lather as much as i like but it leaves your hair feeling very soft. The conditioner i wasn't a big fan Fekkai Gloss conditioner is a lot better
172061,0,"This is easy to use and does not smell like polish (also dries fast), but it does get sort of cloudy looking on your nails and chips off unattractively."
131700,0,"I have tried many face washes in the past most leave my skin irritated or to oily or to dry, this face wash does not. 3 things I don't like about this face wash 1st. the smell is not my favorite some days the smell bothers me more than others. 2nd it's a little pricey. 3rd. this may just be me but I think it's to runny I end up using more than I need. In closing even though there a few things I dislike about the Mug Cleaner Face Wash I still highly recommend it for people with combination skin."
243797,0,"With slight forehead acne due to combination oily skin I was hoping to find a quick fix.The reviews on this product and the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ingredient made me confident that this would do the trick. However, my forehead has shown slight, if any, improvements over the past week of using the product. On top of this, the actual gel is white and is not something you can put on except for at night before bed without looking like you have a bunch of white stuff on your face.I must note that this product hasn't made my acne any worse and does seem to have dried some of my oily T-zone without over-drying, but that just didn't translate into improvements. I will try another product that goes on clear and shows improvements for me."
154043,1,Before trying this moisturizer I was using one from Clinque (which I hated!)but this one works really great with my combination skin!and my face was super smooth and noticed that my skin looked glowy and its very light!!will definitely buy again! =]

228321,0,"Electronics hobbyists, beware...Read on for more.I know that this is an oldie and a well-loved cologne, but I absolutely could not stand it. Personally, it would be a 1.5 star rating out of 5. But since I will factor in others' opinions about it, I will give it a neutral 3.I'm a 21 year old college student. I'm quite mature (I've been told) for my age, and I think my colognes tend to reflect it. I have only started getting into colognes recently, so I do not have the best nose. I can't tell you what notes are in each colognes, or what the base is of each one. But I do know what smells good to me and what doesn't. I've currently got UR by Usher, Chrome, Burberry London, 1 million, Le Male, Armani Code, and Blvgari Black in my regular rotation/collection.I tried this cologne the other day, and my initial impression was that it was very strong. The alcohol content of this cologne must be much higher than comparable EDTs. The only one I have smelled with more alcohol has been Nautica Blue. The alcohol overpowers the top notes.The dry-down is where it gets interesting. I can swear that Hugo smells exactly like breathing in the saccharin-sweet fumes from using rosin-core 60/40 lead solder while chewing 2-hour-old spearmint gum. It's uncanny. And it's not just my skin type. I let several friends and family members borrow it, and I smelled exactly the same thing on them. Soldering fumes and gum. I did notice that, for my friends and family that have never soldered anything before, they found this scent to be quite pleasant. However, anyone I knew that had soldered anything before or has been around someone else soldering knew the smell without me having to tell them anything.I haven't ruled out the possibility that I got a bad bottle/batch. I will certainly give it another try if I see it in a dept store. So although this is a classic frag, beware. Try it out before you buy it. Especially if you've ever soldered anything before and you didn't enjoy the fumes. It's definitely a unique scent."
83373,0,"Great product. It makes the skin tingle like it should but it doesn't dry the skin out very much. Still, I wished it didn't have so much alcohol in it. It irritates my eyes when I come near it."
113049,1,"I love this hair dryer! I have very thick naturally curly hair, but not the good kind...the kind that looks like I've been playing with electricity. So I have been blowing my hair out straight since high school. This process used to take atleast 30 minutes or more. I am not the kind of person who spends $100 on a beauty product, but once I tried this hair dryer there was no going back. The high wattage is a must! It cuts my drying time into less than 10 minutes. The cool shot button works almost immediately and helps to set hair when using a round metal brush to curl ends. The ultra thin nozzle assures no flyaways, giving a smooth and polished look. When i first started using this hair dryer, my friends thought I had just come from the salon. I havent been to a salon for a blowout since buying this hair dryer. The only reason I rated this product 4 out of 5 stars is that these more expensive hair dryers have the same shelf life as the less expensive ones. They typically only last about a year. But for me, $100 a year it worth it to have beautiful hair year round, and its still cheaper than the beauty salon."
170313,2,"I was looking for the classic Tiffany blue color, when I got it, it was way darker than what it looked like on the internet. Its not a horrible nail polish but it wasn't what I wanted."
159433,1,"I like to buy natural/organic products for every day use and this mascara is one example. It's not a volumizing or thickening mascara so if you want the heavy look and lashed that look like they have a pound on them, this one isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you like the cleaner, more natural look and just want to have pretty elegant lashes, you can't go wrong with Ecco Bella. I have been using this brand for ears and came back to it again. The price is great, the packaging is nice and it has a mirror on one side for easy mascara and lipstick application. It has no heavy scent. It's NOT waterproof. It washes of easily too. I use a bit of water on the finger to dab the lashes and use organic baby shampoo to remove my make up at the sink and in the shower and it works beautifully.I purchased other Ecco Bella products with this item, same positive result."
95500,1,"My husband and I often go for a double appointment to get our hair cut. It was late, right before Christmas and we managed to get an appointment. The hairdresser was in a rush and had fit us in that night out of the kindness of her heart. So, she cut my hair and then let me play around with all the hair products and curling irons while she was cutting my husband's hair. I fell in love with the 1 1/4-inch curling iron she had. I then went looking for one for home use.This has a 1-1/4 inch chrome barrel which is perfect if you want ""body"" and not reallythat much curl.

209992,1,"I received this for Christmas. Really like it. I like that there are all kinds of additional attachments but cannot find refills in stores, must order from Amazon and it takes 4-6 weeks to receive - Too long."
129084,0,I can't tell a huge difference yet w/my under eye area. I've tried almost every product and the jury is still out on this one. Definitely do not put on upper eye area/eye lid. It caused a rash for me.
118685,1,"I have been using the Bare Minerals line for a few years now. First started buying the kits at Ulta, but then discovered that Amazon had better prices plus no tax and even free shipping. Another plus with buying here is that I can choose exactly which products to purchase. Buying the kits at Ulta, I'd get stuck with colors and extra products that would never get used.Mineral veil is an awesome, all-around finishing powder. Use it as the final step to your makeup routine, regardless of what kind of foundation you are wearing ... (or not). Make sure you use a good brush, swirl and tap off the excess powder, then just lightly buff over your entire face and neck. You'll instantly notice more even, flawless skin. This stuff is amazing!Note: If you are layering over a liquid foundation, make sure the foundation is dry before you apply the mineral veil or it will look cakey. Also, a little goes a long way so don't over do it. Buffing should take 20-30 seconds max. I get the best results with the mineral foundation, then layering mineral veil over it."
244170,0,"I like cleansers that are gentle and don't have a bunch of weird chemicals in them, especially salicylic acid (it always makes me break out). This is a simple bar cleanser that does the job, keeps my face clear and healthy. Unfortunately though, it is a little too drying for long term use."
147888,0,I relied on the previous reviewers when i bought this product. But i wasn't that happy with the smell. I guess we all have different taste.I would definitely try it in store before buying....my 2 cents.
202357,1,"There is no miracle cream/oil when it comes to preventing stretchmarks. IT IS GENETIC and if you don't understand that then you will be upset with no matter what you buy. I am 34 weeks along and did not get them. Nor did my Mother with her 4 kids. That's how it works people..... for the most part.Why I did love this stuff is cause it still kept the belly itchies away which any preggo mom will tell you can be torture. And if you give into the scratching you will damage your skin. You need something that will hydrate your skin and do it well and all day. I use this in morning after shower and night before bed. RESIST the urge to scratch and get yourself this oil. I found it on GOOP which is a site that Gwenyth Paltrow runs. She used it during her 2 pregnancy's. Like me she is into a natural lifestyle so I gave it a go. Again, if you are looking for a miracle stretch mark oil, you will be let down unless you are like me and just end up getting them. For what it's worth, having worked in the cosmetic industry I can tell you the best way to prevent stretch marks is a slow and steady weight gain that stays within the suggested range of your doctor. ANYONE will get stretch marks if they get too big. Just how it goes!"
234452,0,"Easy to use & works pretty well--the 2 times we have tried, but one of the colors was pretty dried up so that one didn't work too well. tried adding water & that helped a little. Worked well for the color that wasn't dried out. My daughter had fun."
68824,0,gave them to my granddaughters for Easterthey use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college
32372,0,"This is not the best mascara I've ever used, but nice enough that I will use it up and then probably go back to Clinique. It seemed a bit thick to me, but I didn't have the problems others were having with smudging, flaking, not drying, etc. I did end up using my eyelash comb with it because it did clump. But I can deal. Don't expect a lot from it, I guess is what I'm saying."
78265,2,"This product did not work for me and when I got in touch with the customer service, they are not ready to help.If you really want this product, same model; I suggest that you buy it elsewhere because if you buy it from this seller and by any chance the product is defective, they will NOT accept returns or give you any refund OR EVEN EXCHANGE IT!!!( I was ready to pay a little extra for better quality but I was obviously wrong )It was a complete waste of money and besides, this product is more expensive than many other very good ones in the market!Their policy is ""once you have used it, we do not take it back"" !!!!If the buyer does not try to use it, how will she know if it works fine or not??? !!!! BEWARE!LOL"

34749,0,"Having used and enjoyed many Crabtree and Evelyn products over the years I expected the same of this one but am very disappointed. It isn't moisturizing as you'd expect from a body ""butter"" or cocoa butter or even a good body lotion.The scent is lingering so don't plan on wearing any other fragrances if you've put it on. This is NOT a product I'd ever buy againThe scent is herb(ish) and that part is rather pleasant.It arrived in just a few days as expected - the free shipping was nice."
91617,0,I thought that I was buying perfume for my wife but come to find out i bought cologne for me whoop'smaybe change the picture cause the box does not look like that at all...
235972,1,"I love, love , love this towel, I will buy a dozen. Lathers very well, really good scrub yet gentle. Does the job!!!!!"
156754,0,"In my opinion, as others reviews, it didn't look like an actual mint color (not as pictured). It was more white/chalk color, and I didn't like it... because it wasn't what I expected at all."
248501,1,"When I purchased this mask for the first time, I did not give it so much chances to improve the appearance of my acne-prone skin with a lot of blemishes and scars. However immediately after the first use, I have to admit, I have the best result from acne product I have ever tried since my first zit.It is the only product that keeps me away from terrible breakouts and cystic acne. The mask has also improved tremendously the appearance of my old scars so I don't need to put a lot of make-up on my face. I have already purchased approximately 8 of those masks and I can honestly say my skin is glowing so much since the first use. For acne-prone sufferers as me it is the best of the best product I have ever tried! As other people mentioned, you don't need to use all of the mask (in my opinion, it's just waste of good material:). It usually stays for 10 days if I use it every night so you can save a money too."
36427,1,In stores it usually cost around $20-30 on average( for the exact same product & the same size bottle ).
71666,2,I love the color and have used it before but this product seems very dry on my lips so I have to mix it with lip moisturizer
97906,0,"I gave this product a rating of three, because it weighs my hair down. It has a really nice scent and lathers well, but I prefer the Aubrey Camomile Luxurious Volumizing shampoo, as it gives my hair more body and bounce. I have been using this shampoo as a hand soap, and it does smell nice, but do not like it for a shampoo."
10981,1,"Since I'm a woman, it seems like any time anyone doesn't know what to get me, they resort to body sprays and lotions because all women are supposed to like those, I think. As a result of that, I have years' worth of body sprays sitting around and going bad because I just don't like them. But this one is different.This smells more like the stem and leaves of the tomato plant, so it's an earthy yet refreshing scent. I always get questions and compliments about this spray. I love that it's not flowery or fruity. It's probably not something a super girly-girl would like, but for someone who doesn't like the usual scents, this is perfect."
15506,1,"I first heard about this cologne from a female co-worker. After going to the mall to have a smell (amazing) and jumping online to read some customer reviews, I was sold. To be honest, I was skeptical about ordering online because I had read other reviews of cologne on Amazon stating that the bottle they received was ""stale"" or ""not the same as when [they] smelled in stores."" I'm telling you right now, I had no problems with this one.Some men are going to say this cologne isn't masculine enough and it smells like perfume. It definitely smells like perfume when you smell the bottle, but if you actually spray it on, it smells nothing like it. I usually wear Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche. Just to let you know right now, this scent is the complete opposite. While DN has a strong, masculine spicy seductive tone of smell to it, Chrome has a soft, under the surface, hint of citrus, intoxicating kind of effect. It's like smelling a more gentle side of a man's personality. How sexy can that be? The scent is so soft that you will be tempted to spray more because you think it's not there, but trust me, it's there! This smell works better when I spray on my skin rather than clothing. But then again, you have to find a cologne that works well with your natural scent. For me, this will be number two all-time only behind the Noir. I love getting random whiffs of this cologne throughout the day.Obviously, I tried to stay away from the typical ""LADIES LOVE IT"" kind of review. If you're a male and the only reason why you're buying this cologne is because ""women love it,"" you should definitely find another cologne that works for you. If you're a female looking for a gift or looking for a scent for her man, look no further. I would recommend Chrome and rate it 9/10 overall (10 for smell, 8 for longevity). It's one of the best colognes I've ever worn."
4789,0,"I like the way this Neutrogena Rainbath felt on my skin, but I wasn't very pleased with the scent. I expected it to be more """"citrusy."""" Also, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult to use. It's thinner at the bottom, so it doesn't stand up well in the shower or bathtub. Overall, the product worked well, though, and my skin didn't feel dry after using it."

97947,0,"I really like the smell of this shampoo, but as far as volume I really didn't notice too much of a difference."
122743,0,"I am always looking for a conditioner that will make my dyed and highlighted hair soft and shiny. This is not it. If you live in a dry climate and have processed hair, try Pureology Nanoworks.This is great for my 8 and 10 year olds hair but nothing special for me."
113967,2,"My beautician gave this to me, (she's a friend of mine) and it worked great for a long time, like a year or more. Then all of a sudden it would quit in the middle of a session of hair doing. It was very frustrating to be straigthening my hair and all of a sudden it would quit, leaving me with half undone hair. So I put it in the drawer and started using my Helen of Troy air brush.I think it thought it was overheating. Then I would go back to it and 30 minutes later, if I chose to use it again, it would work for a few minutes again til it apparently was overheating again. I have plenty of other frustration in my life, I surely don't need a defective hair appliance. At least I didn't purchase it."
209301,1,"My hair has been dyed a form of blonde for almost 45 years, either by a stylist or myself (although I can't lie ~ perhaps there have been a few oranges (peroxide, no not me!) and a green here or there from pool use...before Naturtint). Therefore, I feel very confident in praising this product. I told my daughter that if I only have one hair left on my head that I wanted it blonde. She of course said she'd pluck it...oh well!On a more serious note, after returning to a salon and requesting her to be sure she did it ""just like the last time"" so it looked almost like it was streaked with all of the fine variances of color to it and she told me that I create the streaked look, not the stylist as she just uses one color, it's hair type...well let's just say I am no longer spending a fortune to a stylist. So really look at your hair first. And seriously, you mix the two colors, put it on your head, wait 45 minutes, wash it, put the conditioner on for several minutes and you have amazing corn silk hair (that stylists will compliment!). I can't guarantee you will love the color ~ that looks so natural and a gorgeous shade of blonde, because your color will play a heavy role in its outcome, but that from my experience it is an amazing product. My natural hair is fine & a silvery gray or would be if I'd let it alone. I have also used Light Blonde, Golden Blonde and a few others and they are okay but a bit darker than the Honey Blonde (which is my favorite). I've stayed away from anything that inferred beige for fear of a dullness to the appearance. Because my hair is fine I've even used half the bottle so it would last through two uses, but as that requires measuring, and it's not that expensive, why bother, right?Good luck!!"
34947,2,"this product is terrible! if you have naturally curly hair it will leave your hair sticky! the only good thing is the smell! its hard to wash t out , i will not buy again."
51018,1,A good friend of mine uses Monsieur Musk. He smells like a million dollars!At first I thought it would be a very expensive perfume since after many hourshe still smelled great. Nice to know the price was great too...
147063,0,got a sample from my dermatologist - liked it --tried to buy it at walmart - it was 39.00 so i found it here for 20.-- but the sample smelled ok - but this big tube is not pleasant

235954,2,"Most evil product ever produced. Found this under the bathroom sink and while the girlfriend was out thought I would surprise her. Well Men let me tell you do NOT use this on your NAD's. OHH my god, the burning, the pain, I thought I was going to pass out. Jumped into the shower, to remove the napalm from my privates only to find the pain was here to stay. Plus now everything was flaming red and It looked like it had burned off 1/2 the layers of skin. Well I did surprise the girlfriend. When she got home I had everything packed into a gallon of ice cream( only thing I could think of to put out the fire) and was shaking and crying. So I rate this product a 0 but the girlfriend would rate this product as a 10 and for Christmas this year guess what I got from her, A NADS KIT, Her and my family still laugh every time I enter a room. aghhhh"

156834,2,"Make sure you know the real color prior to buying the product. It's a really nice neon and you need a top coat to make it shine. However, the color chipped within a day even with a top coat on. I'd rather just buy a different brand that holds up longer."
93610,1,"Am a fair skinned male that HATES to use sun screen. Result, I have had several basal skin cancers removed - messy. Told my dermatologist how much I hate sun screens and she suggested Color Science. Feels strange using a cosmetic brush, my girls laugh, but it really works! Put it on my nose, face and top of ears, spent 8 hours in the sun working - no burn! It is not greasy and you do not feel it! Amazing stuff! Just hope it continues to work. Would be nice to see it drop in price as well!"

107748,0,"This used to be one of my favorite fragrances. I received it a few weeks ago, and it smells stronger, not the masculine but soft touch it used to have. Now it smells great but more alcoholic. I called Coty NY (manufacturers), and they told me my bottle was manufactured on december 2010, so it's not expired. Just different. Still love the fragrance though."
73581,0,"This is perfect for the ""beach hair"" look. Although I struggle with letting my natural waves free, this product helps create the look. While I would not recommend for a serious job interview, it is perfect for the days you want those natural waves to come out and I have not found anything on the market quite as good for relaxed waves."
158178,1,"I have used the Tangle Free Hot Air Bush on my hair for about 10 years. When I fist started using it I had shoulder length hair. now have short hair and it still works great for styling and lift. I keep 2 0n hand at all times. If you travel a lot, it is compact and weighs less than most hair dryers, and for me it curls better than a curling iron. It comes in 2 different sizes for long or short hair."
116323,1,"I purchase this for my Dad. We appreciate the chance to find it at Amazon because it is long since gone from the stores and no longer in the mainstream. However, it is the perfect scent and gift for him. When it is not a gift and he asks for it, he is always pleased that it arrives at his door, the price is very reasonable, and it is the real product. Good purchase and good experience all around."
112419,0,This soap has a fragrance that is very nice but I found that it is not thick enough for the soap pump.

It is a very nice perfume, I just don't like Orange Blossom and felt a little deceived by the name."

I stopped using the Freeze 24/7, and the comments stopped."
151273,0,"At first I did not mind the smell but it seems like as you get to the bottom of the bottle it starts smelling worse. Also the face wash dried out my skin so now it is flaky and feels rough. It did help me get rid of some(not all) of my pimples, so that is why it gets three stars."
118831,2,i bought the derma wand and returned it without using it because i read a warning from the state of california on the instructions that said that the product could cause cancer and birth defects because of the chemicals it uses....needless to say i wasn't gonna use it! i went to the official derma wand website but i couldn't find any info on that claim or maybe i didn't look hard enough. maybe ill e-mail them one day and see if they tell me anything about that.
225117,0,"I've been using hot rollers for close to 40 years and have never had the trouble I have had with this product.I store my rollers in a drawer and take them out every morning to roll my shoulder length hair. Inevitably when I pick the unit up from the drawer, the plastic top which is not attached, falls off and all the curlers tumble out. Also, the clips seem inadequate for the rollers. The clips are not secure and will work their way off the curler. I have tried using the clips in every position possible because the standard way doesn't hold the roller. However, nothing seems to help and they always pop off one by one to the floor with the roller close behind.The curlers do their job and curl your hair if you have patience with the clips."

228395,1,"This Boss spray has a clean fresh scent that's just wonderful. There's not much more I can say. It's just great -- nothing too overpowering, nothing too flowery. Nice bottle too."
215654,0,"My 6 yr old son has guttate psoriasis. We bought the Body Shops hemp body butter 1st and it worked great at keeping the flair ups and redness down. But the smell is horrible. So the 2nd time we bought this and were super excited because it smelled great. But it lacks the thickness and healing properties of the body shops body butter. It works fantastic for plain old dry skin and hands tho and has a wonderful scent. A sort of banana smell. So I give it 3(ok) for scent and moisturizing, but I believe it doesn't contain enough of the actual hemp healing properties that we were looking for. We will go back to the stinky stuff for that. :)"
237228,1,"Highly recommend, especially if your scalp tends to become irritated when using other shampoo's (like Head & Sholders,) then consider trying Dr. Bonners line of Castile soaps. Very efficient cleaning action, with an assortment of various scents, that doesn't leave my scalp sore and itchy. A very small amount is all that is needed so it is actually very inexpensive over the long run. A 64 oz container will last more than a year. Decanting a smaller amount into a smal spray bottle makes it's use very easy, HOWEVER, don't get it in your eyes, this is NOT a none irritating soap! It is however not as bad as some others I have tried. Many people will want to use a conditioner after using it as a shampoo as well. When using it as a hand soap strongly recommend cutting it with tap water, about 1 part soap to 8 parts water, a little goes a LONG way! The label can be an entertaining diversion as well. The producers of Dr. Bonners soap line make considerable effort to keep thier products as enviornment friendly as possible. Check out the web site for more on that if your interested."
31749,0,"I LOVE the product and the color it produces. It's the nearest to my natural color that I have ever found. The brand seems to be as good for my hair as color can be. I've been using this shade for the past few years. However, I cannot find #415 in the stores at all anymore, hence the online purchase. (In fact I have the feeling the entire ""100% color"" line is gone.)When I received the boxes, the product boxes were in pretty good condition. The crumbles could have been from shipping. What concerned me was that three of the four boxes said ""New Shade"". Hmmmm... how old is this product? What is the shelf life of hair color?My ""bad"" that I did not contact the seller immediately with my concerns but I'm in the middle of starting a new job and moving at the same time.It was well past time to ""do"" my hair so I thought I would try it. The ""creme"" was hardly a creme. It was almost runny. The good news is that it didn't burn my head or hair so I guess it's ok. I am wondering, though about using the other three boxes. I'm just disappointed that the product is so very old and was not said to be."
154438,2,My salon charges an extra dollar for this product and though it may dry the top of the enamel it does not dry through all coats 3 hours after my pedicure I needed to put heels on and my pedicure was ruined. My nails were still wet 3 HOURS later How is that a quick dry.
209729,0,"This mascara is really nice, but it smudges like crazy. It comes on really dark and makes your lashes look so full. For the price, I would expect something that doesn't smudge as bad. Would not buy again."
224444,0,"This straightener was great for about a year. Then one day, I plugged it in and one of the plates stopped working."
83377,1,I like the active ingredients and it works great on cleansing but the scent in the product is way too strong. Very peach and very smelly. I wish they made an unscented version.
230128,2,"I agree with all the one star reviews - this mousse should be placed in the HALL OF SHAME! These awful reviews articulated my feelings after using this awful mousse myself. However, I will make a point to say that literally everything this mousse claims to be is PHONY ADVERTISING! Here's a brief run-down:1. Springing Curls: This name is a joke. At best you get pseudo-curls and they definitely aren't springing (they hang there like limp pieces of spaghetti and look about as appetizing).2. Curl Volumizing: Fat chance. Like I said, there are next to no curls. As for volumizing, I can't phathom how this can be claimed. The hair get clumped together.3. Frizz control: This is laughable. Frizz abounds when using this. And when it's humid out? Forget it - you look like a tumbleweed.4. Medium hold: The overstatement of the millennium! In fact, minimum hold for this mousse would be an overstatement.5. Adds body: The sky will turn green before this happens. If it doesn't volumize, it certainly doesn't add body. The hair has no shape.6.Reduces flyaways: Lies! I've never had more than when I used this.7. Curl enhancing: The biggest lie of them all. This mousse practically reduces curl.There are plenty of other products out there, so I would recommend that you explore them and stay away from this one. It's a disaster from start to finish."
47785,0,just not enough deodorant power; allows &#34;breakthrough&#34; odor. Jason unscented stick works for me without the &#34;breakthrough&#34; the roll-on allows.
173189,1,"The price was perfect and it sold me on this product. From the very first use, I knew I wouldn't want anything else. It isn't greasy or thick. It soaks perfectly into your skin and guess what? No nasty smell that a lot of other sunscreen lotions have."
96403,1,Beautiful! My husband loved it! I looked at his old bag and knew it was time for a new one. This fit the bill!
103885,2,"Pros:Good for blush or bronzorCons:ScratchyDidn't retain shape after washingDoesn't deposit enough foundationThis came in the starter kit I got as a gift and it sucks. I only use it for blush, which it actually distributes well. It distributes the power foundation terribly. The only reason why it got a 2 is because it actually got softer after I washed it so it wasn't nearly as scratchy, but it did lose some of its shape: it became more fanned out and less dense."
246293,0,"I purchased the Jean Nate body lotion for nostalgic reasons. Used to be a dime store product so was disappointed to pay so much for such a small bottle. Plus the lotion appeared to have either been used (there was no ""new seal"" on the opening) or it was on the shelf too long. Bottle wasn't full and it smelled ""sour""."

63830,1,"I have extremely sensitive skin and almost every product makes me breakout. I have been using Cetaphil Sunblock for years now because it was the only one that my skin didn't react to, but it left my skin oily. I tried this when I received a sample and I just loved it and had to buy it right away. This sunscreen I put on after my Shiseido Oil Reducing regimen and it actually acts as a base under my makeup. It leaves my skin with a matte finish and makes my skin less oily. It's thick, but blends in well and doesn't leave a white film on my face. I even go out without any powder on now. It is extremely water proof though and when you sweat at the gym or get wet in the water it looks a little funny because the water just beads up and stays there. Other then that I highly recommend this product. As for the sun protection I usually tan very easily using sunblock, but I do not get any color when I wear this. I use this on my face, neck and chest."
131967,0,"great curl definition, but didn't really help with my frizz. also didn't do much for shine. i do have a tiny afro and maybe once my hair grows and i can better spread the product through my hair, it will give better results."

240579,1,"I have used this nail polish as part of a combination of nail polishes to create the perfect French Manicure that has stopped traffic and gotten compliments galore for over a decade. It's lilac opal, cotton candy, and white opal, put on in that order. One coat each. You add the french manicure white that is used at all salons after you apply the cotton candy and the white opal goes over the whole presentation like a top coat. It's beautiful."

137277,0,"I expect it'll be nicely laying on my face, but it's not.The mask is not really fit, Maybe everyone has their own face shape so it can't please everyone. It also cant absorb enough liquid that i want, and the paper is a little crispy for my face. It says which designed for KOSE lotion(their own lotion), i know that lotion is very thick, so that means it's for thicker lotion style, not thicker toner."
219755,1,I have to say this is a very nice service. I always buy 2 packaeges and they arrive in time and the most important is they arrive safe. I have attention when I ask anything. I think they are very responsable people.About the Rogaine... Is the best. I think it works really. I have two months using it and I have had great results.

73542,0,"I am disappointed that this $8 bar of soap smells no better than any other green soap, and not as good as Irish Spring. I was and am looking for manly smelling soaps that are distinctive, not general in fragrance. I think it is regular overpriced soap. Yes it may last longer but that's only half of what I am looking for. I am currently waiting on a Caswell-Massey sampler and a bar of Mistral Sandalwood... I hope they live up to their pricing."
228832,2,"For quite a while i was dying the bottom longer layers of my hair bright red or pink and the top layers were blond. (I know it sounds weird but it looked really cool) Anyway, I was tired of semi-permanent and i wanted to go forever red but it seems like unnatural hair color doesnt come in permanent! By all means if you can find something affordable to prove me wrong please do! So I finally found this stuff, I got it in fire and...dark red i think and i did the bottom layers dark red and a little further up the fire color which is actually kind of orange and then my blond on top so it made a kind of fireball effect (awesome i know) and it lasted a week and even then there was severe fading. Maybe I misread something on the description but this did not stay on long at all!!! But I do have to say the bottom-est layer was a bit damaged due to bleaching so the color might not have wanted to stay in that hair, but that does not explain why it refused to stay in the layers above that... So my search continues..."
4585,2,"I should have bought in the stores, it's cheaper and I wasn't a fan of the soft black. I like very black, thick lashes so this is only a good fit for someone wanting to do a simple daytime look. The mascara doesn't stay on long and my lashes feel oily with it on."
45186,1,"I started using this lotion when I was a teenager, and it has totally ruined me for any other lotions. They all feel so watery and thin to me. This lotion is incredibly thick, and when you put it on, your hands stay soft for hours. I brought some into my work and all my co-workers were wanting some, it's so decadent! I highly recommend this to anyone!"

244896,1,I have had eczema for 20 years and used so many lotions and creams and changed my soaps and nothing ever worked.. Well finally was told to try this lotion out and in less than a month a gt major results.. My skin is always smooth and looks amazingly healthy.. I can't get enough of this..
25032,1,"I just picked this up today and have been wearing it all day - so far I love it. It's a little bit musky and a little bit fruity, and it also has a sort of powdery scent to it - very light and clean and feminine, which I think will be great to wear to the office."
183668,0,"Well, I love everything about this hair dryer except for the buttons... too difficult to slide back and forth with one hand while drying my hair. If my hands are perfectly dry and have absolutely NO hair product on them, then the buttons are not a problem. Unfortunately, before drying my hair I always put some type of product in it.. a smoothing cream or gel of some sort. Usually I just rub the remaining product into my hands, as those that I use are great for dry skin.... though they take a while to fully absorb, leaving my hands a bit slippery.... which makes it very difficult to slide the buttons back and forth. I have to stop, put my round brush down and use both hands so I can use a fingernail to move the buttons. This might sound petty, but my hair takes forever to dry as it is, and I do like to change the speed and temperature quite a bit while I am drying my hair. Constantly having to put my brush down so I can use my nails to move the buttons is a hassle.I have used many hair dryers over the years, and have never had this particular problem before. As mentioned, I like the benefits of rubbing the excess hair product into the skin on my hands, and would rather not wash it off before drying my hair. Even if I DO wash right away though, since the hair products are usually thick and slippery, it takes several washes to remove all traces so my fingers don't just slide over the buttons. So, for now I try to avoid having to change the dryer settings as much as usual... and when I do, I just have to keep setting my brush down so I can use both hands for the 'moving of the buttons'. I will definitely look for another dryer when it is time to replace this one... of course, now that I am actually wanting to replace a dryer, this one will probably last forever(;"
540,1,"I bought this to help with fungal folliculitus I think I got from the hot tub. I have been using for several months, along with Nizorel anti-fungal shampoo, and now use it as my regular soap when showering.It has a pleasant, but not overpowering, smell and seems to dry my skin out quite well, which is good for me, as I have generally very oily skin and am also prone to spots on my back and shoulders.Definitely worth a try."
195669,1,"I bought this to wear under a ball cap at work. I usually have to wash my ball cap at least once a week here in Phoenix and they end up losing their shape and I have to replace them. This prevents all that, my last new ball cap still looks new after two months. It flat out works!"

128628,1,I got this product this week alongwith the night cream and the eye contour cream and i must say they are working great so far. Its a must try product esp if you have normal/conbimation skin.
111471,2,I was swayed by the great reviews. I wouldn't purchase again. There must be some trick to using it because I can not get as good a shave as with Lab Series or Headslick.
53640,0,I had one of these for 5 years and it was broken on a trip in my luggage which I understand the way they handle our luggage. So that is why I purchase this a month ago.

The pillow is larger than I anticipated, which is wonderful. I have had it for almost four weeks and have noticed no air leaks. It dries fairly quickly. The fabric on the front is soft, not itchy. The suction cups work well enough. If I begine sliding in the bathtub the pillow slides down as well, but that is to be expected; however, the pillow does stay stuck to the tub.I would recommend this product!"

233321,0,"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once. It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years. Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
32132,2,"I purchased this cream as a result of the commercial on television and had great hope it might work. However, it doesn't.

57762,0,I had expected a completely plastic item and was not expecting a cloth cover to the item. I wonder if the description is not complete enough. One of the reviews I read led me to believe it was all plastic. Otherwise it's OK.
19589,0,"Item was right product, in perfect condition, and packaged properly but the coverage doesn't seem to be as good. Possibly B.E. has changed their formula since my last purchase."
63008,2,"I have back pain and foot pain so I thought, after watching the infomercial, that this was just what I needed after hearing all the testimonials. I liked the fact that the heal was low, kind of like the Earth shoe of the 70's. But they neglected to tell you that the arches were not flexible but very hard plastic. The arches hurt like hell and I used the lowest one (they provide three different heights of arches.). Also, it took forever for them to get here. Almost a month! (I ordered from the Walkfit company, not Amazon.) I paid $10 shipping. What were they using? Pony Express? Anyhow, when I called the company about the pain, (I couldn't walk with them more than a few minutes) they told me I would have to get used to them but if I have foot problems I may never get used to them. WHAT??? The infomercial targets people WITH foot problems providing a list of various ailments such as heel spurs etc. Anyhow, I tried again and then the next day and so on for a few weeks. I really wanted them to work for me. Just hurt so bad I had to return them. After returning them, I had to call the company because the refund was also taking forever. When I called them about not receiving my refund (which was two weeks after they got the package according to my tracking number) they said they didn't put the refund through yet. A month later, I still did not receive the refund. I did eventually get the refund but had to call them three times. Crappy way to do business.Anyhow, this is not the product that I expected, especially since they target people who are having problems walking but the product made it even harder to walk and painful."
168823,2,I purchased this product for my daughter and was very disappointed with the results. Her hair grew at the same rate as it normally would. It was a waste of time and money. Taking 10 pills a day and not seeing any results is frustrating.

199240,2,"was very disappointed in this scent. Smells like that old woman's perfume (you know that one that sits right in front of you at church). I couldn't wash it off fast enough. Went back to make sur the box said ""For Men"" and it did. I guess I am one of the few who hated it but definitely test it before buying online and believeing the reviews. Live and learn I guess."
194028,1,I'm a huge Tiffany's fan (and Breakfast at Tiffany's) and just had to have For Audrey. It is a beautiful match to the iconic Tiffany's shade and lasts well on the nail without chipping.
71992,0,I have not tried the item because I am afraid to...the smell is so so strong. I have been wearing lace wigs for 1yr now and I like to try out new tapes and glues. I recently met this guy who was wearing a Tupae(sp?) and his head did smell strong but I figured it was just that brand. Well I guess I stumbled on to the exact brand he uses cause it smell the same. perhaps I have a sensitive sense of smell? (I dont think so) but its so strong it could make me dizzy. I am not one for wasting money but I'm not sure If I can give this one a try (Mmm...maybe at the nape of my neck?) Does anyone know if the smells goes away? WOW. STRONG
236736,2,"My current results with Teamine are scary and upsetting. . .I am praying my skin will recover. I am 52 and had minimal wrinkles but very dark circles under my eyes. After using Teamine for several weeks I noticed my under eye skin was becoming super crepey, saggy, and new deep wrinkles were developing. At first I thought, unfortunately, I was just developing some aging skin and absolutely felt sick about it. But soon it became obvious, NOBODY ages that FAST in a course of THREE weeks!! I could not believe a product that was supposed to do just the OPPOSITE could be causing this, but IT DID! Now I am desperately trying to hydrate my skin, as was suggested in someones else's review, and hoping to at least get it back to how it was before.I had skimmed the negative reviews before purchasing but still wanted to try it because my dermatologist had recommended it. Also, I use the Revision Nectafirm and I really do love that, so I trusted Teamine would be at least safe to try! I feel differently now, Teamine needs to have a warning regarding the damage it can cause.Be warned if you have aging skin!! It may cause crepey, dried out, saggy skin, bags, and deep wrinkles under your eyes. And, unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for my under eye circles. In fact, they started to look ruddy red! If you are young and have tight skin but dark circles, you may be safe. But, in my opinion, Teamine is not worth the risk on aging skin! Good luck, all."

239644,1,"I found this lipstick mentioned on Remodelista. It was a true red, a hard color to find. I was delighted to find it on Amazon and bought it right away. The color will always be in my lipstick collection. My pal from babyhood who now lives in Wisconsin bought it, too."

98200,1,"I tried this cleanser when it first came out and immediately noticed that it is different. After using the first bottle up I have never let my self run out.This product does what it claims, period. I just don't get break outs. It minimizes the look of enlarged pores and it prevents clogged pores from turning into zits because it has two chemicals to sweep out the gunk. My skin feels clean without feeling tight or squeeky. I have normal skin and it doesn't over dry.The texture is something between soapy and creamy with tiny smooth grains in it. It took a little getting used to because it doesn't really foam up, maybe like ten percent. Don't let that confuse you though, most cleansers ADD a chemical who's sole purpose is to foam, because the customer expects it!Also, It has more of a clinical odor than a perfumed scent, but that makes sense since it's technically medicated product to resolve acne. I typically don't want anything extra in products I put on my face anyway, so as far as I'm concerned I'm glad they don't heavily perfume to cover the medicinal scent.A couple people mentioned stinging in the eyes: The packaging does indicate you should not get it in your eyes. This product contains Alpha Hydroxy Acid - any acid would hurt in the eyes! The alpha hydroxy acid is a heavy duty hitter, that's what you are paying for! If I have eyeliner and mascara on, then I use the Neutrogena eye makeup remover first, then wash my face as normal.I love this product so much I will probably use it forever. It is a performance product, it has just what you need to clean out your pores. It's a good daily cleanser that will have people complementing your skin in no time flat."
144653,0,"This product seems to make my skin feel less dry, but I haven't seen much improvement in terms of wrinkles."
183406,1,I love this color. After getting a manicure withSinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon MelonI bought this China Glaze polish to try to replicate it. Even at the nail salon they had to do four coats to get the China Glaze color to look nice. That's a lot of work. The Sinful Colors brand that they used last time only took 3 coats and I kind of liked it better. But either way it's awesome and I get tons of compliments on it!

It doesn't have as much power as my old Rusk Speed Freak, which stopped working for me after a few years of use, but this dryer works well enough. One complaint is that when the concentrator nozzle is on my hair gets caught between the nozzle and the hair dryer. I am happy enough with this product but I don't think I'd buy it again to be honest."
74239,0,I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE WEAK ON SMELL. I USE THIS ALL THE TIME AND THE SCENT IS VERY WEEK. DOES NOT HAVE THE STRONG SCENT AS MY OLD STUFF. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SETTING ON A SHELF A LONG TIME OR GOT TO HOT OR COLD IN STORAGE. THANKS DOUG
