172245,0,"I use this every May and it keeps my hair pretty straight all summer long. If I let it air dry, it's still kind of frizzy, but if I blow it dry and use my large curling iron, it stays straight in humidity- even in drizzle. My bangs don't curl! It's not fun to apply - I have to rinse it so long I run out of hot water and it is smelly, but it is so worth it. Don't put it in your hair right before a special occasion,though - the first week it hangs pretty flat and bodyless. But after a week or two you will love it. I couldn't find it in the stores this year, so I used a regular perm and combed it straight (which I used to do before I discovered the straightener). It didn't turn out nearly as well, so now I have to put up with it for three months and pray that the summer isn't very humid. From now on I will order it online."
141247,2,"This is some of the worst shampoo that I have ever bought for my dreads. Not only is it nearly impossible to get all of the soap out with you shower, but the crap is making me dreads frizzy and causing them to come undone. I have had my dreads for YEARS and never run into something like this. You definitely get what you pay for. I despise the customer service of one of the other company's but it looks like I am going back to them after the bad experience with this garbage. I would give it zero stars but it wont let me."
188222,2,I have used the renac styling brush for years. I ordered two of the new style not realizing they are not the same brush anymore. Both of them are junk. They have about 50-60% heat as the old style. All of the screws come loose after a few uses. Some of them can be tightened back up but come loose again. The company I used to get these from no longer carry them. They have been in business for over 75 years. Hmmmm.... after using these I can only guess why a reputable company won't sell them anymore. Time to start shopping for a new brand.
1824,1,I like very much this color because I can use it everyday because it is easy matchable. It is a very nice and natural color.
148466,2,"This is the second set of Conair hot rollers that I've purchased in two years. The first set barely got warm enough to put a little wave in my hair, and my hair curls fairly easily. Finally giving up, I bought this set, hoping for a different result. They are equally as warm as the first and don't curl. Don't listen to the 5-star results. I did and these are getting returned.What happened to the old days when hot rollers really were ""hot""? Have they cheapened them so much to save money that they no longer work?These are definitely compact and a nice size for travel, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
132066,1,I love this leave- in condish. It makes my 3a/3b curls come to life and go all Shirley Temple. :-)
28468,1,"This is the best paddle brush I have found, and I looked at plenty before deciding on the Marilyn Flatter Me brush. The handle is rubber and provides a terrific grip. The brush is backed with a soft air formed pad which gives when you use it. It is a massage for your head and stimulating to your scalp. Very relaxing ! I also bought the Marilyn cleaning tool and it is super easy to keep my brush clean with that. The tortoise shell back is beautiful. This is a classic brush, I love it, and would recommend it to anyone !"
143727,2,"Cool Water Deep by Davinoff bad quality, no the same as in the pass...old ? expired?"
1603,0,A good reason you should test make-up in person before ordering online: this stuff is pink. Like super pink. I already have a peaches-and-cream complexion so I didn't think it would be too pink for me but it is and it's expensive and now I'm stuck with it but it isn't the miracle product I expected from the gazillions of beauty editors who swear it's the holy grail of concealers. Lesson learned.
143350,0,I bought this hair I was shocked when I got the hair because the color was really off I thought I ordered dark hair but it was kind of reddish or Oberon hope I spelled that right I have never tried color but took a chance it turned out okay but I think the color chart needs to be changed because the picture looks like dark hair and it was totally off wouldn't mind buying more but afraid that it will be the wrong color I did get it really fast so Thanks Amazon 3 stars are for color mistake
177150,1,"This Shower and Bath Gel, has been the one and only cleanser I have used since I was 16. (A long time ago) It will leave your skin so clean, soft and silky! No residue, no fuss, and I just love the fragrance. I bought the smaller size in the beginning, but now since I use it daily, I always order the Mega 40 oz. size. I have never been disappointed with Neutragena Rainbath."
33785,1,"I've been using Joico Daily Conditioning Shampoo (Kerapro), Joico Daily Care Balancing Conditioner (Lite), and Joico Daily Leave-In Detangler (Integrity) for over 20 years. It's hard to find hair care product with out Rosemary and Sage in them, which I'm allergic to. These products leave my very fine, thin hair soft and manageable."

44700,1,"I bought this for my class reunion. I had many people comment on how fresh and light it smells. My husband loves it! It has become my ""go to"" fragrance."

145543,1,"My hair is a bit coarse and definitely frizzy. It's wavy, too, though I wanted to smooth it out, and maybe straighten it. I like that, too. Velcro curlers can do either. For thicker, frizzy hair I think they're my head's best friend (next to conditioner &lt;g>)."

245463,0,"This is the first alcohol-free toner I've ever tried. It smells much better than the alcoholic toner I was using. It's a little sticky though, which I guess is from the aloe. I don't really plan to buy it next time, but it's okay for the price."
168790,2,"I got this gel sometime ago and got around to using it for a wash-n-go. Just going to tell you all some pros/cons before buying it.PROS-Has a topical smell, so if you like that for you hair you'll def. enjoy it-Gives a lighter hold, soft actually-Dries clear-Not much shrinkage-Easy to rinse after usage-Defines the curl without it feeling crusty/hardCONS-After wearing my defined curls for a day and sleeping it the curls were less than defined-Gave my scalp an itchy feeling I did not appreciate-While applying it I noticed a sudsy appearance (I have dark hair, so if your hair is light you may notice it)-PARABEN ALERT!-Didn't lay down my edges had whip out my Eco Styler-6oz for $5 bucks where I can get a tub of Eco 32oz for this priceEnd result my hair had so-so results. It would probably be a good gel if you low on other styling products or wearing a style for a day/night out or til you get around to doing you hair."
53321,2,my skin is oilier with this . I use maybe once a weekSince I can't return it . It leaves my skin smoothBut within an hour or so I touch my face andIt's all greasy. :-( I wish I could get my $$$ back.It was not worth what I paid.
67993,2,"This 'amazon' Body Kouros is totaly FAKE! After 15 minutes,his smell is off! I have original Body Kouros YSL, his smell is working two days on my skin! Very very bad business of 'amazon'! I want my money back!"
134537,2,"...and yet, they are not. To be fair, I don't really have what would be considered thin lips, but they could use a slight pump. So, I use as directed; I promise. Here's what I get: glossy, wet, mildly burning lips with a sweet taste. Plump? Notsomuch. And the guy I kissed with LipFusion had an allergic reaction. Good thing I only kissed him on the lips..."
206589,0,"I have been using Quorum as my cologne since 1972. Over the years I have noticed a slight change in the quality of the cologne, how long it lasts on the skin, etc. To me this last order (the bottle I have opened) is not very good. The perfumed aroma of Quorum is not there. I am going to do some skin and paper tests, and give them a smell. It seems to me, that if a cologne or perfume company changes their recipe on a product they should let the public know. Don't you think so?"
57520,1,"i have used pureology styling lotion for 5 years and cant find a product to compare! i have coarse, dry, color treated, curly hair and alot of products are too creamy n dont have a firm enough hold so my hair just frizzes. It is somewhat sticky (I compare it to sticky water) but for me thats a good thing, provides better hold. However, you only need about a Quarter size amount for medium length hair otherwise you will have hard, crunchy spots. I comb mine through with my fingers rather than scrunch and works awesome!! cant say enough good stuff!"
235198,2,This product gave no clear way to determine the shade. When I ordered it I ordered the darkest shown and it stillwas too light.
102539,0,"This cologne is one of my go-to's. I use it off and on, and cycle with either this or Tommy Hilfiger for men.So, if I use it so often and recommend it, why the 3 stars?Because, as great as the scent is, it only lasts a few hours. I like a cologne scent to last a full 8-hour working day. This is nearly non-existent by lunch.But still, it's one of my favorite scents, and I spray it on twice a day (which means I run out twice as fast...Oh wow...maybe that's the marketing ploy all along.)If you're into a great, but not overbearing scent, give the dVb a try. It's wonderful and subtle. Just be prepared for it to wear off fairly shortly."
69744,0,"Before this , I was using a lightweight, nicely scented ROC facial lotion. I loved putting it on. I loved the light, silky feel and how it quickly absorbed. I loved the bottle it came in. It was small, nice and dispensed a good amount of lotion. It even had sunscreen in it! I decided to try something new and different (maybe better!) So I went with eb5. I think I regret this purchase. The cream is heavy, it doesn't absorb easily. It feels greasy and the jar method of using it can get messy. It doesn't have sunscreen. Well I can't return it because I used the piping method (like you do for decorating a cake) to try and shove this eb5 cream into the ROC bottle. Results were hilarious and overall successful, but it was a greasy mess. Next time I will probably get ROC again. I'm not a huge fan of this cream. It seems like when I wear it, my fiance sneezes a lot. We were in bed together and he got close to my face and started sneezing, complaining that it felt like a phantom traveled up his nose and behind his eyes (LoL). It started happening when I started using this cream. Oh well this forty dollar phantom is here to stay until I use up this overpriced cream. You live and learn........."
214383,1,"I have only used this product 3 times so far, and can already notice a change. My skin is very pale, so any flaws are very noticeable. I had begun getting some mild acne on my chin in the past year, that was leaving behind purple looking marks. This started to really bother me, so I researched possible solutions. I saw several reviews on MaMa lotion on various sites, so I decided to try it out. I admit that at first I was very nervous to put it on. My skin is pretty sensitive, and I was worried that flaking would make it worse. I do admit that it stings (very slightly) for a few seconds, but it is not bad. I am peeling a little bit, but a good moisturizer takes care of that during the day. The places where the skin has peeled off appear to be bright and healthy. The marks on my chin have gone from purple to a light pink. They seem to be fading fast. I am also hoping it will help smooth some of my fine lines, but I don't think I have used it enough yet to see a change in that. I also have freckles, and read that MaMa lotion can help fade those. After a few months of using this product I will come back and let you know!"
215850,2,"I started using lip smackers as a kid, and went back to them recently. My lips were desperately dry and I had purchased a bunch for some goody bags for my nieces, and now I am attempting to un-do the damage. The product smells like gross fake strawberry, not the fresh strawberry scent that many body sprays, perfumes, and hair products contain. Additionally this does not hydrate well at all! It wears off with an hour, and makes my lips peal. This also has a shine, so it is really a lip gloss more than a lip moisturizer or chap stick.Perhaps this is just a fun little gift or novelty pretend make up item for little girls. I know I liked them as a kid, but as an adult it just doesn't cut it."
49393,0,"I bought this cologne after purchasing the aftershave. The aftershave smells distinctly masculine, but not overpoweringly so. With it fading fast, I thought to supplement it with the cologne. Unfortunately, the two do not smell the same. The cologne has a much lighter, citrus / floral scent, with the citrus being the dominant fragrance. It's not bad, and mixes well with the aftershave, which is itself a milder scent, but is more of a unisex fragrance.The bottom line; if you're looking for a copy of the aftershave, pass this one by. If however you're looking for a light, daytime scent that is clean and mild, give this a try as it won't break the bank."
142293,0,"Company shipped product fast. The hair is not real wavey when you wet it. I also tried to dye it a darker color and it did not take very well. Over all the price is good for the hair. I would not buy the hair if it was at its usual sell price. One plus its a 100% human hair, thats why I can understand why it wouldnt dye. Oh well I am happy with my braids :)"
196439,2,"I will not be buying any more flat irons from Amazon. I bought 3 in a 1 month period. spent a total of 300 plus on them. The first one broke in 1 month, the 2nd in 2 weeks. This one did not work from the moment I took it out of the box. I felt so frustrated that I didn't even bother trying to return it, and the warranty is void because it's from amazon."
141318,2,The ball mechanism does not turn easily and the glue hardly sticks. I found thois product disappointing and a waste of money.;
187110,0,I have researched and reviewed loads of great stuff regarding this product. I have seen somewhat diminishing of the cellulite on my backside however but that was only when I was dieting and exercising consistently. Does anyone know if It will work on it's own?
82129,0,"This developer worked okay on my hair, but it didn't make all of my hair completely blonde. I used it with L'Oreal's Quick Blue bleach and left it on for almost two hours. It turned my roots yellow blonde and the rest of my hair a light orange color. I had hair that had been dyed black several times, so having dyed it as much as I did I think it worked fairly well. It mixed good with the Quick Blue into a creamy texture and it took most of the black color out, but if you have black hair and you want blonde hair (not an orange color), I would go with a 40 volume instead, just condition your hair extra to avoid damage."
29911,0,"Only half way through the bottle, I bought to help with keratosis pilaris and acne prevention can't say at this time if it's helped or not no significant difference. One thing I will say is this product smells like car wax or an automotive polish type product - to me anyway - so if your looking for something that has a sexy man scent this ain't it."
106653,0,"It smells really good, but doesn't last me all day. The smell fades fast. not sure if it's just this brand."
38503,1,This is one of the best colognes for daytime use. I always get compliments from female co-workers.
207828,2,This is just soap drizzled over synthetic flower petals. This product is way over priced! I gave $18.25 for this. I have never been so disappointed with a product sold on Amazon. Don't waste your $.
33215,0,"I have been using this product for several months now and have noticed fine hair is growing in the areas where I apply the product. I was hoping for fuller hair, but hopefully after several more months, it will be much more noticeable."
168683,1,LOVE all of the AminoGenesis skin care products! Awesome cleanser . . . especially for very sensitive skin!
227963,0,"This is a great product - if you can get any on! The brush is too stiff and the product doesn't flow into the bristles easily. If you manage to apply the stain, it does last longer than ordinary lipstick. It is very dry, though. Don't think I'll buy again."
247250,0,"Love the color, but it dries matte. It's not a matte polish. So I don't know what is wrong with that."
66701,1,"excellent product..However, Amazon was extremely slow processing and shipping my order..I am not sure I want to order from Amazon again....!!!"
98896,1,I origally bought this cologne for my husband in a smaller size to see if I liked it and it smelled so good that I bought him the 3.4 ounce bottle. He loves it and so do I.
15891,1,"My 4 year old had flat warts on her chin. Dermatologists suggested strong systemic medications as well as retin-a. It occurred to me that witch hazel sloughs of dead skin cells just like retin-a does, so I thought I would give this a try instead. Her warts are gone! Plus, I use it to clear up my own blemishes. Dickinson's works better than any witch hazel I have ever tried. Well worth the price..."
128753,0,"I've been using Philosophy products for a while. I'm 31 and have dry skin and the ""hope"" series works great for me (Purity made simple, when hope is not enough, hope in a jar and hope in a tub). The Peel Pads feel great when you are applying it, refreshing and clean sensation, no burning like other pads I've tried. But I notices that after a few hours my skin gets a little oily, which didn't happen before I started using the pads. The pads are a little thinner than what I was expecting but it isn't a problem for me. I believe the product is a good one, but just not right for my type of skin."
244100,1,"I have very, very oily skin, and although this product is not specified for oily skin, it is extremely effective for removing excess oil and cleaning out my pores. Other products I've tried specifically formulated for oily skin tend to be overly drying and irritate my skin. This product doesn't irritate my skin at all. It's so gentle, I can't believe it's as effective as it is. It also leaves my skin squeaky clean and petal soft. Plus its full of wonderful botanicals. It's definately one of the best face washes on the market under 10 bucks."
37282,1,"Smells really good, i really like it, i could say have a citric notes, and make you feel fresh all day. Excellent."
135694,1,I wish it came in a larger size but the product itself is great. I use it on my stretch marks
110576,2,"There is a significant musk smell, but the lotion works great. Should be aware if you are allergic to Musk fragrance/natural odors? from the lotion... Great repair for skin. But if allergic to musk, be aware."

170293,0,"As a turquoise fanatic and nail polish enthusiast, I had to purchase this.Pros:-Only two coats needed-Bright color-Dries insanely fastCons:-Appears to be flat, no shimmer /gloss to it and thus a top coat of clear is needed. Some girls choose to skip this step but you can't really do that with this one.-The turquoise ended up being a teel that leans very green. This wasn't what I was looking for at all.-Thin polish that chips easily, another reason to need a top coat of clear."
4368,0,"How firm a foundation? The answer in regard to this pancake makeup is too firm.It reminds me of the makeup, although I can't remember the brand, that we used in our local little theaater group. But, these people were going on stage.However, if it's really thorough coverage that you want this may be the product for you. Just be sure you don't leave any &quot;embarkation lines&quot; around chin or ears."
195628,0,I like the lotion itself but it's really too smelly. Someone really nice on eBay sent me samples of all the scents and they're all just too much. I went back to Burt's Bees and gave this to my daughter.
221184,0,I was hoping for a soft scent. This is really STRONG! You can use it as a room deodorizer while still wrapped! This brand is terrific soap though and I love the mild honeysuckle one!
21425,0,"The perfum smells delicious, and the presentation of the product is nice,but the aroma lasts only a short time, and this is a very importantvalue in an eau the toilette, one expects to last longer."
25540,1,"I was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease 12 years ago, one year later I had to have a full hysterectomy. Between these two conditions, and having to take steroids in addition to the hormones and too many other drugs, I was miserable and had pretty much given up being able to wear makeup. Other than mascara and a little lip color/gloss, everything just sweated right off. The auto-immune disease has affected my skin in a few spots, two on my face and one on my neck, plus some on my arms. One on my forehead and the one on my neck are quite noticable. Depressing, to say the least. Cover-up-type makeup was way too heavy and looked just awful. But ERA (I bought the primer and the foundation) is a God send. As soon as I got it I actually sprayed it at my face, but it got everywhere all in my hair, and made it stiff like hairspray. I'm not supposed to actually use sprays of any kind so that was kind of stupid of me, anyway. So I read the instructions (!) and used a natural sponge, and it is light and sheer but covers and blends beautifully. It stays on and lasts. I feel like I look pretty again."
79892,2,"I've always been a fan of this hair mask but unfortunately I had to give it 1 star since the jar I got in the mail is either fake or defective. The stuff made my hair really really dry and tangled. I noticed right away because everytime after I put this hair mask on, I always touched my ends and they felt really soft and smooth; this time however they dont. I am returning this jar and probably wont never buy it from Amazon! BEWARE"
123658,0,"I am an African American woman. This is the first heat protectant I've used. I used it before blow-drying and was happy with the way it left my hair soft. The problem didn't come until I used it before pressing my hair. IT BURNED MY HAIR OFF! I was so mad I took it back. After discussing what happen to my aunt whose a beautician, I discovered that because the spray left my hair wet it burned off from my heat appliant. She said heat protectants are meant to work with blow-dryers and no more is needed for additional heat. I give it three stars for instructing to use on dry hair before applying heat. Besides that, its a good product."
190720,1,This soap makes our skin feel very soft and it has no harmful chemicals. Rated one of the best soaps for you on www.ewg.org under skin deep database.
180348,1,"My children have eczema so I cannot bathe them everyday, so this is a great alternative. I have noticed you have to use a lot to get a good lather and then towel dry hair well to get food, etc out of my children's hair, but this product has been great. Leaves both kids hair clean and shiny."
247376,0,"The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though."
25238,0,"This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it'll last you a while since not much is needed for one use. I'm not sure what the ""snake peel"" (or, even more interesting, the ""desert minerals"") are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin. This gel comes with blue, exfoliating micro-beads, but there are so few of them that their effect appears to be negligible, as is the after-scent of this so-so shower scrub."
101570,2,"Everywhere I go I have somebody complimenting my nails, and asking me about them, telling me how much they like them. It's a must have for any nail polish collection, I'm going to be purchasing the shatter in silver ASAP so I can wear it with dark shades too! Best part? even if you have trouble with the painting your right hand, it doesn't matter with this stuff because it's not supposed to be perfect, and touch ups are hardly noticeable!**UPDATE** 12/31/11For some reason the polish is all goopey and gross already. It is very difficult to use, and I'm not really happy about it... don't really understand what happened...**UPDATE** 2/11/12It's so thick and goopey that It's completely un-usable. even if i am able to get it smoothly across my nail, it no longer will ""evaporate"" (or however it works to create the ""shattered"" look). I'm really disappointed."
135351,2,My son loves this colgne and every year i get o line and order however this year it was so hard to find and so expensive. When i did order this it did not get here by christmas and it was so small i just laughed. If i had realized how small it was i would have never bought this
85173,0,"SO I haven't used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad."
77736,0,"I don't love the scent, it has a chemical smell that remains and seems stronger to me than the gardenia scent. I think it was expensive for the size and I will just stick with using organic coconut oil from now on."
10624,1,"I love it, it feels good when I use it, after using it my skin feels so smooth and soft. only problem I have with this product is I can't seem to find the replacement dove wipes in the store. I have been to several different stores and still have not found them. I guess I will have to find them online."
224416,0,"I have been using this for a month. It works amazingly on dry (or a little moist) hair. I did try on my hair (medium length and thickness) when wet (without blow drying; i.e. just towel dry hair)but it did not work. It took me quite long, however the end results were not even near perfect. However I'll refer this as worth the price, if you are looking for a normal hair straighter with no magical powers."
101769,0,"I wanted to like this acne treatment system, as it had a lot of features going for it:- I like the 3 step system.--- Step 1 is washing with the cleanser (used like soap) to remove oil and dirt--- Step 2 is called the ""Calming Toner"" is wiped on with cotton or a cosmetic pad and provides further cleaning of pores while at the same time soothing the skin--- Step 3 is a cream that is absorbed into the skin to kill acne causing bacteria, but also provide moisture.- The ingredients seem high quality.- The components each behave well when applied: The Cleanser washes off easily, the Toner absorbs/evaporates quickly, and the cream absorbs readily.- I like the scents: Pleasantly floral, but not too feminine.The instructions include the warning that you may need to ""ease into"" using the cream as it may cause dry skin. I did find that I experienceds some irritation when using the cream, but it was only brief and did not ultimately seem to dry out my skin.So why only 3 stars? Well for all its benefits, it did not seem to adequately control break-outs for me. I do not have a serious acne problem, but rather suffer from occasional blemishes . After using this system for a week I did not see any diminishment in the frequency or severity of these break-outs. I may actually have noticed an increase in frequency, which I think may be attributable to the cream (step 3) which although moisturizing may also be clogging my pores. I will continue to try the system with only steps 1 and 2.In conclusion I think this is a high quality system, but it did not work for me. Everyone's skin and reactions are different though, so if you are willing to give it a try it may be worth it."
220776,1,This is the cologne that my husband wears and I love it. It is nice to be able to purchase at a much lower price. I bought two bottles for the price I would generally pay for one at the department store.
151267,1,"I love this product! Anytime one changes a cleansing product, you have to go through an adjustment period. I found that during no period that I utilized the replacement product for men... My skin did not react well or adjust. Now, I have nearly twenty packages in my cabinet. I hope that they continue to provide this product."
101704,0,"Very beautiful nail polish, but it chips easily so I'd suggest applying at least 3 coats. Another drawback is that it is a pain to get off since it's glitter nail polish. Might have to soak nails in acetone for easier removal. Other than that, very good product."

2635,0,"I used to wear this cologne in my early 20s. Since then my taste has changed and I prefer Chanel Egoiste Platinum. I thought I'll wear Cigar again. I still liked the smell, but my wife thought it made me smell like an old guy, so I stopped using it."
233340,0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
52333,0,"While the blending of orange blossom and jasmine is luscious, this fragrance is a bit heavy for me. Perhaps I erred in buying the eau de parfum and should have purchased the eau de toilette. I've read that about three-fourths of eau de parfum is lost after several hours. That's not been my experience with Carolina Herrera. In fact, the aroma is still in the crook of my elbows until I wash it off, and it's as if I had just applied it. For many that may be a major attribute.However, my preference is for a much lighter scent - sort of a ""barely there."" While this fragrance is lovely, I wouldn't recommend wearing it to a concert or any place where you'll be in close quarters with others who may not want to enjoy your wonderful aroma.If your plans are for an evening in some secluded spot with a special someone - enjoy!"
147573,0,"I bought it to dry my hair while I applied make-up, kill two birds with one stone, but my hair is still wet and requires a regular blow dryer. It does speed up the regular drying but not as much as I hoped. If you have hair of any length and expect this to dry your hair completly, you better have an hour."
79969,0,"This works really well. It is not time-consuming, it's easy, and it works sooo great. It leaves your hair really soft and silky and hydrated than it ever would be. It is a little pricey, but on Amazon it is way cheaper than in Target, and the product seems to be authentic.ONE THING. It smell so, so strong. Looking at the outside of this product, it seems so natural and mild. But the scent it so strong i can smell it even when the jar is closed... Now, I am a very sensitive girl when it comes to scents, but the smell is strong even for someone not as sensitive as I am.It smells like a lot of chemicals.. not natural at all, not fresh, and it's kind of weird. Totally unpleasant. It smells like it tried TOO hard to smell good and then failed.I'm so glad i bought 8.5 oz instead of 16 oz, because that would have been a lot of money wasted.I wanted to love this so much, but turns out that I don't."

160068,0,"I can't say anything bad or good about this product because, I don't know if it worked. I used it for a few months, but didn't see any improvements in my hair growth. I was also using other hair growth prodcuts as well so...I just don't know. To each it's own."
185295,1,"The Dermalogica Exfoliating Body Scrub is one of the best scrubs I have ever used. It leaves your skin looking illuminated and feeling smooth. It is best to be used with the Conditioning Body Wash, but this scrub is one of my favorites!"

136606,0,"I am a big fan of Aubrey Organics and use their Rose Honeysuckle Shampoo (which is awesome), however, this product didn't do it for me. It worked well taming my coarse, wavy hair, but I couldn't get over the smell. It leaves a very unpleasant scent in my hair. Have to return it unfortunately."
233283,2,"I love Shi cologne so I thought I would try the shower gel. Unfortunately, the Shi fragrance in the shower gel was not very strong and the after affects did not leave my skin soft and smooth. Also, there was the problem with the atomizer top continually falling off. I ended up sending it back. I had hoped for more. . .I would not recommend it to anyone."
40817,1,Burberry Brit for men is greatBUT amazon's photo does not reflect what is shipped to youthe burberry bag is not included when I received my order. The reason I ordered this product was to have this whole awesome set and if you are like me and were expecting the bag it does not come.
117587,0,"Recommended to me by a health specialist at Whole Foods. She said there is a huge difference between activated and not-activated beauty products. She said MyChelle is activated and recommended (above all others) this and the Serum from this company. It feels good going on, but do not notice a difference yet and it has been months ... Disappointed. I will talk with her again."
161784,1,I was very pleased with my order. Arrived earlier than expected and product was just as I expected. I will definitely place future orders.
158217,1,"Where was this item in the 60's when I really could have used it instead of rollers? If you have naturally curly hair, and you like the smoother looks, this hot air brush is for you! Great price, and the ONLY place I can find it is on Amazon! I couldn't live without it!"
146809,0,"It really does the job taking of makeup, amazingly well. I've used it on everything from long wearing foundation to mascara to gel liner and paint pots and it makes pretty darn short work of them all. It may need a lil work on water proof mascara. The only negative is that where the consistency is almost exactly like water, you do need to be careful not to totally soak your cotton pad when you're taking your eye makeup off, or when you press it onto your eye, you'll get the product in your eye- it may hurt a bit if it goes in your eye. While it isn't in the cheapest range, you will get your money's worth. A little goes a long way and it's actually an amazing product. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all."
112470,2,"I cannot believe I got scammed so bad, thank God I didn't pay the original price. This not what Celine Dion smells like! I got this same perfume about 3 months ago at [...] and I fell in love with it, so I decided to get a bigger bottle from this site worse mistake ever. The perfume smelled like it went bad (which I don't think is possible) this perfume has a naturally soft smell below is the product description: ""Celine Dion Perfume contains an inspiring blend of light luscious floral including water lily orange blossom and exotic tiare flower balanced with warm rich amber sheer musk and pristine blonde woods the result is a scent that's perfect for every day yet still sophisticated enough for special occasions. Notes include Red Berry Dew Heliotrope Italian Bergamot Lily of the Valley Cyclamen Mist Violets Yellow Rose Osmanthus Tiare Flower Accord Orange Blossom Jasmine Muguet Blonde Woods Sandalwood Warm Amber Sheer Musk"".That junk smells nothing like the above description; it smells like it went bad. I don't know if perfume can expire (which I doubt) but this one might have. It's as if they mixed with 55% PISS and 45% what was suppose to Celine Dion original scent. They didn't even send it in the original perfume box; I just got it in a brown box with bubble wrap. I know it's a test product, but there's no reason why it should smell like it is still being tested for sale approval. Please keep in mind that the real Celine Dion smells really GOOD, but this version is not the real thing or maybe just the one I got."
85079,0,Comb only gets hot intermittently. It's not good for straightening natural hair. If you only need a warm comb this would work for you.

56563,0,"This sweet almond oil makes a pretty awesome leave-in conditioner for my hair. And blended with some shea butter, it makes the best moisturizer for my feet! However, it's really hard with this bottle to get just a few drops out. You have to apply a lot of pressure and then you get a big squirt. If there was some way to control the amount of product you squeeze out, I would give this five stars."
93299,2,"I don't like these at all! They are nice and sharp, but the part of the handle that you press down on in order to actually clip gets caught on the rest of the handle if it isn't lined up absolutely perfectly. The problem is that when you're trying to deal with tiny wiggly little fingers, it's hard to keep this part from swiveling slightly off center. You try to clip, and it gets stuck yet again. They're a pain to use. The handle needs to have a much wider channel for the top part to fit in."
64243,1,"Chest Wrinkles Miraculously (but temporarily) Disappear! It was amazing to see smooth, young-looking skin again!I knew the application of this product would only be temporary, but that's OK! For special occasions, when choosing a scoop neck top or low vee neck, this item is WONDERFUL!It's washable with mild soap & water, and the ""stickum"" seems to renew a little after washing.I bought a second one to use when the first is finally exhausted.Wish you made some for neck, too!"
143658,0,I have always loved this sent. It's VERY light. I spray it on in the morning and two hours later I can't smell it. I just wish it would last longer.
58084,2,"Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it contains preservatives and chemicals(DMDM Hydantoin(which releases formaldehyde into the product!!, Pentasodium Pentetate,Tetrasodium Etidronate)yet they say its all natural based?? Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou's Natural Milk Baths and Soaps. They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something without any chemicals and is vegetable based."
222685,1,"I have worn this for years. It is one on my favorite perfumes. I find the scent intoxicating, romantic and sensual."
199081,2,It worked well for about three months...It will not heat up at all after that...Bad investment!!! It is not worth the money. I would not buy another one. You can buy the regular one for $15 and it will last longer.
57107,0,"This product really did seem to diminish fine lines and make my skin appear smoother. However, finding the time to use this product during my busy day was difficult. I found it a little too time-consuming. I think it's something I would save for special occasions."
40333,0,I received this product in a timely manner and in good shape;however I had been given this as a gift last year and loved it. This bottle did not smell the same so I was disappointed by that. Not sure why but I don't like the way this one smells.But I did receive the order quickly and in good shape!
128550,0,It smells a lot lighter than the ones I buy in stores.I have to use more of this to smell it.
135031,0,The only problem I found with this curlers is that only 5 come in each package. I still wish they could be bigger. I like the clippers because they stay in place. I wish they could heat up a bit more but I guess I need to take care of my hair and the velvet does protect it. I think if I buy 3 more packages it would be just fine for all the hair I have. The box is well designed since it's not that big and doesn't take that much space. I prefer this curlers than the Remington ones.
69252,1,I USE THIS PRODUCT AND COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE BUT ON AMAZON.COM. IT IS THE ONLY HAIR GEL I USE

244647,2,"I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews, but it really let me down! I switched over from Bliss No Zit Sherlock face wash because this one was cheaper but unfortunately I've experienced horrible breakouts ever since. My pores are clogged and I'm getting zits all around my hairline and chin.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who has acne. Very disappointed!"
87491,0,"Pros: It didn't irritate my skin, it didn't smell bad, it was inexpensive to tryCons: It didn't seem like anything changed (but maybe my skin isn't at the point where change would be noticeable?), possibly had minor breakouts related to this lotion.I don't know that this did anything for me other than just act like any other moisturizer and clog my pores a little. I'll keep it in mind to try again in a couple of years when maybe my skin has matured enough that this might affect it."
1175,0,"it softens water, but the connection between the showerhead and the hose is somewhat loose, so sometimes it leaks."
67031,2,"Smells great but the first time it shipped I received the wrong product. The second time it came it was leaking, but at least my gym bag doesn't smell like sweaty socks anymore. I highly recommend the product just next time I will be buying it from a store nearby."

THXS"
69562,0,"The product does its main purpose quite well. I have yet to have any issues with the mirror fogging up. However, the main valve on the mirror really restricts flow to the showerhead. For me, this was a big issue so I actually removed the valve (w/ dremel tool) and now have unrestricted flow and the fogless mirror. So if you don't mind doing a little work on the product prior to use, this mirror will work fine."
162294,0,"Product ordered was the product delivered. This is product I use on a regular basis on my face, so I received what I wanted and needed, therefore my rating is on the service provided by HBC Depot, which was simply ""Ok"". There was nothing extraordinary or special required of HBC Depot other than simply taking product from their shelf, packaging it and mailing it. HBC Depot is not the manuafacturer of the product, just simply a supplier of the product. The ""Olay Total Effects"" product line I am extremely pleased with."

28295,1,It is easy to use and works great. I have been using since it came and It works as described.
48750,0,"Pros: it works.Cons: if you don't use it, your face goes back as how it was before use after less than a week of dicountinuation in use. There must be something better in the market, I've heard of Galvanizer something...Also ... if you set the device to maximum, my wife said she was seeing balls of lights in front of her eyes when applicating this device in her forehead (some time after that there was liquid in an mri in the forehead area). She stopped using it.And now we have a $300.00 device getting dust in the bathroom.I hope this help before you buy it."
173722,1,smells good and feels really relaxing but i can't tell if it helps with hair growth ? I couldn't tell a difference at all. Amazon has the best price too
104995,1,"The first time I took a sample of this cologne, I have to be honest, I didn't like it. But as time pass (very quickly by the way), the scent became unique. Every time I stop by Macy's, I have o take a sample because it is to irresistible. I finally bought the cologne at an amazing here in Amazon and I don't look back on my decision. I highly recommend this cologne if your curious and into something different concerning scent. I like all types of colognes, but I haven't scene any strong cologne like this one. Great for wearing in the winter, night out with friends, getting girls. Whatever!!!"

My daughter scraped her leg, 2""x2"" clear to the Facia layer (just above the bone)... we used several containers of the skin ointment for a month of new dressings and the skin is all healed and beautiful. The severly damaged area never thought about getting infected! Simply THE BEST natural 'antibiotic' ointment around! Wish it would come in a larger container, however with this size you can carry one with you where ever you go. I have many other amazing stories I could share about this wonderful product; I could probably write a book!"
137883,0,"Let me start by saying that my wife loves the lotion. However, the lotion was not delivered in its original box, and the bottle wasn't clean. The price was terrific, so I give the purchase experience 3 stars. The product itself is a 5."
230449,0,"I was picking between the Face & Body and the HD Invisible Cover, and unfortunately went with this one due to its better ratings on MakeUpAlley, despite my already having tried the HD Invisible Cover with pretty awesome results. The foundation appears really runny, and unevenly pigmented. I did try shaking the jar before each use, but that doesn't help much. What's worse is that there is almost no coverage whatsoever. Whatever I put on my face seems to vanish. I don't have a whole lot of blemishes, but I was really hoping to get a more even skin-tone with this foundation. Sadly, I don't get it. I may go in and exchange my Face & Body for an Invisible Cover instead."

Alas the old brush had begun to loose some bristle and I deemed it time to replace it. Well, the new one arrive and I quickly noticed that the number of bristles (small groups of bristles) have been dramatically reduced -- perhaps by as much as 40% ! It is certainly not the same brush that I had expected and used so comfortably over all these years."

19376,0,"I don't know ladies....I wish that I found this site and your comments PRIOR to watching last weekend's BE Anniversary program on a television shopping program which shall remain nameless.After experiencing the dreadfull after effects from a Thyroid condition and its removal - my once lovely, even, oft-complimented beauty queen skin is ravaged. I can hardly think about leaving my home, whereas ""once upon a time"" I could hardly be found I was so out and about town. I hate to even go outside and garden because even my normally polite neighbors have lost their graciousness by looking at me and remarking ""what happened to your face?"".Normally when I needed ""foundation"", I used Fashion Fair's pressed powder for oily skin (Walnut/Pecan depending on the season). For those of us with deeper pigment, you know what I am talking about. This product worked for more than 5 years to combat the various remnants of a breakout. I could still see my skin under the product, but a dab directly on the ""remnant"" would do just fine.I had heard about BE via its infamous infomercials- never bothering to watch all the way thru because it felt like a gimmick and I neeeever really saw anyone with a darker hue on the program. This past weekend - I thought it was a Que from the universe that I accidentally caught the Anniversary Sale program. The colors and demonstrations were wonderful and better than the infomercial in that they actually used two(2) models of Colour. I should have listened to my inner voice when I had to call and ask....""when the Models used for a particular product are all Caucasian models...should I take that to mean that the product being shown is primarily for those of European descent?... I was told that BE was for all Skin tones. Being in my early 40's...I should not have fallen for the oky-doke...but I did. I was...am desperate to feel better.I ordered the tinted Mineral veil, the Honey Bisque( both have come with brushes) and I am now waiting for the Latte Buzz Collection (Warmth, Glee and Radiance). Of course now confusion sets in...should I have ordered the Warmth Radiance? Is the Radiance, True, Clear or Warmth? I did not order the Foundation. The colors offered did not seem true even on the program (nor were the two newest darker colors offered)- - however, this weekend I am heading to Sephora to get samples of Deep, Dark, Deepest Deep and a 4th kind of dark (I think).I have worked for the last 2 days with the Veil and Bisque and together I look like the Last Black Deadish Morticia. It did not get any better even after I applied the FF (with a brush)over it to get some ""color"" back. That ""glowy"" sheen that everyone is talking about is underneath doing something...I can't put my finger on it. It is quite peculiar and not in a good way.Yes, everything is lite as a feather. I do not feel ""mask-like""...but admittedly it is not doing anything but highliting my ""issues"".I will continue to try to work with this product (after all it has only been 2 days - - but nothing else has taken 2 days for me to become satisfied or decide whether or not it was for me) and get samples before I spend anymore big bucks on this product. I am really hoping it will work, given some time. Thankfully the shopping program has a 30 day money back guarantee.Thank you all for your honesty and I'll let you know!"
34041,0,This perfume was just sort of ok I think. It's not what I remembered it being many years ago. I wish companies would sell samples to try out rather then buying a whole bottle and not caring for it.
11072,1,I have never been able to get all of my layers to turn under nicely until I tried this hot air brush. It is easy to use and my hair looks almost as good as the blowouts I get from my stylist!
102636,1,I don't wear anything else and this was cheaper than buying from the department or drug store.LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE. It smells soooooo goood.update: I still only use this fragrance. Had alot of compliments. Its light but seductive in smell.
125338,0,"Smells OK, but not great. There's way too much cinnamon in the mix that completely overpowers the rest of the fragrance, it just smells like I'm putting on cinnamon oil. The bottle is cheap plastic, I expected glass from the picture and the cost. Despite the name, there's no rum in it. The sweet smell comes from benzene which is carcinogenic. Disappointed after ordering it I found the same brand and bottle at my local chain drug store for less than half of what I paid. I probably won't reorder this type."
18846,0,"I have been using Bare Minerals in Fairly Light for three years, and while it is better overall than any liquid foundation on the market for sensitive skin, it's not great. This powder highlights the dry areas of my skin and does not hold up well against midday shine on my T-zone. Also, I think I may be slightly allergic/sensitive to mica, because my face feels a little itchy right after applying. I've only continued using it because I have been unable to find something better.Until now, that is. Meow Cosmetics is a small internet-based brand, they have 3 coverage formulations and over 80 shade choices, and you get three times the amount of product for the same price as Bare Minerals. I find that their formulation is gentler on my skin and offers better coverage, and I will be switching brands as soon as I finish off my last jar of Bare Minerals."
148078,2,"I bought this at the store because the sales woman said this was an excellent product for newborns. I've used it with my 1 month old and must say I disagree. The general scent of the shampoo is nice, but the lotion is overwhelming especially for a newborn. Newborns smell lovely as is, so I don't think there is any need for perfume overload."
110109,0,It's wayyyyy to floral for me. Sharply so. This doesnt smell very sexy in my opinion; it's a nice smell but way too sweet & flowery- Even after I rubbed it into skin & let it sit. I even put it on my armpits lol (that was the best smelling option :X) long lasting & noticeable but not overpowering.
87767,2,"Today I purchased this product at an authorized Bumble & bumble. salon. I compared it to what I had left of the one I ordered from Amazon.com:1. It smells completely different. The one from Amazon.com does smell of a harsh chemical and plastic.2. The feel of your hair after using it is completely different. The one from the salon is how it should feel, very tangle free hair. The one from Amazon.com is, well, I don't know what's in it.Highly recommend you do not purchase through amazon.com."
169487,1,"I used to dye my hair to get my original color back but cannot anymore due to the fact that I have allergic reactions to hair dye and can never use them again. I have used grecian foam for two weeks now and definitely see quite a difference. Not only is my hair slowly returning to its natural color, it also feeler thicker and has so much more body then before. I have very thin hair and it makes my hair look great. I wash my hair every other to every third day so it is taking a little longer than it should but that's fine. The only problem I have is that I would like the company to make it unscented or a much more appealing fragrance. The smell is not so great but I just put on a lot of perfume to mask it and it seems to work fine."
161553,1,great product and at a great price.....just the type of product I seek out. The andis dryer is light and comfortable to hold...and easy to use.
110421,2,"I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this. Was so anxious to get it. Other reviews were great so I am wondering if mine just got messed up or something. It stinks. Really stinks. Nothing musky at all about this. It smells like hand soap but not the good kind. So disappointed. Cant even describe the smell - just a strong flowery scent and smells like cheap soap / lotion."
54888,1,"This perfume has a great smell. It is not too overwhelming, but light and airy. Great for any occasion!"
117639,2,"When I got this product it was not what was pictured for sale,it was totally different and did not smell right."
104613,0,"I've had this for about a month now and the staples that hold the bristles, are already rusted. Since the handle and bristles are white, the rust really shows. It still functions (the bristles are firm enough to get dirt out but not so stiff that it hurts), but it is unsightly. I'm surprised a product designed to be held under running water would have rustable parts."
128243,2,"The ACE Pocket Combs that come out nowadays are substandard in quality. They look great out coming out the packaging and that first couple of times you use it. But, if you put one in your pocket thinking you can carry it, ... think again! I broke one a few days ago just sitting down on a padded golf cart seat. After replacing it, I broke the next one simply getting undressed in the evening. Taking my pants off, and I heard the comb snap.POOR QUALITY! These combs used to be awesome, but that was a different time when the company actually cared about their product and their customers."
228567,0,"The shampoo has a lovely lemon scent and works great. The conditioner is a waste of money. It's consistency is about that of any over the counter conditioner you can buy and I have to use just as much as those low end conditioners. Others have claimed to see less hair loss, I haven't noticed that at all."

11254,1,This is my favorite eyelash curler. Like it even better than Shu Uemura.I am Native American and have eye lashes that do not curl easily. This does the job well.
68486,1,"I was looking for a natural-fiber exfoliating cloth and I ordered this one. Other reviewers complained that it rolled up when they used it so I was prepared. I have used it twice now and I love it. I don't mind at all that it rolls up -- it's a natural fiber and it is not natural for it to stay in a square when wet. If they mixed it with cotton, it would stay more square, but then it wouldn't be 100% fiber. I am happy with the performance and I feel like my skin is smoother after only 2 days. I will use it daily, and I am happy with it!UPDATE: October 17, more than a month of using this daily and it is still in excellent condition and my skin is SILKY. I use different body washes with it, so I credit the cloth for the super soft skin. Yay!"
240494,2,"I knew they said jumbo but this is like the size of my head, I would not recommend this size."
25473,2,"never sent me the makeup, never refunded my money, never heard anything else...contacting them is useless too. i love bioelements and recommend anything bioelements but will never order beauty bridge again."
165735,0,The spray bottle doesn't work well. Have to jiggle and turn it after every squirt to get it to squirt again. Hope it doesn't stop working all together before the perfume is gone.
52258,1,"LOVE this stuff. I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and really long so the weight of my hair pulls down any body I would have making my hair look limp. I've also had a baby recently and all my hair is falling out!! However, after about 5 squirts of the BB Thickening Spray, I have fuller, bouncier hair and who doesn't want that?! I spray it on my freshly clean hair when it is wet, then flip my head over and blow dry. I have coupled the spray with BB Straightening gel because my hair can get weird and wavy in moisture. The end result is clean feeling, soft, full hair. I have noticed that if I get a little over excited and spray too much of the spray it will make my hair feel a bit more tacky than I like. So I would say you have to experiment with the amount that will work for you."
124801,0,"i ordered the conditioner after reading the review thinking it will make my hair little more conditioned and silky.it didn't make any difference even though I put it in my hair, wrapped in warm towel for more than 30 min. Maybe it will be better effective to someone who's hair is thinner or didn't have much chemical processing.I don't think it was worth or effective more than store bought conditioner such as pantene or others.for the info, i color and magic straighten my hair, but rarely use tools."
154452,0,"Their eco-friendly idea is really nice but, I wouldn't say this is the ultimate makeup sponge.It is really smooth and the shape is creative. However, for me, the size was somewhat awkward and didn't seem to apply my liquid foundation evenly.Since I bought the applicators almost a year ago, I used them about 10 times.. So, I probably won't buy again."
139785,0,"While in my teens I used Mane n' Tail products religiously. Back then, I felt their product line was the only thing on the market built to deal with my semi-coarse curly/ kinky hair. I come from a line of ""mixed"" type hair (half black half white), and tho my hair is not too coarse, it is very curly and dried easily. In addition, I might add that I live in a desert, so high moisture/ intense hydration products are a must.Mane n' Tale as a whole is a decent product line, but now that I'm an adult and have more knowledge and awareness about chemicals and alcohol use in products, I no longer feel their line is for me.I purchased this leave-in on a whim. I was looking for a product that would hold my daughter and I off until I had the time to do some homework on leave-ins.As a leave-in, this product is OK. The spray cap mists onto hair and provides a wide area of coverage, and the spray itself has a decent smell, but overall, this product (like many others) merely provides the illusion of moisture. A few minutes after application, both my hair and my daughters felt dry yet gooey to the touch. This is the same problem I experienced with the Giovanni 'Organic' leave-in conditioner. These products are made by carriers who mass produce, so in efforts to spread their product so costs are efficient for both them and the customer, some quality is lost along the way. In the case of some of these leave-ins, they usually carry a blend of ingredients that promotes a sort of illusory moisture, meaning it feels okay at first, but once the chemicals dry you may experience an adverse effect. After some research, the best explanation for this I can give is that these products are more focused on instant gratification than long-term sustainability. Products like this are great at first, then after a year or so of use, suddenly your hair is falling out, or its a lot dryer than usual and you don't know how to correct the issue because the last thing you'd expect is your leave-in, but sure enough it's the little things that can cause the most damage.A true fix: I've found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out... (Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water). Second, keep your hair PH balanced, especially while shampooing or while using a leave-in. If you need to educate yourself on how PH balancing works with your hair, please go to youtube and watch videos by kimmaytube. You can type ""Kimmaytube ph balance"" in the search. Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture sealing.As much as I respect American business, so long as these over-the-counter leave-ins try to combine herbal ingredients with chemicals, they will never grant true health or repair to human hair. Hair is an organic extension of the human body, so the products we use should be minimal, clean, and their richness should depend on the texture of your hair and the humidity in your environment. My recommendations would be Shea hair moisture cream products mixed with Aloe Vera gel and either Jojoba oil or Castor oil(40/40/20 blend)."
156993,0,i guess it is not a true ceramic curling iron but it is pretty good and is a good deal for the price
32308,2,"No where on the description does it explain that this is merely a pad that goes inside a compact...which is not included.I feel ripped off. I am able to return the item but despite being a Prime item, I have to pay return shipping charges."
204889,1,"I L O V E this cream!It glides on like a second skin, instantly absorbs, smells awesome and really makes an immediate noticeable difference in the smoothness of my skin. I just used the last drop a couple of nights ago.I didn't mind scooping out the cream, but I would suggest a pump in a different shape container for sanitary purposes.Yes, I will definitely buy this one again, and again. Love it!"
37568,1,"I bought this based on the reviews and ratings it received. At first, I was somewhat skeptical about its risky scent. It did smell a little rubbery at first, but it disappears, on me at least, after twenty minutes and turns into a more vanilla-like scent that lasts all day long. I highly recommend this scent! And the bottle itself is gorgeous, too."
192366,0,Tjis head is smaller than my head so when I try to use it to make a u part wig it makes it a little difficult. I measured around the head of this item and it was 21 inches
237458,1,"Overall, I love this soap. It does have a somewhat &#34;medicinal&#34; smell, but I might add some mint to soften it. If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren't familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents."
42639,0,"This mascara wasn't clumpy and I liked the wand. However, it was difficult to wash off. (I prefer mascara that comes off easily with soap and water.) I rated it a 3 because I felt that it was an average mascara, nothing spectacular."
243586,0,"I had ordered through Amazon the item named ""Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge-1 ea."" through Amazon. This was the same item I had previously ordered which came in a green box. Unfortunately, there is another ""Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge-1 ea."" which comes in a white and gold box, and is somewhat rougher to the skin touch than that which is in the green. There is otherwise no way to tell the difference in these two products by their packaging description, nor any other that I can determine. Again, unfortunately, this supplier did not distinguish the two items, and sent the product in the White and Gold box instead. (I had ordered two of each, for my own comparison test; both suppliers--there is a different supplier for each product--sent the same white and gold box. Therefore my ""scientific"" test is shot.)All this preface to tell you that the Buf-Puf is the best bathing appliance since soap, in my opinion. It provides enough abrasion to feel as if you've removed all the body oils and dirt, as well as leaving the skin ""tingly"". Although I've tried both the rough and smooth sides (the blue and the white sides), I can tell no difference in the feel of the skin afterwards. I suppose women with their softer skin could notice a difference on elbows, knees, and feet; I just could not.In essence, this product is heads and shoulders above a simple washcloth; If I didn't have a Buf-Puf, I'd forego bathing. (Hmmm, maybe that's why I was avoided while awaiting their delivery.)"
194968,2,"I bought this shampoo as a companion to the conditioner version of it. Neither the conditioner nor the shampoo did anything to my hair. I was hoping that my hair would stop falling, but it feels like it became worse. I wish I could really find a shampoo with good price that would stop my hair from falling. I don't recommend this product."
16780,0,"I bought this to display crocheted scarves and hats. The neck is nice and long, but the head is small, more like the size of a child or small adult. I didn't expect too much, but it would have been nice for the head to be more accurate of the average woman. Fortunately, the face is pretty long, so most things relatively fit. I guess the upside is that I can also display things I make for a child, though I don't see myself buying this again. :)"
118310,0,"Having an oster wall mounted hairdryer in excess of 10 years , that had 3 speeds , it is a little difficult getting accustomed to a two speed model. ( this is what the newer ones are ) If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be very happy"
93909,2,"I am a 27yo male with diffuse thinning, particularly bad at the crown. This product is like a normal gel, does does not add volume but it does allow your hair to stand up on end, again like any other gel product. if your hoping this will add body and volume to cover those thin spots don't waste your time. Its a shame as I use toppik hair fibres on a daily basis and I swear by them. I find mixing a bit oil free moisturiser and volumeising conditioner and using it as a gel works far better then any fattening product I have used."
53803,0,"Thought the mirror was bigger, didn't pay attention to dimensions in description...love the idea of battery operated, can be moved/used anywhere"
12506,1,"Enamora fragrancePerry is a captivating scent that France alone, each time I use it gives the feeling of excellence to attract attention by the sweet scent that combines the delight of the perfume with the image of a current"
194608,2,"I LOVE the color of Flip Flop Fantasy (neon orangey-pink). Unfortunately the nail polish is really watery, goes on streaky (needs 3 coats of color), dries with a matte finish, and chips within 2-3 days, even with top and bottom coats. I tried it once on my toes and once on my hands and I had the same experience both times. As much as I love the color, I doubt I will try it again- not worth the effort because it doesn't last."
3555,0,Really like this product just disappointed. They used to send samples of their other products when you made a purchase. So I'm a little disappointed. It was greatly appreciated.
233755,2,"I was hesitant to purchase lipstick without actually seeing it first but, went ahead anyway. I was happy when the package arrived however, when I opened the package I saw a small, dirty box. Inside was the lipstick, very true to color when I removed the top and looked but, at the same time it had a stale, rancid smell which immediately indicated to me that this product had probably been sitting on a shelf for some time.If I'm going to pay over $10 for a lipstick, it better be new and smell fresh. BEWARE."
6940,0,This is nice eye cream. I've used it now for three weeks and I'm not sure if I notice a difference yet. But I use it every day - morning and night. It's not sticky and smells good.
105727,0,"I had a CHI (no temp dial) for about 3 years. It was great. I took it to Europe and even with a converter, it shorted out. So, my stylist recommended this flat iron - especially because it has the temp control. It's just okay. I am African-American. I have mixed texture, unrelaxed hair. This iron and the CHI produce a nice silky effect on my hair. I just feel like the CHI got the job done quicker."
111274,2,"I have used the Garnier Fructis shake effect ligui-effect for years. When I found this on this site was excited. BUT, what I received is different bottle and different name. If company changed bottles and names it should be noted on the sellers site and picture changed. Will try it as I hate the hastle of return.I was disappointed in this vendor but after talking to him he resolved the issue to my satisfaction. Will likely use this vendor again. Would also give 5 stars. thanks"
119461,2,"Doesn't reduce static cling- actually makes it worse. But does make clothes pretty soft. Still, you need to use dryer sheets for the static (which irritates skin) so not much point buying these."
187321,2,"I use both Biotin shampoo and conditioner. I've normal thick wavy Asian hair and light conditioner usually works. However, this conditioner does NOT detangle my hair, instead makes me loss a large amount as if I'm using hair remover. The shampoo makes a lot of tangles. Both have biotin and organics but the actual quality is totally different from advertised. The smell is unpleasant. When I purchased these, there were no review. Hope this will help your purchase."
60969,1,I am allergic to permanent haircolor. This semipermanent color covers my white hair well and will allow me to look a little younger for a little longer.
166139,0,"Not nearly as good as nutregena mask, but is ok for the price. Helps with swelling, and gives a little better color to face, but not really good enough of a product"
231243,1,This is the perfect red shade of nail polish ...not too red and not too pink. Just that right mix!
243362,1,I just started using the L'Anza product line and absolutely love them. The detangler works great on my hair as I seem to get a lot of tangles. Thanks L'Anza!
28328,2,"Had this item for a year now and it just broke on me, so I figured I needed to write a review to warn buyers. When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn't close all the way but it really didn't bother me much. I've had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn't purchase again."
244159,0,"I enjoyed using this product. The scent is very clean with an old-fashioned feel to it. It lathers nicely and rinses easily. At first, I tried the soap on my face. I found it to be less drying than regular soap, but more drying than my usual dry skin cleansing regimens. Then I used the soap in the shower. This is where I enjoyed it the most. It had an overall moisturizing effect. I would purchase this product and use it regularly in the shower."
236649,0,"The first few days I wore this it was great. But, after five days or so, I could feel the extra elastic that is underneath the pad and my big toe started hurting like I was walking on a lump. Hope others are more successful."
21553,0,"I really like TIGI products in general - always great quality. This Smoothing Lusterizer is good, but not great. The bottle arrived with a broken hinge on the lid for one thing. But aside from that, I find it leaves my hair rather dry. I like the ""lusterizing"" sparkle it leaves in my hair, and it definitely smoothes out the frizz. But after about 7 hours, and especially in low-humidity conditions, I find that my hair starts to feel dry and somewhat frizzy. I'd recommend this for someone who lives in an all-year humid climate, but I don't know that it is the best de-frizzer for dry winter weather."
177981,2,"Doesn't perform as claimed. Good moisterizing lip cream with a tingle, but no better plumping performance for lips than any of several brands already tried, some cheaper and many more expensive. Perhaps a topical can't really do the trick."
55311,2,"HELP, DOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM? Seven months ago I used my zeno just like the instructions stated, just like the previous time, only this time it was like a jolt and sting,I put ice on it and went to bed when I woke up the next morning I had a blister where i used my zeno it was burning and red. It took me three weeks for the sore that formed to heal,that was 7 months ago and it is still peeling. My doctor said it was a bad burn and if I continues peeling I will need skin graft, my skin is so thin from it and it is on top of my nose so I am dreading a graft.Has anyone else had a burn from their Zeno?"
60339,0,"The delivery was prompt and the condition of the item was great, but I was disappointed by the actual color of the polish. On this site, it looks to be a very light purple/lavender/lilac shade, but really, it's more of a light pink that you could get at any store."
220810,2,I did my homework and noted that product users noted a difference between the contents that were manufactured in the US and those that came from China. I specifically went with a listing that stated that the product was made in the USA. Bought it from BIGFLYSPORTS and the container clearly says &#34;Made in China&#34;. I'm very annoyed with this misrepresentation.
152119,0,"The product has been working wonders on my hair. Its really good.. makes your hair darker, stronger and denser. The only problem was the seller, He didn't provide any shipping tracking no. I was left guessing the arrival time. & it took little more than the usual shipping time(around 7-8 business days)."
167257,1,"It is deliciously wonderful. It leaves my skin smooth, soft and smelling wonderful. It really is coming in handy with swimming and having the chlorine drying my skin out. I am definitely going to buy more, and you really can't beat the price!!! Thank you for a great product.Maureen Jackson"
162327,0,This is a nice rose and makes your lips look natural. That's all I can say about it. You won't get a glossy effect and the color fades quickly. What else is there to say?
144781,0,I love the fragrance of the body wash and lotion. This roller ball is really tiny and barely has any smell to it at all. I have never tried the cologne but I wouldn't buy this again.
128327,1,"Unfortunately you can't get this Nivea product in the US. Nivea discontinued their US line of bath gels. This import from Germany is as great as their previous US line, but with a new line of fragrances. I tried several and this one is really nice. I can't get over how soft the shower gel leaves my skin, and that's why I can't recommend it enough. There may be other products out there that work as well, but they are way more expensive, and even with shipping costs, this is a steal!"
244785,1,This product is excellent. No other moisturizer has made my skin so smooth and silky. Give this product a try; you won't be disappointed.
207984,0,"This product works fine for your hair if they are dry, however it says to put it on and leave it on overnight...I couldn't do that! The smell is so strong that I couldn't sleep. I was consireding to turning it back because of the smell but first I decided to try to leave it on during the day when I am at home. This is way better! It nourrishes your hair and let them smooth and shiny. The shipping cost is very high, but the bottle lasts very long."
79171,1,"I love this perfume and i had been looking for it over the whole country (South Africa). Thrilled that i can buy it from Amazon.One of the most elegant perfumes i know, very elegant, classy yet subtle aroma...."
109696,1,"The fragrance is great and worth every cent, however the scent won't last too much. Maybe because it's not original? Worth 3-4 stars, gave it 4 because the price's good enough on amazon.com"
68566,0,"After reading the reviews for this EDT spray I thought I would really like it. However, not what I was expecting. Exceedingly light fragrance, (I couldn't even tell I had anything on right after spraying it). My husband who notices what kind of perfume I wear, couldn't smell it either. If you're into a fragrance that's so light you can't even tell you have anything on, this is for you! Disappointing."
210339,2,Perfume was clearly not real. Counterfeit. Just to verify I went to a local department store and bought some of the same perfume. The perfume from the department store smelled very different and the bottle was clearly different. I emailed the seller for a chance to fix the problem and never heard back from them. This was a gift for my wife at Christmas. Do not buy from seller. I will also be Leary of amazon purchases in the future. Don't get ripped off like I did.
74004,0,"Like I said, this moisturizer is like any other moisturizer - it's creamy and it moisturizes. I'm not really that satisfied with it, but I think that's because I don't use it much. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has aloe vera and jojobo oil in it and it's organic/vegan, but I didn't give this product a 5/5 because it's just an ordinary moisturizer, it doesn't really do anything."
212733,0,Have used this for the past two weeks. It is a slow process but it slowly has smoothed out the bumps and has shown little improvement for two weeks. Will continue to use for the product does show improvement on Upper Thigh Areas.
56244,0,"I first learned of this frangrance from a co-worker. It smelt so nice, I had to have it. So, my husband surprised with a gift set for mother's day. This fragrance smells delightful. Unfortunately, it does not last long. I apply it in the morning and by mid-day, I need to put on more. :("
179248,0,I like china glaze ok. it bubbles sometimes which i don't like. However I am not a fan of the liquid leather top coat. i've used it a few times and it makes the polish a different color or something. i don't like how it changes the color. I'd go with Seche Vite ... much better and dries really fast.
18202,1,"Pros- It glides through hair well: noticeably less breakage and less hair in brush;there are no ball tipped bristles that get snarled in my thick hairCons-the brush slides right out of the base, and the handle is on the short side.I wish the brush part stayed in the base, I am going to buy some glue to get it to stay in there."
67391,1,"I really enjoyed the smell of the colgne. Im not a real big person on cologne, I own maybe three brands and this is one of them. It is a real deal purchase and you will love the smell it gives off."
99714,0,"To say that this is a ""bad"" mascara would be very untrue. However, because we all have differences in personal style, this mascara is incapable of making every single person who tries it out 100% happy. To me, it is just okay, but to someone who is my complete opposite on the style scale, this may be your favorite mascara. When it comes to my eye makeup, I usually prefer earthy, neutral eyeshadow paired with a very dramatic lash. I like lashes that are long, dark, and voluminous--borderlining on falsies, but not quite there. Maybelline Full 'N Soft just doesn't do that for me. In my opinion, this mascara is for women (or men--hey, I don't discriminate) who would like to look casual during business hours or for teens who are new to makeup and going for a natural look. As far as Maybelline's promise of fuller, softer, healthier, clump-free lashes; I would say that they get a 3/4 rating. While traditional mascaras make your lashes brittle and prone to flaking by the end of the day, Full 'N Soft made my lashes feel as if I weren't wearing any makeup at all--which may be part of the problem, depending on how you look at the situation. When I removed Full N'Soft, my lashes felt healthier than they normally would bare. Also, the mascara delivers on its promise of being clump-free. In a(n)(unsuccessful) attempt to create my more dramatic look, I applied no less than five good coats of this product. While I was silently hoping for at least a little clumpiness to bring the illusion of fullness, this mascara stubbornly refused to tack up on my lashes. Once again, you decide whether that is a positive or negative quality. But when it comes to ""full"", Maybelline Full 'N Soft just did not deliver to me. My lashes were only minimally more voluminous than when I first put on the mascara (I have moderately thin lashes), and it took 3+ coats to make me look and feel as if I were wearing any makeup at all. So for those of you who want only the most natural enhancement of your lashes to get you through the work day or through your first day of high school, I recommend this mascara. But for those of you (like me) who want lashes that would make even the most draggy of drag queens green with envy, I suggest you better listen to your mama and shop around."
170959,0,"I love OPI and have been using it for years. I was on the hunt for the perfect mint green shade for summer and came across this one. I've never used China Glaze before, but see it in salons so thought it has to be decent. It is a very cool color and I love it, but it doesn't last long at all and I will never buy another China Glaze polish. It chips after only a day...very disappointing. Doesn't hold up near as long as OPI."
102556,1,"Have been using this product for years, but it is no longer easily obtainable locally. This is a great hair revitalizer and does not leave your hair greasy. It is definitely reasonable as a jar lasts for a long long time. Highly recommend."

180521,2,"Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said "" tester"" . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors. Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes. Im very unsatisfied and now I know to purchase from my reliable vendor for Angel. Thought I was getting a deal but got hosed."

It took 24 hours for the redness to begin to disappeare2 - When I tried to contact these people America RX - 4 times I called - 3 of which I was hung up on and the 4th I was told to take the product and shove it up my ass! Nice customer Service!3 - I contacted Amazon.com; filed claims; and Amazon stated they would take care of everything fore me --- below is ONE RUDE email I received from AmericaRX - you read for yourself - and ask yourself - does this make any sense and do you want to LOOSE your money to these people should something go wrong with YOUR purchase!4 - I ask you - if you buy a creme/lotion/whatever from the store/pharmacy/online - how do you know 100% it will work until you try it - so the statement made by AmericaRX below about ""we do not accept any used products as returns as in the same way we did not sell the used product"" then really???? I am returning it because it burnt my face, frankly all I want is a refund if they don't want their bad defective product back fine - BUT I DO WANT MY MONEY BACK!5 - Also the statement of ""customer should ""think"" before ordering that product is suitable for them or not"" - really again, how would I know that if I am trying to something - this was suppose to make red veins on my veins fade - it was recommended that vitaimin K creme would help ---- when I typed in on Amazon - this is what came up so I purchased it - but the packaging viewing on Amazon.com from these people and when the actual product arrived are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS! But again, how am I suppose to know if it was ""suitable"" until I ""tried"" it!!!6 - Also - do not let the AmericaRx ""distract"" you --- there is NOTHING AMERICA about this company, their representatives, or their language! Not sure what world I called - but they were beyond rude! Contact the manufacturer before you place an order why - the manufacturer did not sell the product to me or ship it to me AmericaRx is whom I purchased it from and who shipped it to me in their bizarre packaging!7 - So you have been ""warned"" -- now you decide if your face is worth the risk. and hassle of dealing with these people!THIS IS AN EMAIL I RECEIVED FROM SHRIKANTH (AMERICARX) HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS EMAIL/COMMENT.........In reference to order # we are informing that we have shipped out the product ""Jason Naturals Vitamin K Cr&egrave;me Plus - 2 oz""as you ordered for it. First of all, as per our policy we do not accept any used products as returns and in the same way we did not sell the used products also. The customer should think before ordering that product is suitable for them or not. But, you ordered and used the product then wants to return it as it was not suitable. We don't accept any used products as returns. Customer should contact to the manufacturer before he want to place order or use the product.Thank You,Srikanth,AmericaRx."
35792,0,"I've actually had this dryer for a few years. It's okay. It does what it's supposed to do. Not too long after I got it, though, I noticed that the ""ion shine"" switch on the side was switched to off, so I turned it on to see what happened. I continued to dry my hair, and noticed a clicking sound. Looked at the dryer while it was on and saw sparks. Yes folks, sparks. Good thing I don't use a lot of styling products, or I could have had a serious problem on my hands. I still use it, with the ion shine switched off. It still dries my hair like any dryer would. But when it dies, I won't replace it with the same kind."

18005,0,"This is a pretty good gel. It's thick in consistency and holds pretty well, without being too stiff or shiny. I like it."
156404,0,"Yes, it is hot enough, and I learned to adjust the heat so as not to fry my hair (because you can with this), but it is not creating the curl at the ends that I was hoping for. It may be that it is one size too big, but how would I know? Normally one curling iron works for both of my styles. Not this time, and I can't tell you why..... I do have coarse hair, and if you're having trouble with irons that do not get hot enough, this one will end that. If you're looking for a little definition curl at the end of medium length hair, though, this may not be it."
241309,0,I think I was just born with a line/ bags- But this does work to reduce mine- Not completely gone but at night after a long day I wash my face and cut one in half put each piece under my eye n it feels refreshing and cool. Wake up and ma eyes look a little better/ I put an entire one over my eyes.
69857,0,"I purchased these to use on a long overseas trip. It was comforting to have a clean face and body mitt. It was OK for face, but not the best for body. They are soft, which wont bother your face. However, there is no exfliation for body. They didnt try as fast as the other Aquis produts. I also found that using it as a mitt, wasnt too practical. I wish I had brought regular wash cloths with me instead."
197624,2,"I have had this flat iron for less than a year and it is already useless. I turned it on one morning and when I came back fifteen minutes later to get ready for work I found my almost hot flat iron turned off and I haven't been able to get it to work since that day. I really expected it to last longer than 8 months and I'm really disappointed with this product. Don't waste your money, they really don't make them like they used to."

Add more layers for a more intense Smokey eye look.

144487,0,"I've been an Olay user for almost 10 years now, and swear by this brand. In fact, this is the only brand that hydrates my super fussy sensitive/oily skin without making it breakout or leaving it too dry.I used this serum for a week, once a day around my nose area, eyes, laugh lines and frown lines, and put my regular total effects moisturizer over it. It didn't feel greasy, but the areas I put the serum definitely looked greasy, I had to dab extra powder. After a few days, I noticed I was getting breakouts in the areas I put the serum. Too bad, the serum feels good going on, and feels good staying on.So I'm using it just around my eyes for now. If you have oily/acne prone skin, you may want to stay away from this."

24882,1,"So my daughter has a complex about her hair and to appease her I ordered this flatiron after seeing it used in a YouTube video. 1, the shipping was amazingly fast. I thought I would get it a week lasted than I did. 2, my hair has never looked this good straight! I've never used the Chi so I don't know how it compares but I will definitely buy this flatiron as long as they make it. Can't beat the price either but I would pay $200 for this flatiron if it makes my hair look the way it does!"
188571,1,"I was introduced to this eyeshadow as an eyebrow color by a NARS makeup artist, and I've been using it for quite some time now. It takes very little to color my brows, and it lasts a LONG time when used this way. It's the best color I've found for me with my complexion and my red-blonde hair. Blond is usually too taupe, and auburn is WAY too dark. This color is perfect."
92346,0,"The delivery was prompt and the condition of the item was great, but I was disappointed by the actual color of the polish. On this site, it looks to be a very light purple/lavender/lilac shade, but really, it's more of a light pink that you could get at any store."
135578,0,"Not too sure about this product. The first time I didnt notice any changes really, mayeb cuzz I didnt use enough so the next time I had used ALOT, I did notice slight changes but nothing dramatic."
107660,0,"I wasnt expecting this scent to smell the way it does, I bought it blindly just based on the reviews and because the price was pretty good, it smells like alcohol at first, but after i let it sit for like a week, i went back to smell it and it smelled good. I wore it to work one morning and i didnt get a reaction of how good i smell like i usually do when i wear my burberry brit or hot water, but later in the day a couple ladies said i smelled pleasant. So its not to shabby i guess. Nothing i would bend over backwards to get though."
23503,1,"I made the mistake of ordering it on ebay, it broke after 3 months, and because ebay was not one of the authorized resellers therefore had no warranty. But if I was sure it was an excellent iron, for this reason I ordered it from Folica via Amazon. I love it! leaves my hair ultra smooth and extremely shiny. I go the gym everyday at noon and go right back to work afterwards, and this iron has proven to not burn my hair with everyday use. It is light weight, with adjustable temperatures and perfect for my long hair, which is very dry and kinda frizzy. A friend of mine was using a different brand, which was good, but she had been thinking about buying a wider one of the same brand. I let her try mine and he loved it! she order it the next day. I really recommend it with my eyes closed."
99583,0,"This cologne isnt very musky like men's aftershave type fragrances but rather is very sweet and feminine(could easily be a women's perfume). I think its VERY strong and smells best lingering on your clothes than full force and freshly sprayed(in which its annoying like old church lady perfume). Women tend to like this smell but not in the way men want women to like it(older women like it alot). Like I said, lingering on the clothes it smells a bit different(more youthfully masculine and fun)...I personally use this cologne on weekends when I only plan on going to a few stores or working out. I dont regret buying it...it was fairly inexpensive and they give you ALOT. I recommend this for older men who want to smell youthful while attracting older women OR to teen boys who enjoy smelling more sweet like roses than musky like men's aftershave. It seems weird to smell this on all other age groups(including myself...im 25 and I feel weird as the smell doesnt match my style but oh well, weird is ok sometimes)."
199104,1,Great perfume. Love the smell. Long lasting. Amzaon shipped it extremely fast. And got it for an amazing price. Love it.
65769,1,Moisturel is an excellent product. I've used it for years. But this seller(Unique sports accessories-) is too high priced on shipping. In future I will place all Moisturel orders with DERMAdoctor which gives better faster service and lower shipping.
87135,0,"The product and price were excellent; however, all three bottles arrived open with part of their contents spilled. I believe the seller has had this problem before because they were shipped inside a zip-lock bag. I lost maybe an inch of product out of two of the bottles and one of the bottles lost only 1/2 inch. Due to the great price, I wasn't too concerned about the amount lost; however, it was a major mess and I had to clean everything up prior to storing and use. The seller should review their packaging to ensure that liquids can safely make it to their destinations. There was only one pillow pack in the package, allowing the contents room to move around. The reduction in stars is not related to the product, but rather the purchase experience."
133537,2,"i have been using these for 3 months now, religiously applying twice a day and it doesnt work. cheap but wont help."
44506,1,"This has been my absolute favorite perfume since it came out in 1969 and it is increasingly hard to find. Very unusual, light, fresh fragrance - floral, but with a warm note. This is NOT a strong perfume in any of its strengths, so it is impossible to overpower wearing this scent. I wish it lasted a little longer, but it may on different people.It seems so many fragrances from the same maker smell the same these days. This one is decidedly different and a real treasure, in my opinion. If you hate Shalimar (I do) you will be pleasantly surprised by this scent."
181582,0,"I love the color of this polish. It's bright and unique and complimentary to most skin tones [I would imagine]. However, the texture of it sucks. It has glitter, and it makes it really hard to apply smoothly and evenly. It's pretty thick. Getting it off is impossible, you have to use 100% acetone. With that being said, it doesn't really chip easily and stays on well."
160769,2,"Review from a person with skin type: Normal.HEY!!!Have you ever HATED a product sooooooooo much that you just HAD to track it down to write a POOR review? Well this is my first time going out of my way to track down a product just to write a review on it.I purchased this product almost a year ago at a spa in my area, depasquale spa to be specific. I read foaming cleansing gel and paid twenty eight bucks for a darn face cleanser ( yes I know, what was I thinking...well I thought expensive = good at that time) and got home used it and hated it SO MUCH!!!!It's like taking a punch from someone and not being able to do crap about it, writing this review makes me feel a bit better though.So first of all the product does not even foam as name suggested. I had to use like 3 - 4 pumps of the product to feel like there was some sort of soap on my face ( and no my face is not big)... I usually use one pump of a face soap cleanser NOT 4 pumps..... and did the product even make a lather???? NOOOOOOOOOO!!! No lather, no soap suds, no foam NOTHING and it sucks at removing makeup also. I do not wear makeup often but I have also tried washing my make up off my face using this and it did a poor job so I had to use another cleanser.I cannot express to you how much I HATE this product. This is by faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar the WORST cleanser I have ever laid hands on...If this was a seven dollar cleanser I would still HATE it but paying almost thirty buck for this just makes me feel even worse.Crap crap crap crap CRAP!!!!!I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!! UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!!!!"
185779,1,"this order arrived quickly. it was packaged to avoid breakage. included in the package was a recycle bag that can be used for purchases such as groceries. also, included was a sample bottle of Good to Go by essie. i will definitely order from this vendor again."
199334,0,"This is an old scent. I remember this when I was in college back in 1988 and a class mate had this on and I was transfixed on the beautiful smell coming from her. This is a crisp clean scent, I would put this in the green catagory of scents. I perfer the Eternity Summer to this but only because its sweeter and I tend to lean toward sweet scents. This however is a very pleasant scent but my nose has become overwhelmed with this scent for over twenty years now and can tolorate it no more. Its a pleasent scent but quite old in terms of scent life for a marketed perfume."
56928,2,"I have smelled this in the department store and it didn't smell like the one Amazon sent me. I know my fragrances, this is supposed to smell very much like Acqua Di Gio, and it smells nothing like it. I didn't wanna write a bad review but I saw a recent review that says it's good obviously from somebody who doesn't know about the true greatness of this cologne. I felt like I should leave a review because there's may mislead people. The only good thing about Amazon is that they refunded me. Amazon has the best customer service ever, but if you're looking for Just Me, I wouldn't order it here unless you want a stale, expired cologne with very short longevity."
176005,1,"I have very sensitive skin and am prone to eczema...I use Aubrey products and especially this soap...I pour this into a 2x size container with a pump and fill the remaining space in the container with distilled water. I prefer the consistency and have a nice 32oz. supply. It works very well, thoroughly cleans the skin and leaves no residues. Never drying"
163395,2,"The most negative reveiws on this product were right. The brush was NOT soft at all and it was a painful experience to use it for the first time. Then the handle and brush fell apart after the initial use. What a piece of junk!!! Amazon, where is your quality product review/control department? My first product review ever at Amazon because I was never this mad and I was embarrassed to be so stupid to buy this product. It is in my trash bin now and it is not worthy to return it."
175354,0,"I am a fan of NARS creme eye shadow and am a bit disappointed with the powder version. Color is fine, nice neutral, everyday color but I need to wear eyeshadow base to make it work."

198804,0,"I ordered the original scented body oil and received the sesame formula. I was really disappointed. But now that I have used the oil, I like it too."
52893,1,"I love this. I received it as a gift for Christmas & I wear it daily! I always get complimented on this scent. It is ""ME"". I can't say enough good things about it. I plan on purchasing more soon because I am running low. I have not had a signature scent in years. I am so glad I was given this."
906,1,"I love this product. I blew out my last one and couldn't find it in local stores. Ended up buying two similar type stylers and hated them. I was thrilled to find this product still available online. I have wavy and frizzy hair and no other styler offers the kind of gentle smoothing and frizz control as this one. Because you can also use it on dry hair, if I'm caught in a drizzle and end up with frizz, I can touch it up in a hurry and look 'salon ready' for anything later in my day.Should add that the product life was likely shortened because I used it in Europe for 6 months and even with a converter, I think the unit got zapped."
11948,1,The Clove Mint Zum bar is my favorite of the soaps! The scent is so gorgeous and soothing..and the lather feels like silk ... you come out of the shower so relaxed and moisturized. I love it!
61043,0,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my husband mainly because it was described as having an alarm but it DOES NOT have an alarm.
65911,0,my female friend loves this scent..however way too feminine and sweet smelling for a man to wear..U can smell a hint of gin and tonic but the flowery scents overpower this.
68934,2,"I recently purchased a Ouidad package. When it came in the mail, the conditioner had spilled out all over everything. I emailed the customer service staff and they responded it was the fault of UPS. Okay, well that could be the case IF the package was dented in any way. It was not, so I told them the conditioner must have left their facility with a loose top. They denied it, and were rude. Needless to say, I did not get to try the products yet, but regardless, I won't be ordering from them again. A customer should at the very least, leave satisfied, if not happy. I was neither."
185877,2,Wish I had read previous comment. They again have sent the wrong thing. I suggest you do not order from them if you actually want this product.
5546,0,Its not the same as it used to be it didn't cover the same and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't nearly as light as I hoped.
68331,2,"What I wanted was not what i received. They tricked me into ordering what i could have purchased right around the corner. The white labeled bottle that they are showing here is not what i received. The white labeled bottle is the older product thats hard to find and it is much, much better than the new gold labeled bottle that is supposedly the exact same formula or new and improved but it is not. The product I received from here is sold at every sallys hair supply store on the planet at a lower cost than what it is sold for here. I feel raped. and I believe the people selling this knows this. otherwise why are you showing the white labeled bottle and sending the gold labeled bottle. I would like my money back or the correct product because this is some BULL!!"
19859,1,"My hair is so awful. Half curly, half straight, fine but tons of it. I have to tried so many different leave ins, smoothers and serums so that I can style it to look decent. This is the only product I have ever used that makes each hair shaft respond to heat styling.It's not stiff, it's not just a 'softener' so that it's soft but won't hold a style... it's just perfect. Doesn't weigh my hair down and styles instantly - no fighting. My hair is in long-ish layers and I like to style it kinda fluffy - this stuff is exactly what I've been looking for."
161320,1,Pro: Retractable cord and folding handle are very convenient and easy to store. Not too noisy.Con: Actual product looks bigger than what I expected.
186484,0,"Goodhouskeeping recommended this product. They said it really took away fine lines, etc. I bought the product. It has a very nice texture and feels good, but there was no reduction in fine lines."
68929,1,"Curly girls rejoice! Use this product on wet hair and let dry naturally.... NO FRIZZ, it WORKS!!!Highly reccomend, I have baby fine wavy hair(very prone to frizz)this just lets the hair curl and wave with shine and no crunch!!expensive, but worth it, worth it."
157727,0,This heated eyelash curler was recommended by a friend. I've tried it a couple of times and still need to practice. One of the suggestions that I read that has worked for me is to apply some mascara FIRST and then use the curler.
144082,0,"This is a usual acne treatment , I purchased this as it said it was a scar treatment. Most acne solutions work differently for different people , having understood that , this cream is a salicyclic acid treatment and focuses only on ACNE and not on SCAR"
150200,2,"I had a horrible reaction to the NEW formula. Burning, redness, hot skin like a bad sunburn. Went away after a few hours but was quite painful. Used this lotion for years and had no problem. Wondering what went into the new formula that might have caused this. Has anyone else had similar experiences?"
19846,2,I am so disappointed in this product. It is not the Biosilk serum I buy at the stores. It's completely watered down and has way too much alcohol. What you can find at the stores feels different and stays on your hair. This feels like a nail polish remover.
203032,2,"I know Midnight Cowboy is one of Urban Decay's most popular colors, but I can not figure out why. This shade has way too much glitter in it. It doesn't stay put, even with the primer potion. It gets absolutely everywhere besides your eyelid. It gets on your cheeks, your hands, and even in your eyes. When you look at the eyeshadow, it has a nice champagne color. However, the color doesn't show up on your skin, only the excessive glitter does. I highly suggest using Urban Decay's matte eyeshadows instead. They work much better without the trashy glitter."
19239,0,"This makeup does not offer a lot of coverage. put too much on and its EXTREMELY visible and looks cakey. Does brighten skin up, however, if you have naturally clear skin. Should not be used with dry skin because it will enhance this even if you moisturize"
182312,1,This color is absolutely eye-catching. I love how unique it looks and how it catches everyone's eye. This polish applies shiny then dries matte for a very unique look.
43784,1,"This hand creme smells great and really leaves your skin very soft. I first used it at my mother-in-laws and fell in love with it instantly, so much so I bought 4 of them. I would recommend this to everyone, but you do have to like the Pomegranate scent."
91547,0,"Or does this perfume smell like mouthwash? Somebody actually gave this to me for my birthday. I couldn't believe it. Anyway, mouthwash doesn't smell bad, but still. I was expecting maybe a light floral scent. I'll probably give this away to one of my younger cousins."
27868,1,"This product is great. I've been having some problems finding stuff like this where I live, when they were always readily available before. I've been using it for several weeks, and I have to say it leaves hair very soft and shiny. Hair has stopped falling out and looks very nice. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of his/her hair. It is a great product. And shipping was super fast!! Gotta love that part also!"
112809,1,The bottle sprays a fine mist of water instead of doing a stream like some spray bottles. I've had no problems using it.
183936,0,"The soap does leave your skin feeling clean, although it really doesn't set itself apart from other alternative choice/boutique soaps, such as Dudu-Osun or Tarocco. I havent really noticed any upgrade from those two in particular, which i use regularly. In fact, with the Dud-osun especially, i have found that this Jericho bar doesnt compete well at all...it doesn't clear your pores as well, although the drop off is admittedly negligible, which brings me to my two main issues with this soap, given that fact. Price and scent....it cleans almost as well as the aforementioned two brands, but is priced higher ($8 for this 4.4 oz bar vs the same $8 for Tarocco's 5.2 oz bar or $10 for 4 Dudu-osun 5.29 oz bars). Additionally, this soap actually smells like mud, which cant be said for any other one i've tried. That isnt really pleasant, and i feel for the price, there should be some sort of compatible aroma outside of just simple mud scented. For all those reasons, i knocked two flippin' stars off my rating, but three stars aint bad, and reflects the quality regardless of how poorly it stacks up next to other similar products.So, I'm not trying to dissuade you from trying this soap. It is very good. I just feel you will find plenty of comparable soaps that are more pleasant and less expensive. Personally, i expected more out of it."
110469,1,"My mother-in-law first told me about this product and bought some for me to use. I have been hooked ever since. It not only dries my nails faster, but it also gives them an extra nice shine. Definitely recommend it."
212362,1,"I love Satin Color, it's not harsh on your hair and never dries it out. I've used this product for 4 yrs ,it's Great."
170636,0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."
126829,0,I expected more from this gloss then what I got. It doesn't go on the best and isn't very sparkly. Not the best quality. If it were cheaper it would be more worth it.
242407,2,"I have loved this fragrance for forty years. The last bottle I bought was near the end and I no longer live near my fragrance shop. I saw it on Amazon and thought &#34;yeah&#34;! It is nothing like the wonderful scent it should be.. There is an unpleasant, metallic sort of finish to the scent. I looked into returning but found it couldn't be done. I am stuck with an expensive bottle of disappointment."
112240,0,"I guess I should have read the reviews first. Thist is not Aloe Vera Gel. It's just watery aloe vera. Like the stuff you can drink as a supplement. Disappointing. I wanted something that would soothe my adult acne, but sadly, this just fell right off my face. Amazon shouldn't call this aloe vera gela when the bottle just says ""aloe vera."""
239144,2,I ordered a bottle of Aqua Di Gio from the seller DOLE PERFUME as a christmas gift. It was painfully and embarrassingly obvious that this is a fake version of the cologne. The smell is nowhere near the same. The ad did not advertise this as being an imitation anywhere and I am more than disappointed. BEWARE!!!
129091,1,"i always use different products every month because i can never find one that i like enough to stick with. when i bought this...i put it on every morning after washing my face and just after 4 days my skin was glowing and healthier looking. i then got the ""visibily even"" face wash and even though iv always had problem-free skin now just after 2 weeks using this stuff my skin has become even more radiant, glowing and healthy looking."
206003,2,"So i just bought this product, just to try it and see if it actually worked. I got home and was excited to play with my new toy. I tried to put it in my microwave, but sparks started flying! I was horrified, especially since they claim that the container is microwave safe. Just to be sure it wasn't just my microwave acting up, i put a cup of water in it, and nothing happened. I tried the container of wax again, and the sparks flew once again. So i cannot tell you if this product works, because i can't even heat it up to try it.Sally Hansen Eyebrow, Face & Lip Wax, Microwaveable"
154232,1,"I love this product. It does everything you want it to: disguises blemishes, evens out the skin tone, creates a good foundation for further makeup, gives the skin a warm looking shade, and stays looking natural all day long. It doesn't melt off your face in the heat, or rain. This makeup isn't not shiny or sparkly either. I've encountered several foundations and bases with shine or sparkle intended to make your skin have a ""natural shine, or glow"" and it just looks bad. This makeup looks completely natural looking, as long as you get the right shade (try and test a little bit if you can) for your skin tone. Just I don't think this would be the solution for acne. It will cover a couple blemishes but it's not really meant for acne. I'm really glad that I bought this makeup though, it's worth your money, and you'll be happy!"
42189,0,I have sampled this product in Saphora and it was so much better than the bottle I received through this vendor.I believe this bottle is either old or not the real product. I am very disappointed but the scent is still one that remains on the body for over 4 hours and is not unpleasant.
191770,2,I have used this product for five days and my skin is severely red and irritated. It provoked further breakouts and the areas that aren't broken out are red. Don't buy!!!!
164145,0,"I bought this after an accidental siting at a health food store. I saw this on a lot of womens fotki hair albums and they swore by it. I had reason to believe that this would work for my hair because a lot of women w/ my same texture loved what it did for their hair.My hair is REALLY thick so I am heavy handed when it comes to oils and pomades so I really slathered this one on. Unfortuantely this really did not moisturize or condition my scalp, add shine, or improve the condition of my hair. My scalp sucked this up, within a matter of hours my scalp was dry again, like I had never put any on to begin with.On the plus side I did see some extra growth as a result of the horsetail which conains a high concentration of natural sulfur. Besides the growth there was nothing special enough about this product to make me purchase it again. I still have a third of the jar left.fyi: my hair texture is 3c/4a/4b"
19553,2,"The powder has a sheen to it and doesn't apply as good as the Pyscns fourmula I get at the store. I have mixed bare minerals w- other mineral powder to diminsh this sheen look whick added cakey-ness. Although it has great coverage, the sheen and cakey-ness made it seem not so natural looking. I'm very surprized I didn't care for it after I've heard so many grat things from other people on the infomercails.thanks for the quick shipping and great price...regaurdless of my feelings of the product itself.Kim"
227843,2,"I know it's called intense red but man is this color INTENSE. wayyy too intense. Think bozo the clown but with a more cherry hue. I felt like when I looked in the mirror I looked at my hair before I even looked at my face. And when I walked PAST a mirror all I saw was red red red. Dont get me wrong, I love different and funky but not this dang bright. This was too much. My suggestion to you if u must see to believe? Buy some color oops at cvs beforehand and have it ready to use in case u feel the same way I do (which is what i did, only I didn't buy it beforehand)."
187966,0,"This was the first ceramic iron I used. Good for first timers since it is inexpensive and does a nice job. It doesn't get as hot as some, and doesn't heat any faster than a regular iron."
162005,1,my wife loves it and the night light is very nice. she uses it every day and finds it really works good
101684,0,I love the opi shatter. Teenage dream is a nice color but its very very sheer and hard to tell you have it on but it is very sparkly and shiny and looks pretty on. So if your not looking for a very sheer color do not order it or just use it on top of another color.
120486,1,"This mineral makeup is great for people with problematic skin. I have a few skin disorders that create redness, dryness, and reactions to the sun and heat. When applied in the appropriate manner and after well-dried moisturizer, this product (which is the only I have found with a shade light enough for my skin) covers beautifully and locks in moisture while still allowing my skin to breathe. I usually don't apply the powder to my nose, the one oily area of my face, but when I apply a finishing powder after the mineral powder, it covers my nose. I can't use the rice setting powder from Youngblood though, as it is too drying, but this mineral foundation is wonderful!"
190908,0,"I should have listened to the previous reviewers. This curling iron is so big that it straightens the mid section of the hair and curls like a blow dryer on the bottom of the hair. It heats up very quickly and it holds my hair. However, I was looking for loose curls. I suppose now I am going to give the 1 1/2"" curling iron a try."
103591,1,"This is a great heavy-duty quality tool. It has a good weight in your hand when using it. If you have ingrown toe nails and don't want to go to the podiatrist to get toe surgery, this is the next best thing. It is a unique tool that you will not find in any kit. As a runner I can't say enough good things about this tool."
151674,0,"the brush was not of typical OPI quality, it had a few bristles sticking out oddly. Love the color though."
27038,0,I really like the feel and the long lasting affect of this aftershave. My wife says she likes the fragrance.
198112,0,"So I bought this exact one from Amazon and used it for exactly a year, but then it broke. It just stopped working. Like others have pointed out, the warranty is void if you purchase it through Amazon so you have to take your chances I suppose. Before it broke it worked perfectly though!"
90341,1,"My hair felt awesome after the application of this product.I used ""Golden Brown"", and it covered my gray.Next time I'll use ""Golden Blonde"", for more ""blonde"" color as opposed to ""reddish"" golden brown.Surya Henna Cream left my hair very silky and in excellent condition.I left it on my hair an hour with heat. I kept the plastic cap that came with the product because it really retains the heat well.This product is .... sooooooo good!I LOVE it!!"
129691,2,The item pictured is not the item I received. I love these rollers and I wanted the exact same thing when I reordered them. Instead I got them with plastic clip ons instead of metal pins. The plastic clip ons don't fit in the roller case and don't hold the hair as well. They are a nuisance to travel with. It took awhile to track down the people who sent this to me for a refund as there was no receipt included in the package. Too bad because the original rollers are great.
6677,2,"This hairdryer was nice enough while it lasted. It was small and lighweight, and did a good job of drying my hair quickly and without frizz. But I bought it on January 10th of this year, and here it is April and it's already dead. If it had even lasted a year, it might have been worth the price...but three months? I'll never be buying one of these again."
64626,0,"I HAVE NOT HAD TO USE THE PRODUCT FOR LICE, AS I GOT THEM UNDER CONTROL. I HOPE I WILLNOT HAVE TO USE IT FOR THAT CONDITION, BUT WILL TRY TO USE IT FOR CLEANSING"
119198,2,The actual brush is good but they fall off after a few uses. We have found this common with any backbrush we have purchased. Now we just take the brush off and glue them on with crazy glue or liquid nails.
92945,2,"The worst hair color product I've ever used!! This didn't cover any of my grey, and I only have a little at my hairline and by my temples. The scent is overwhelming! So bad, my eyes watered and it took my breath away. I color regularly so I'm aware there will be an odor but this is unreal. It was also difficult to saturate all my hair. I will pay a little more and go back to John Freida foam, a bit more money but a much better product!"
239995,0,Works great heats fast easy to travel with since it has the lock on the side flaws tips get extremely hot
209182,0,When it came I noticed it was too dark for updating my hair. so I never used it but I never sent it back. perhaps someday I will use it.
239236,2,"I have used this Hermes product for years. I was a bit suspicious that this was the genuine product, given the price, but I gambled anyway. It is clearly not the real thing. Although the fragrance is similar or the same, the longevity after application is maybe an hour. The real Hermes product has a fragrance that lingers all day after a very limited application. You can spray and spray tons of this stuff, and the fragrance will only last an hour or so. Therefore, you're better off spending more and buying directly from Hermes, as their real product will last much longer. This product is a complete fraud."
101699,1,"I have both the white and black shatter nail polish. I absolutely love them both! I would say black is more for light colors or bright colors, but white is definitely flexible with some lighter, softer colors and bright or dark colors! Long lasting and adds a cool effect to your nails easily and without the need to go to a nail salon as often. (not that us girls would mind going every week, right? Haha)The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it kind of cakes up after quite a long time and many, many uses. Nothing that would keep me from buying again, though.Overall, definitely worth a try! And you get quite a bit of product for the price too!"
248085,0,"I have been wanting this set for a long time and now that i have it....well, the fragrance is very good but not long lasting."
146487,2,"I used this faithfully for ten months. My hair has been thinning a little for 2 years. I did not really notice any thicker hair, possibly a little???? but not much if at all."
59246,1,"I LOVE this soap! I use it for shampoo, shaving, body wash/soap, laundry, cleaning, and hand soap. I bought foaming soap dispensers and it works great! For shampoo I use it full strength but I don't need much at all! I am happy that the ingredients are organic and I LOVE that I am supporting an AWESOME company! I have other Dr. Bronner's products (chapstick, leave in hair cream, hair conditioner, other scents of the Castile soaps) and I LOVE them ALL!"
218420,0,"Well, I ordered this because I must have seen the infomercial on TV a trillion times already and they finally broke me down enough to try it. I didn't dislike it, but didn't notice any difference in my hair from using my regular shampoo and conditioner. It's too expensive to buy again, but I would certainly do it if they ever start selling it at a cheaper price - it takes less time for sure and the smell is pleasant. It left my hair as shiny as always and it felt soft and manageable too....but then again, my regular products do the same thing."
127949,0,"Love it, its light has a vanilla scent, it's not a winter perfume its a summer perfume. I am giving this scent 3 stars because it does not last long on me, but its worth the try"
3119,0,"Ungaro III EDT is one of the most unusual & interesting scents in my collection. I find I neither love or hate this scent; just unusual.I don't often wear this fragrance.At first application, an explosion of booze aroma heralds my olfactory senses. The dry down settles into a dark, melancholy, earthy, spicy, very masculine aroma. If the essence of Gothic could be bottled, Ungaro III would be it. I recommend Ungaro III in cooler weather as an after-hours or an executive boardroom fragrance.Sillage is moderate, and lasts about 4-5 hours on me before fading. My wife neither likes nor dislikes the scent, but whenever she smells Ungaro III on me, she's reminded of an exotic witch doctor or Papalois from Haiti. My body chemistry doesn't seem to mix well with Ungaro III.You will be noticed when you enter a room wearing this fragrance. It doesn't smell anything like Aqua Di Gio, Cool Water, or Creed Aventus. It's exotic & dark, with an aggressive, confident, no holds barred, take no prisoners persona. Ungaro III will boldly announce your presence. I interpret Ungaro III as an Alpha male scent."
114343,1,she loved the perfume; never had it previously. I told her there is a reason why this Chanel has survived in popularity for so long.
99008,0,"Maybe I haven't given the eyeliner a chance yet, since I've used it only three times. I've used liquid eye liner for MANY years. So, trying the pencil liner was a major change for me. It seems awkward to use. The need to pull on my eyelid when applying it makes it hard to apply properly. After it's on, it does gives a nice effect. It also cleans up better than liquid. But all in all, I don't think it's something I'd purchase again."
61139,1,"Firstly my face is very sensitive, acne prone, and super dry! Especially because now that the winter season is among us. For my first week or two the smell of roses was a little much, and I thought because it was scented my face was going to react and I'll end up with a rash or breakouts, it didn't! I'm saving up to purchase this product again because I just ran out =(p.s A little goes along way!"
239256,0,"Was not pleased with color. Hard to tell real color on screen. Oh well, I'll use them sometimes."
202177,0,"The pluses for this thing are the price, the length of hose, the price, the flow control switch, and the price.The minuses are that it's cheaply made (reasonable because it's cheap), it's a bit tough to maneuver because the hose is stiff, and min arrived with a crack that looked like a manufacturing issue and cause a small stream of water to spurt out the side.Seeing the defect drove me back into Amazon to search for a replacement. If you don't mind spending a bit more I think there are better values to be had."
53638,2,"Electrical cord had short at swivel end. Worked intermittently, returned for credit. Ended up buying similar at Walmart that works!"
214718,0,"These rollers work OK, but not great. They don't seem to get hot enough to do the job. Even after 30 minutes of heating, they don't feel really hot to the touch, and the curl doesn't stay in the hair. It does create a soft curl, but it doesn't stay. I'll stick with my curling iron."
80475,0,"I love this cream. Rich and healing, absorbs quickly and is effective. I like all the products I have tried from Jason Natural and am convinced I am going to try more."
247631,1,Got it very quickly in proper packaging and its genuine composition and quality. Adore this perfume! Recommend this online service!
9246,2,"The clips were an attractive selling point for me, but they do not hold well, and they leave a line in my hair on every curl. Not good, not pretty, not what I want. Returning this product."
70043,0,"They should have shown strips of what the color would have looked like on certain colors of natural hair, just as they do on their color wheels, in stores, or at the very least, as the company shows on the side of their packages. BUT L'Oreal Hair Color has been my choice to take a bit of the summer red out of medium brown long hair, SINCE I WAS 14 and my ""Grand Mere"" told me that only slatterns and women of the evening had MY color before I colored it. Also, coloring in the darker shades, uses only 20 volume creme activator, which make thin hair coated with color, shine, and gives it volume. COLOR YOUR HAIR A DARKER SHADE FOR SHINE!"
190214,0,"I bought this after reading all the reviews here in Amazon and ratings in some other websites. This is a good perfume, but is a bit overrated. If I apply it in the morning, I get the smell for a couple of hours. I think, you get what you pay for. It is definitely worth the price."
19383,1,"i have combination skin and occasional acne. this powder foundation gives me coverage and a glow. i get lots of compliments on my skin tone!also, the full size lasts a LONG time, so if you're comparing prices to drugstore brands, definitely give this a try.the only thing i don't like is that my pores look more obvious when i'm wearing this."
79574,0,"Shipping was SLOW!! But the shampoo itself is wonderful. Nice fragrance. Leaves my hair silky and shiny. I would buy again, but not via the net."
27855,2,"I was very disappointed in these toe separators. They are flimsy, uncomfortable and basically it's better to spread toes without anything than with them."
182350,0,"I do like the nail polish but the color is SO metallic it ends up looking a bit grey. The formula is also very very thin, but I like it. I prefer it to something to thick. the coats will dry fast so nothing to worry about. its a nice color, I just wish it was more black rather than grey. A good buy. I would recommend it, but not for a black nail polish. maybe for a dark metallic grey."
195415,1,Great hair dryer with lots of power. Had the same dryer for many years. Bought this one as a replacement.
233334,0,"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it."
29837,1,"For many years, i have been impressed by the quality of Spornette brushes, and this one is typical of their standards."
148812,1,"I used this without bleaching my hair and it still looked awesome. But, it fades after the first wash, so that's a bummer."
210717,1,"10 10 10&#8217;s across the board if I could. I&#8217;m so happy with my order. It seems like I got it within two days no lie when I only paid for standard shipping. The pictures were spot on; it was a perfect match.My only problem is on me. When shopping on Amazon, I can&#8217;t figure out what other items the seller has to offer for the same product. I don&#8217;t like having to order the same things, in different styles same prices and pay 2 different shipping fees. Once I learn that, I will become loyal to one seller for a particular product.Thanks so much for my gifts."
101247,0,"The silver shatter is a good decoration to nails, but it doesn't shatter well. I have used this twice and it just looks like silver polish over the base color. Maybe it's because I put it on too thin. The black shatter is so much better than the silver one. Maybe I will use a thicker coat. Hopefully that works."
107807,1,"I absolutely LOVE this perfume! I have never smelled anything like it and have also never had as many compliments as I have since I started wearing it. Its extremely sexy yet classy, and feminine without being flowery or over-the-top. It is definitely not a ""trendy"" scent- I imagine I'll be wearing it for life, as it is a classic scent and good for women of any age. I can't think of anything to compare it to since its very unique, but its definitely a warm scent with tones of vanilla, possibly orange blossom and is slightly musky.Its very differnt from the pink bottle which is the newer version of the perfume, and much more of fruity. That one is just ok, the black bottle is SO much nicer. The problem is in the packaging...the black bottle comes in a pink box and the pink bottle comes in a black box, so make sure (if you buy this elsewhere such as in a department store) that you know which one you're buying and definitely go for this one - the black bottle- its amazing!"
178151,0,"This cleanser is all right. I haven't noticed any significant difference in my complexion since I started using this regularly, but it's nice enough, and better than nothing."
154167,0,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
40346,2,It has parabens in it. It did okay as far as dandruff goes. I think head and shoulders is better and doesn't have parabens in it.
233351,2,"As I mentioned with the other Zoya color, Regean, this color is nice, but it's not OPI! They lack shine and consistency. The product started out okay, but I found that the more I exposed the brush to the air, the polish started to thicken and clump. It's added to the polish trash pile!"
140337,0,Since my last bottle of Paul Sebastion PS cologne was wonderful. It had a clean crisp scent that always reminded me of a fresh clean morning. That bottle lasted me years as I used it sparingly. Recently I purchased a new bottle and even as it seems to have basically the same base- THEY HAVE ADDED a spice to it that makes it now smell (to me) like a cheap drugstore cologne. I no longer use the stuff. I wish they would have left it alone. Thanks
231971,0,"This stuff works, but Alpha Hydrox's Enhanced AHA Creme works just as well (despite being a slightly lower percentage of AHA), contains more (2 oz vs 1.6 oz) and costs several dollars less. I've used them both and find the lower percentage a better bargain."
105343,0,"The machine does a good job of blocking out noise but doesn't always block out snoring, the reason I bought it. I still like it...but it hasn't totally solved the problem. Also, they didn't send the Nature noise CD with it...and I forgot to complain to get the Nature CD sent to me separately. If you can make that happen, that would be great!!! (There was also no coupon for the CD which I thought might be the other way they were going to handle the Nature noise CD.)"
63256,2,"I have used the serum for over a month now. I don't think I am in the target age range, and therefore am not seeing results. That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.My true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle. The product is too dense, so that it sticks to the walls, instead of settling on the bottom to be pumped out.I have had to shake and pound this tiny vessel and pry it open to redistribute the product, as well as just scoop it out. The bottle is by no means empty either! I still have over half the serum in there.Badly, badly designed. I will not be buying this again for that reason. Too bad I bought a two-pack!UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes. The only product I was using in that area of my face was the Eye Lifting Serum. I have NEVER reacted this way to any other product before. This is definitely a product with pitfalls."
230155,0,"I was picking between the Face & Body and the HD Invisible Cover, and unfortunately went with this one due to its better ratings on MakeUpAlley, despite my already having tried the HD Invisible Cover with pretty awesome results. The foundation appears really runny, and unevenly pigmented. I did try shaking the jar before each use, but that doesn't help much. What's worse is that there is almost no coverage whatsoever. Whatever I put on my face seems to vanish. I don't have a whole lot of blemishes, but I was really hoping to get a more even skin-tone with this foundation. Sadly, I don't get it. I may go in and exchange my Face & Body for an Invisible Cover instead."
96653,0,"I have very normal skin and live in a humid environment (NYC). I've always used a tiny bit of Cetaphil lotion on my face but wanted something lighter for the summer. Argan is definitely light, and can be thicker as you put more on. There is something astringent or intense about it (which must be what everyone is talking about when they mention a ""glow""). If you are used to treatments on your skin this may feel like nothing to you; for my very tolerant and calm skin, this is too much to use every day. I haven't seen any benefits, though it does feel very good when you put it on. Having it as a straight oil means that I can experiment with different combinations to find if there is a way that it can work for me."
154564,1,"this is amazing, I love the way it applies my liquid foundation...flawless , great product...it can be somewhat hard to clean all of the foundation off from it."
8936,2,"need more slim dispenser on this product than hole bottle at once, yet with a smaller size of application with same economy of scale."
50805,0,"Both curl and body doesn't last as long as they state for me. I'll use it occasionally. Delivery for this product was super fast, would buy from then again. Caruso C97953 Salonpro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter With 30 Rollers"
69350,1,"I received this perfume as a gift from a friend of mine. I really like the scent. As it is an Eau de Toilette perfume, it does not last that long but it does smell good..floral with hints of jasmine. It is a great perfume for everyday use, and also for evenings out."
45178,0,"I purchased this for someone who loves the scent but can no longer find it in stores. It came wrapped and sealed with plastic however, when opened, the recipient could not get the top off to spray the perfume. She had to unscrew it and remove the sprayer to use it. Good thing she loves the scent but I was somewhat embarrassed."
59648,2,"This soap sucks. I hate the scent, and it doesn't work . I also do not appreciate the religious writings on the bottle. I am not against religion, but I feel it is my choice and I resent it being 'shoved' at me on a commercial product."
99195,0,"The picture of this cologne shows a box and a lid. I ordered this as a Christmas present and it came with no lid and no box. I felt like I was giving a stolen item as a gift. The price was right, but I would only buy this if you are keeping it for yourself and not giving it to someone else."
60825,2,"i bought it for my 4 month old son who has what seems like a severe case of eczema and dry skin, so like every concerned mother i have been trying and testing out any product hoping it will help his skin,or suits him best, unfortunately this one didnt work on him like i expected, moreover it made him smell a bit girly,the sweet almond oil reminded me of an asian indian sweet store LOL!but the packaging was nice and pretty, tiny like travel sized, and smells sweet ; if you have a little doll :)"
219818,0,"Like alot of women I used this cologne years ago then all of a sudden it dissapeared from stores. I was just thrilled when I came across it online so ordered it right away. I was dissappointed in it when I received it...just not the same as it used to be. It does not smell as good or last as long but, I also found the musk perfume oil which has not changed!! Just wish you could get it in a bigger bottle!!"
114464,0,"I love the smell of tomato leaves, and I was hoping that this perfume would smell just like them. Answer-- not really. There's a little bit of an herbaceous, leafy sort of smell, but it's combined with kind of a generic floral scent. The smell is okay, I'm just disappointed that it's not what I was expecting."
201323,0,"This is a great body wash, but I was a bit dissapointed because it does not make much lather/suds, so I find myself using lots of it! Great scent though!"
13190,1,"I have been looking for sponges like this in stores and could not find one anywhere. This sponge holds together, where others fall apart after using a couple of times. Great product!"
118683,0,This product is good it is very shimmery though defiantly not what someone would want if they are going for a more natural look finishing look. I don't use as much on my face as I wanted to with a finishing powder. I would recommend just putting it on the top of your cheek bones to catch the light and have a pretty shimmery glow. But you don't need that much if that is all you want from this product then you could just get a smaller size a little bit shows a lot with this product
4018,0,"Don't get me wrong, I think the smell of Lacoste for Men is nice, I just don't think it's anything more than that. I bought some a while back and instead of it being one of my 'signatures', I typically wear it in situations were I'd like to smell nice but not use one of my more expensive colognes. All in all, it's a decent smell but I can see why Lacoste decided to leave it behind. Give it a try, you might like it more than I do, I just can't help but think about how many other fish are in the sea when I smell this though."
131298,0,"If you are looking for a Wen like product this is not it! You must follow up with a conditioner. This lathers and is strictly a shampoo. I was disappointed to find out I needed a conditioner. I can't use Wen because of the almond oil. The HairOne knock off gave me a horrible reaction. I used Wen for a long time until I realized I was having issues with my allergies.I read reviews on this and I'm sorry but those that compared this to Wen either have not used Wen or they don't understand how Wen works.Right now I'm giving this 3 stars. It left my hair tangled and I used a conditioner. I'm waiting on their masque. It did leave my hair soft but I'm not sure it is any different than my current products. My ends are dry and I was hoping this would fix the issue. Maybe with more time.As for the lather, I honestly think it is too much. The product doesn't seem to have enough moisture to be called a conditioning shampoo. The lather seems to pull out moisture. Again, I'm going to give this more time and will update if things change.The product smells like Ivory soap."
209528,0,"Great smelling cologne but horrible longevity. You'll get 3 to 4 hours at most out of this cologne, what a disappointment. I must admit though for a relatively inexpensive cologne you definitely get a bang for your buck. overall it is OK if the scent lasted longer it would be my favorite cologne... But it doesn't."
232023,1,"I'd used the Alpha Hydrox brand in the past, always with great results, but never the 12% solution. Here's the thing: When you put this lotion on you can actually feel it working. There's a mild tingle/burning sensation. And within minutes you can detect a discernible difference in your skin's appearance. If you're looking for a product that tones your skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and fades dark circles under the eyes, look no further. This stuff is inexpensive, a jar lasts a long time, and it works absolute wonders."
73187,2,It worked fine for 2 -3 weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop. I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again. Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together. Very frustrating. Go get a professional dryer. it might cost a bit more but it'll work! And probably for a long time!
73149,1,Really like this scent fresh and not too overpowering can't wait to order the full size next time around.can't stop putting it on
62016,2,"I bought this product for my dating on this weekend and I odered by 2 days shipping. So I got this before the weekend. However, it is NOT the product explained by the seller. I odered 4oz but it actually just 1oz. Also, it is not the same product with the picture. I'm feeling like terrible. It seems like mess up my dating with my boyfriend. I'll refund this product!!!!!!!"
179317,2,got it done at a salon added two more layers and unless you dont shower or wash your hand or do anything then maybe it will last. n dont waste you time with harderners it did not work on this polish n and with a clear coat. color looked nice then 3hours later into doing things around the house like cook and wash hands lol it all cracked off in pieces
251959,0,"I've been using this product on and off for a while, and I can say that it is my favorite, although it doesn't perform miracles! but I've found that it works better than more expensive creams, and maybe my body is just hopeless! It does increase the skin's tone with just one application a day. I recommend it! At least I'm not getting worse! I feel like I'm doing something to fight cellulite, without spending too much money..."
180488,0,"I regularly use Alba's lotions so was excited to try this. I've been using it for about a week and like it--it smells good and has a nice lather; however it's left terrible soap scum in my shower. I'll use the remaining bottle, but will be cleaning a lot more often until it's gone."
85664,2,"After rave reviews online and watching the success with another child (5yr) at school, we had plans to stop our daughter's (3.5yr) thumb sucking in one long weekend. Following the advise, I applied just a little to her thumbnails to start. We checked on her, and there she was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, so before nap the next day I applied a little more. She didn't nap. That night I applied a little more on both thumbs. We were wondering why she wasn't waking in the night, until we found her in the morning sucking on her thumb like it wasn't covered in the most bitter foul tasting nail polish ever. We told her we would take her to Chuck E Cheese if she could make it through the weekend. What do you do when your child can't taste in their sleep? Can anyone taste in their sleep? She wants to stop, but as soon as the lights are out a robot takes over her arm and guides that thing straight to her mouth. Her teeth are messed up and she can't pronounce the 'k' sound. Since we've tried band-aids, I don't think any type of removable guard would work either."
245401,2,I tried it out but got no good results. It also made me break out which was not good.would not recommend
16889,2,This comb is excellent for three days. One end broke off the fourth day and teeth began bending and breaking soon after.
63029,2,"These things were SOOOOO painful! The arches in my feet are high, but not that damn high, good lord! I took the blue middle section out, and they STILL hurt like hell. They're just not for me...at. all. I've gone back to wearing my old pair. I'd hoped these would work as an economical option, seeing as I no longer have health insurance, but no sir! I'll just have to live with my old ones until I'm properly covered again in the future.I'm now trying to decide what to do with these new ones...I guess throwing them away is my only option. Oh well."
23990,1,"I try new shampoos all the time - have used drugstore brands, Kiehl's, Aubrey Organics, and many many more, but I always come back to Aqua Glycolic. Leaves my hair cleaner and looking better than anything else. I don't use it as a body wash except when traveling - too expensive for that, and I'm perfectly happy with Dove soap."
133912,0,"I love the color that it gave me, it's gorgeous!! BUT It get's all over your skin, which I have yet to get it all off, gets all over your shower everytime you wash your hair it looks like somebody has just sprayed blood all over your shower and it's just awful. I really don't like that part."
215279,0,"I love Freeman products. Loved them even more when they were called ""Totally Juicy."" This is still my favorite scrub on the market, but it definitely dries my face more than the old product did. More abrasive too..."
179079,1,FAST SHIPPIN PLUS IT WAS AS PICTURED one thing is when i wear it those haters gone be GREEN WITH ENVY
192532,1,"I absolutely love this product!! I used it throughout my pregnancy. The jar goes a surprisingly long way. I'm not sure if it was the belly butter, or my skin type (delicate white), but I developed not a single stretch mark. My baby is now eight months old, and I've continued using the belly butter as my sole facial moisturizer. It works amazingly well, even on my older skin. Mornings I rub it in well, in fast circular motions, then wait a couple minutes before applying makeup. I use it at night, and wake with my skin still moisturized and lovely. The texture of this butter is wonderful and the sent is subtle and nice.(If you're buying this as a gift, don't get it from MaisonDrake. My order arrived with a huge white barcode label stuck over the front of the Motherlove label. Carefully removing it left a terrible sticky dark residue that won't come off, even with rubbing alcohol. I can't give this as a gift now and will have to get another from Whole Foods, and I'll pay the extra few dollars.)"
228221,2,"Let me tell you, first of all on Amazon,this product says Clairol on it, however, when I received it it did not. When I used this product today, I tried to wash it out and it would not wash out even after 5 shampoos. My hair is full of thick grease. I have to wear a shower cap on my hair tonight and try to wash it out once again tomorrow with another 5 shampoos which will probably, in the long run, do more harm than good! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WHAT EVER YOU DO!!! Also,I lost a lot of hairs today due to this thick grease!"
125379,0,I LOVE this bronzer but I am on my third one now - apparently it is defective and the makeup cracks and breaks inside the case. Take it back and they should give you a new one..
121550,1,"Okay any eyeliner you use is going to dull, unless you use it sideways? All mine dull and it's never been a problem. But what i really want to point out unless anyone else has the same problem as me. When i wear eyeliner under my eyes it runs down and i look like i have raccoon eyes and i have to wipe under my eyes 30 mins after i put it on. This Mary Kay eyeliner doesn't do that. It's unbelievable and stays on all day I LOVE IT! so if you have the same problem i do then you'll definitely want to try this!"
217514,2,"Another reviewer already mentioned this, but let me emphasize: THE CURLS DO NOT STAY! I'm not sure what its maximum temperature is at ""30"", but that's where I curl my half-asian hair at, and by the time I'm done with one chunk of hair, the previous chunk is already straight again. One time I even used my husband's glue hair gel hoping it would help my hair stay curly, but the temperature on this iron is just not high enough. I thought the issue was my own thick hair, but when I got my hair done for wedding pictures at the salon with their iron, my curls remained intact overnight!Also, my hand does spin the temperature dial accidentally ALL THE TIME. And no, it does not stand on its own.Conclusion: I am shopping for a new curling iron right now, because this one was a terrible investment."
61742,0,"I thought this foundation would be good, something different that would stay on through humidity and long days. The first time I tried the foundation, I did not blend it correctly and it looked grainy and whiter than other patches of skin. I tried to blend it, but the thick consistency did not allow me to do so. I ended up trying to take it off but it was very hard to get off, especially with a cream cleanser. The Alabaster is way too white for ivory skin and I ended up looking sort of vampirish - if you blend it well enough you can tone that down. It does not cover small spots well - it did not cover redness on my cheek and when I tried to use extra foundation to cover it, I could not blend it over my imperfections. This foundation is very thick and very grainy. Think of putting caulk on your face. It seems to get a little mask-like in consistency. I did not like the small toothpaste tube it came in. I would not be beyond ordering the Portofino color to give it a second chance. I thought maybe it was because the color was all wrong. The reasons I would give it a second chance are because I have no doubts that it would definitely stay on all day, even through humidity. There is no bad smell to the makeup. Blended very carefully it does make the skin look smooth and perfected. Additionally, I partially blame myself for buying a color that I believe is too white. This is not for people who want a sheer, natural coverage. If you are scared of it not coming off or being hard to get off, you would not like this either. Durability and stability are important for me because of the different hot to cold conditions I'm in all day and for sweating. This is very different and takes a certain amount of skill to blend in just right. Not recommended for most, but if you need foundation with staying power, be sure to pick the right color."
166635,0,I'm just a student at a beauty school. I saw this vacuum stand mannequin head holder and thought it was a little high but I need one and thought the color look pretty nice so I brought this and then when I receive it in the mail it was a dull looking turquiose color. It was not the same color on their advertise picture.
125222,0,"This hair dryer has 3 different settings to dry your hair, i don't seem to notice a difference on any of the settings- I think its more of a light show than anything. It does get my hair dry pretty fast. The only negative that I have noticed about this dryer is that the back of the hair dryer clogs up with lint quite often and it did not come with a filter to help block that out- easy fix by using a hand held vacuum cleaner to get the lint out."
5726,2,"The lotion itself is perfectly fine. The biggest problem I have with this lotion is the smell. It is extremely overpowering and lingers for far too long. A good example is a few hours after applying the product a friend of mine was able to smell it on my hands while standing 3 feet from me. The smell persisted after I had applied the lotion before bed, and woke up the following morning, and I'm not talking about I could smell it a little bit, I'm saying my hands reeked of cocoa butter 8 hours after applying it.I would only recommend this product if you really, REALLY love Cocoa Butter."
162278,0,"Used the whole container, but couldn't discern any visible change. Cream goes on easily, feels nice, and smells good...but I wouldn't buy it again."
103519,0,"The soap lasted me just TWO WEEKS, contrary to what was advertised. I also didn't notice any improvements while I used it, I have used other soaps that worked better. Maybe I didn't give it enough time?"
33928,0,A life saver when I was overseas. I still don't remember what happened to my other one. I was thankful for amazon.com for selling my color!
94881,0,"It does what it is supposed to do. However, the product is really creamy and a bit messy when you apply it. It is also difficult to control the application of this product to just the hair and not the scalp. If it wasn't so messy I would have rated it higher."
131204,0,"The product separated not long after I received it in the mail. Water came out of it after several uses. I had to shake it vigorously for a minute to make it usable again.Didn't make a bit of difference in the appearance of my eyebags and circles. It's a temporary brightness after application, and that's all."
115327,2,"The fragrance of this product is not even remotely anything like lavender. It was difficult to use,as it arrived caked solid, not in pellets as pictured."
178287,2,"I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer. I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse. My face is red and dry now because of this. Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks. My face was doing great, clearing up before this. Waste of my money, but I guess it's all about trial and error. I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,"
188694,0,"I'm not sure if it works or not. It does smell good however. Main issue is the bottle. I mean, could they make it harder to get out?"
101308,0,"very strong scents! one spray is more than enough. might be nice if mixed with another more mellow scent. i like the peony one the best but wish it wasnt so overpowering. i do not like the violet scent and the lily is just OK. not as good as other thierry mugler perfumes, like ALIEN (my favorite) or the original ANGEL."
80977,2,"I bought this product hoping for an alternative to the aluminum based ones normally used. It worked fine for wintertime when I only had desk work to do. However, with any amount of activity I found myself needing a deodorant. I ended up throwing the stone away in search of something different."
68365,1,Dove Essential Nutrients Cleansing Cloths easily removes my makeup and it doesn't dry out my skin. When I travel I like to take the individual packets with me. I can no longer find them at the stores so I searched and purchased them online. I'm stocking up while I can!
228497,2,this is an old set. This is NOT the current Miracle Set Packaging. Go to Marykay.com. You can find a consultant near you.
245498,0,"It is unfair for me to rate this product because it may have become frozen while it waited in a package on my doorstep in Minnesota for a few days before I opened it. It is now rather runny, possibly as a result. I'll try it again later."
240281,2,I used the 2 shades darker formula to get rid of the winter pallor on my legs. The change was not subtle at all. It looks like my legs have been at the beach for a week: way more than 2 shades darker. The color is OK...where it went on evenly. The tricky part was the application. After the first application I saw spots that I missed around my ankles and knees (and some dark streaks which I scrubbed off) so I did a second coat. I'm happy my legs are no longer bright white but I'm not 100% enthusiastic about the product because it is so hard to get the application right. I don't know if there is a way to get a perfect sunless tan at home. But I'm not throwing this out yet because it might turn out to be the best option.
247681,2,"At first I was pretty happy with this purchase. It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.The other day while shopping at a department store, I saw this cologne at the fragrance counter. I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!) and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine. The single spray also lasted longer than the 2-3 I usually use.I'm seriously starting to believe I received a knock-off. The price is almost too good and the scent isn't as good as the stuff from the department store. Amazon should look into this."
189530,2,"Aside from them not being as sharp as described before purchasing, there is a lot of friction between blades that hinders proper usage. I guess you get what you pay for!"
250742,1,Love the mirror. A great value. Fits on the wall perfectly. Others I looked at were much more expensive for the same product.
23194,1,"this stuff is incredible! all natural collection of oils and vitamin E are soothing and do not upset my sensitive skin. works wonders from head to toe: teensy bit to calm flyaways, after shower moisturizer while skin is still wet, eye makeup remover, undereye moisture, eyelash/brow conditioner, cuticle repair, callous softener, massage oil. LOVE IT!"
245680,1,"After using this hand cream, I only have good things to say about it. I like the smell and the way it made my hands soft. I will buy again."
199925,0,"This blow dryer is ok. Doesn't seem to get hot hot just warm. Also, a bit on the heavy side. It does not have a retractable cord either, which is a feature that will be a ""must"" on my future dryer."
217342,2,"I bought this shampoo from ""ezee llc"" which now seems to have the name ""lindasproperties"" and it was NOT the correct product that I have been using from Bumble and Bumble for years. It did not smell like the original product at all and it had a different color and texture to it. I returned it right away and now I just order it from Bumble and Bumble directly - they always have deals on their site and often have free shipping, so it's probably worth it to know you are getting the correct product and that it hasn't been tampered with."
124193,1,"Ive only used it twice so I cant say much about the product ,yet,except it didnt make my hair fall out. I was very impressed with the delivery. Got it within 24 hrs.. Thanks. Will extend my comment for better feed back of the product, since I believe that's what this comment should be about but I need time to see its magic :)"
154742,2,"The dryer works great, although I would have liked to use it safely at both speeds.Note that (according to the instructions) the dryer switch must be in and remain in the ""low"" operating position when using 250 volts... Too bad!"
48655,2,"The Mr. Pumice ""stone"" was a waste of money. It didn't work, dropped a lot of granules and made a mess. The block felt like a piece of flimsy styrofoam. I would not recommend this product."
217731,1,"Love this product!! Leaves my skin feeling soft and moist. Does not feel heavy, sticky or oily like so many other products do. I'll never use anything else again! It is the only one my granddaughter will actually use. She is a fair-skinned redhead who burns easily and is outdoors in the California sun most of the day. This is the only sunscreen she will use on a daily basis."
136662,0,"I was desperate to accelerate my hair growth after a disastrous trip to the hair salon (I wanted an inch off my medium long hair...she cut it to my chin) and after doing some research I decided to purchase this product. I had read numerous reviews saying that it made people's hair shed more and it was drying but I decided that my hair would be able to handle it. I used Nisim for about 3 months and did not see any results and it did in fact dry my hair and scalp out a ton. Dandruff was never a problem for me before but now I have constant itching and flaking and on top of that I was finding shed hairs all over the place. Every time I touched my head hairs would come out. I decided to stop using the product and have returned to my normal shampoo and my hair is improving but I feel upset that I wasted money on something that left me at square one. I give Nisim Fast three stars, though, because many have said it does work for them and though it did not work for me, I do not want to say that it does not work for everyone."
219138,0,"I purchased this product a few days ago. I find it to work well. The attachments serve their purpose. The Candal smells nice and the music cd i find to be quite relaxing. The foot brush works well to. The peppermint lotion is cool as well. However i feel that 2 AA batteries (not included) are quickly consumed by the hand held unit. (Keep more on hand) Maybe a larger battery compartment is in order. But, all in all if find this product very effective and nice to use."
94827,2,"I have used the Paul Mitchell Detangler for years. It is the only product that keeps my long thick hair snag free. It has always worked so well. This is the first time I did not buy the product from a hair salon and I am extremely disappointed. The bottle I got from Amazon is not the same product. It smells horrible and it is a different color. The Detangler should be a yellow color. The one sent from Amazon is white. The bottle I received even looks different. It does not look like the bottle pictured on the Amazon page nor does it look like a bottle found at a salon. Yesterday I went out and bought another bottle from a salon and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love. I wouldn't buy it from Amazon again. If you shop around at the mall, you can find it even cheaper. I went to three places and found it for $13 (all others were at $21)"
191219,0,"I bought this dryer at a local store, and 3 days later am packing it back up in the box to return. I really like this dryer, but man is it heavy!!! Too bad, because my hair looks great after using it. Although I really like the cord keeper feature, the cord is too short for me. I like the heat this dryer blows out, but often it gets too hot, so if I have a necklace on it burns. If it wasn't so heavy, I'd keep it."
48511,2,"The diameter is actually 7 inches with a 2 inch border to make it the advertised 9 nine inches. The mirror fogs up as soon as steam develops in the shower. It took too long to arrive, and it turned out to be worthless. I am disgusted with my purchase."
62548,2,"It states on the site that the Revlon Eterna '27' costs $19.99 for ""6 ounces;"" however, the box states only ""2 ounces."" BUYER BEWARE! If it is 6 ounces for $19.99, it's a good price, but not for 2 ounces."
225070,0,The thing I dont like about these rollers is that they get too hot to handle. They also don't seem to hold a set as well as my old rollers did.
193997,0,I like china glaze ok. it bubbles sometimes which i don't like. However I am not a fan of the liquid leather top coat. i've used it a few times and it makes the polish a different color or something. i don't like how it changes the color. I'd go with Seche Vite ... much better and dries really fast.
48727,0,"I got this item in a small and possibly unwarranted fit of panic over a bit of loose skin under my chin (I'm 39 but regularly get mistaken for 25, so this was not a welcome sight). I decided to follow the instructions for ""international customers"" for the neck area on the DVD (NuFace is not FDA approved for the neck or body) and used it for about 3 weeks. It did uplift the area I was worried about, and improved the look of my skin, but I also found that it overstimulated my thyroid gland. I could feel some discomfort swallowing after use of the device and I developed symptoms related to overstimulation of the thyroid. I had to stop use of the NuFace and I did feel better so it was luckily only a temporary situation. Of course, after about a week of dis-use, the skin pretty much went back to the way it was before. I would only recommend at the most that this be used under the chin/jawline but not further down the neck as the DVD shows. Personally for me, I dont think this is a product that I can comfortably use long term due to the worrisome side effects. I'm going to look into creams and facial yoga or something else that may take longer to work, but will be better for me in the long run."
182887,0,Maybe a 3.5 but no more. I read and re-read the reviews and I though this would be a wonderful Nail Clipper but the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper is just okey. Sometimes it is a pain and have to find other angles something I never dealt with much cheaper clippers. I will give it praise for the looks for it does command respect. For performance so so. 3.5 Stars.
21686,1,This was my first Zoya nail polish. The formula was good - 2 coats for complete coverage. The halo sparkles were more subtle than I expected and it does require a top coat to keep the glassy-shine. All in all a good polish.
202689,2,"This used to be my favorite self-tanning lotion so I didn't believe when I read reviews like mine. Until I bought my own. This items is no longer manufactured, so the bottles being sold are old and do not work anymore! Although the bottles do not have expiration dates on them, the chemicals get old and no longer build color. It is just like using a lotion that smells bad because it gives you no color at all. Even if this used to be your favorite, DO NOT buy it now. It is not fresh and does not work. Do not waste your money."
165654,2,I was informed by message this was new. I received package in bubble wrap within box; the lid was not on and the perfume leaked. The perfume was old!
6287,0,I had this dryer a couple of years and it worked well. Kept the filter clean and used it daily. Eventually the dryer started emitting sparks into my hair. I rated it a three because it was a good hair dryer when it wasn't trying to catch my hair on fire.
46305,1,This clock is a nice addition to my eagle collection and an arrowhead eagle plaque I have owned for years.
180776,1,"This hairdryer works really well. I like using the diffuser. I had a hard time finding a diffuser to fit my conair dryer, so I just bought this Vidal Sasson set, which was inexpensive and very satisfactory."
96800,0,"I use this daily, but am not seeing much of a difference, unfortunately. Will keep looking for the best face tanning product."
19620,0,"Let me give you a background of my skin-type. I have combination skin with occasional break outs. My skin gets oily towards the end of the day as well. My break outs were getting worse and so I decided to make changes in my facial products. My best friend and mother kept telling me to get BE as it would clear up my skin and look lighter than my liquid foundation. I tend to wear a lot of make up and I'm used to this. I am more comfortable knowing that my skin is covered.So I was not impressed when the friendly woman at Ulta put BE on me as I could still see all of my blemishes. I did like how the rest of my face looked. The make up does not cake up in my smile lines and gives my skin an all around healthier look. However, I still have to put on cover up before BE (and sometimes after). I don't see the point in spending $63 on make-up that doesn't cover my imperfections. Also, I got the matte foundation as recommended and my skin still gets oily. If you have good skin (as my best friend and mother do), this is great make-up for you. If you need more coverage try something else.I am still hoping that my skin improves with time and BE will be enough."
58516,2,"Purchased this dye at a health food store for $15.99 believing it was all natural. In the matter of 15 minutes it started burning my scalp. I am suppose to keep this on my head for 30 to 45 minutes because of heavy grays. Rinsed hair, hair felt stripped of its natural oils, was tangled and noticed clumps of hair in my hand and sink. Well thank goodness for the conditioner which took some of the tangles but had to do a second treatment with my coconut oil. Once I was done with my hair project I decided to do a little GOOGLING and unfortunately this product isn't as safe as you might be led to believe. Will not buy again."
153829,2,"I have never had dandruff problems with my hair, and I have used all sorts of products over the years. After using this conditioner for less than a week, I suddenly have flakes! I will not ever be using this conditioner again, and I am sorry I spent the money on it in the first place.Maybe you'll react differently, but I would never suggest using this product!"
155215,1,My toenails have bothered me for years and I was needing some relief from them being ingrown. I had been thinking about having the nails removed for good. Then I saw these on Amazon and ordered them. The toenail clippers were a little smaller than they looked in the picture but after getting them out and using them they were just the right size. My wife trimmed them for me as I am too fat to reach them and what a relief. This is the first time they haven't bothered me since I can't remember when. I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again or recommend them to my friends.
152744,2,"I develope some stretch mark due to gain and lost some weight. I used this product religiously every single day and all the way. There is no difference between now or first day that i used this cream. Same stretch mark and NOT a change. This product didn't work for me. So i give one star because it did not deliver what it suppose to do, HEAL OR REMOVE STRETCH MARKS. I will use Nivea Q10 cream instead."
10932,1,"Have been looking for this fragrance for a long time. Last time I used it many middle aged women(cougars)approached me and asked me what it was. I was really surprised and wanted to buy more of it, but Macys was out and the manufacturer was not distributing. Recently, after two years, and much to my surprise, I went on a search for it and found it on Amazon and ordered two bottles. Guess what, I still get women asking me what I'm wearing and of course my wife tells them, ha."
76335,0,I guess the under $5.00 price should have told me that it wouldn't be a good replacement for the mustache comb that I had. This one is so fine toothed that I can't even get it through my mustache. Instead it just pulls and tuggs on the hairs. The scissors are a bit flimsy and not very sharp.
157106,1,"I LOVE IT. EVERYONE I GIVE IT TO LOVES IT. THIS SOAP IS SO REFRESHING. IT'S ALSO VERY ECONOMICAL, THIS IS A HUGE BAR AND LASTS FOREVER. HARD MILLED SOAP."
104127,1,Received item quickly and also responded to my questions about the product very quickly which allowed me to purchase the product faster.
48916,1,"I used to wear a cologne no longer produced named SPACE 21st; SPACE 21st smelled exactly like the title ""from outer space"". It mixed with my body chemicals so well that it made me emanate extraterrestrial smells. It was an extremely good smell and received positive comments from females. I was really bitter after finding out that SPACE 21st was no longer being produced. I had a hell of a time trying to find a replacement. What I was looking for was something that smelled light but very noticeable (not strong and in your face). ROCHAS is the one; it's another one of these extraterrestrial blends that is the perfect alternative to SPACE 21st. I also must mention that ROCHAS smells similar to JOOP but it distinctly is not JOOP. The ROCHAS smell matches it's product design very well and the color maroon. If there was ever a smell that represented the color maroon, ROCHAS is it. If you've never smelled ROCHAS and are relying on this review, trust me, you will thank me."
174581,1,"It's a nice fragrance, but I don't get the vanilla scent in it. It smells more like a floral musk to me. It's a scent suited for more mature women. Still very nice. If you tend to gvet headaches from floral perfumes, this one will likely give you a headache."
7662,1,"This is a classic perfume. I believe that White Shoulders is one of the first fragrances produced by Evyan of New York City in 1945. It is a classic floral perfume. I sprayed this perfume on myself many years ago and I was hooked with its rich smell and I discovered that the fragrance lasted all day.I was nervous about purchasing it again since Evyan was sold to Elizabeth Arden and I had used up all my ""Evyan originals."" So I took a chance and bought it through Amazon. How pleased I was when I discovered that the formula was not changed and bought it at a great price.This is an incredible fragrance and I always get compliments when I wear it. No, it is not an ""Old Ladies"" perfume ANYONE can wear this fragrance."
113399,1,My wife says this is the best hair dryer in the world...............her hair is about an inch long...........how would she know? but this particular unit replaced an identical one that got dropped and broken..........she's happy now..........so am I.
243829,1,"Good presentation. Excellent quality. The product arrived very quickly. the Benzoyl peroxide is a very good substance to eliminate acne. So I am satisfied with the purchase, because i bought a good product."
10351,1,"I like this product alot. I agree with one of the other reviews written. I gives a great shine for the first day, after that it makes your hair a little greasy. As, long as you apply it wet, then dry & flat iron, you can't go wrong. It looks great every time."
220625,1,"Product is awesome. I love the vanilla accent. It's not too strong, and you dont have to spray it on every 15 minutes. Only problem I bout the .17oz and for some reason I thought it was much bigger than what it was when I got it. But nonetheless it lasts a very long time!! I had it for about 4-5 months now and I only used 25%"
242823,1,"This is my favorate of all the perfumes Liz has put out other than Black Pearls. The two are the absolute best as far as im concerned. This perfume I call my ""Money Perfume"" because it smells like American Money to me. I just LOVE LOVE this perfume and reccomend it to everyone!!!"
242435,0,"This hot comb is really not for me. I have thick, coarse hair. It straightens my hair out and keeps it that way for about 6 hours. If I go to bed, wrap it up, and try to comb it out the next day after having curled it, it looks HORRID. It is a crying shame that I've used it, spent my money on it, and now have to shop for another comb. At the least, it straightens my roots. At the most, it's just another failed tool I bought to help myself out. Maybe it will work for other people. It has done little to impress me."
58399,0,"Decided to try this because I heard that Lactic Acid was supposed to be good for women of color.My thoughts on this product: Eh....It's ok...works alright.I was surprised that it didn't do a whole lot. I figured ""What with this being 70%..."">>shrug&lt;&lt;I know that it's weaker than Glycolic but I expected something better. With glycolic the results are immediate for me, i.e, smooth texture, radiant appearance, improved clarity, gets rid of acne, etc...But then again--I don't know the pH of this Lactic solution so I figure maybe it was kind of weak (i'm guessing).I can see how it may work for others and for that reason I gave it 3 stars. Maybe ppl with sensitive skin, or first-time users, etc... could get some use out of it.Personally I prefer Glycolic Acid. Although I have been using a glycolic/lactic 35% combo (ph of 2.1) that came along with my kit (and found that to be quite effective), I may just go back to full Glycolic.In any case, I have dry skin but I must exfoliate DAILY with a scrub (or I will break out) so I figure maybe this is the reason why the Lactic didn't meet my expectations. I used to have my peels professionally done and my aesthetician used (glycolic) 40%-45%. I am 28 years old, btw and no I am a sporadic peeler so I haven't built up a resistance or anything like that.UPDATE (24 jan):This is pretty good. I received this in December and I wasn't impressed with it at first. But--I ran out of my salicylic and decided to try this again instead of the glycolic/lactic combo.I figured, ""Well--I bought it...might as well try to use it.""I wouldn't put this over glycolic but it did work very well."
89037,0,"I purchased this color hoping I would finally find the right kind of ""gray."" All the grays I've always purchased end up being either too blue or too white and streaky. Unfortunately, this was too blue. The picture was definitely misleading, since the nails look much more gray than mine did. Maybe with a slight undertone of blue, if even that. But, the color I received was definitely blue. Maybe, it was just my bottle? Looking at some of the other reviews though, I don't think so... Also, the application of it was a little streaky. I definitely needed to apply three coats.Whenever I wear it, people ask what kind of blue polish I am wearing. The only gray I ever see is when the lighting is dark, and there is a ""pearl"" effect which gives it a bit of a gray shine. If you're looking for more of a light blue with a hint of gray undertone, this would be perfect. It has a nice pearly shine to it too.Otherwise, I am still on the hunt for my perfect gray."
87816,1,"A little expensive but it works. I really like the good rating of the product in terms of the chemicals, if your into that stuff."
28988,0,"I like shower gels that make my skin feel hydrated after I get out of the shower... this one didn't deliver. It's a 3-in-1 combo (shampoo/bath gel/bubble bath) which I usually stay away from but it was priced right and Philosophy is a pretty good brand. Also, I know it's pink so I didn't expect it to smell masculine, but it smells really girly."
45844,1,"I don't know if it has slowed my hair loss because I'm not keeping track. It cleans my hair really well though, squeaky clean. Also, I feel better about myself since at least I'm trying to stop hair loss."
88746,1,"I've never been much of a cologne wearer until recently. This was a recommendation by a colleague. I liked the smell immediatley...subtle and masculine which is exactly my style. I was also suprised at how long it lasts. I workout during my lunch breat at work and I can still smell it after running three miles and showering (and i do not spray it on my clothing).Overall, this is now my favorite fragerance."
186153,2,"When I received this product and opened it, you could tell that it was not new. I don't mean used, I mean old. This is a problem with perfume because it loses its scent and goes ""bad."" That happened with this product. It is quite astringenty and nothing like the original scent. In fact I wore it only once before I just decided I wasted my money."
37107,0,When curling my hair I keep pressing the off button and I don't see a way to lock the keys. ANd overall I have used better curling irons
65309,1,"I tried this cleanser when it was on sale and I had a coupon. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is, I figured I'd try it if it was cheap enough. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprized and would buy this again even if it wasnt on sale and I didnt have a coupon.This is a very light, foamy cream that works well with or without a wash cloth. It cleans very well, is light feeling, leaves my skin feeling soft and even takes off waterproof mascara.I have my son using this also and he has sensitive skin and as a teen an acne issue. This doesnt bother his skin and had been a good cleanser even for acne. My son uses a perscription acne cream so I didnt want a specific cleaner for acne as they contain active ingredients on their own. This has been a very good choice for us both.I have tried other cleansers in the past, many that cost much more and I can't remember the last time I was this pleased. I will continue to use it"
61858,0,I wanted a very large round brush. This brush is just way too big. Really cumbersome. It ended up being a waste of money since I've used it and cannot return it. People who think the bigger the better should reconsider. There is too much brush to control and it ends up being more of a pain then it is worth. That said - the quality of the brush is good. I may buy a smaller one from the same company.
60031,0,Item did appear new and is a pretty color. Can use wet or dry. Probably will not repurchase. Shipping did not take as long as expected from the UK.
164899,1,I recently bought my Hot tools curler and i love it alot!!! I can set the heat setting to the temperature that i want and it all depends on i want my hair to be curly. Great tool if you are looking for to create those loose curls.
204712,0,"This product is okay. I'm able to use it once a day otherwise it dries out my skin too much. I'm not seeing the results I was expecting after about a month as far as clearing (adult) acne.I purchased this product because of the awesome rating and reviews, but I can't say I've seen much of a difference (yet?). It's worth a try for the price though."
246394,2,"Definitely not a ""satin"" eye mask. This product is made of cheap canvas, and is poorly produced in China. Much lower quality than expected, I would not recommend this item."
158723,1,"I am sad that my local natural food market has seen fit to stop carrying this product, even after repeated requests, so was thrilled to find it here. This is the absolute best soap for sensitive skin that I have ever used. It doesn't dry out your skin, even in cold weather, has minimal lather (which I appreciate), and smells divine! The Neem component seems to be the magic."
78333,2,"I purchsaed two bottles of this Surya Henna, followed their directions and none of my gray hair was colored. This may work for other women but not me!"
249800,1,"I use this cream at night time, it is my second jar, first one was purcchased at skin center and more costly at skin center. Use a little and enjoy it immensely. Md forte great products."
56462,1,"I have curly hair that breaks off often. I can not stand when I put my hair up in a pony tail (wet) and every hair it not in place. This is the only gel that satisfies that to a ""T."" Not only that, it adds a beautiful sheen and texture to naturally curly/frizzy african-american hair."
89660,0,still using the cream. the jury is still out. The dark circles are still there.
32846,1,"These Frownies are not exactly sexy. But they DO work. I had a deep line from knitting my brows together and it is now gone. Yes, it does take some time for the results depending on your skin, how deep the wrinkle is, and also being very consistent with using the patches.Frownies also made me aware that I was frowning and I retrained myself to be more aware of it. No more line - thanks Frownies!Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!"
54100,1,"These rollers work really well for me. I have thick hair and curlers don't usually hold. These, however, work great on my hair. I have been using them as a second day option to make the style last. I also love the wire clips, they don't leave an indent in the curl. Great product! Only negative for me is I wish there were more rollers in the set, I have a lot of hair so I will probably purchase another set so I can do all of my hair in one shot."
89599,0,"I expected this to smell really good from the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with the smell it was too sweet and something else was mixed in, it was not a good match for me."
1049,2,Not happy with the product. It made my hair split and it lasted only 6 months.
145159,0,"If you need the applicator, don't get this kit. It says it comes with it, but it doesn't. All I got was the powder and the solution. The solution bottle is bigger than my old bottle, so I can't use that applicator."
120602,2,"I was very disappointed in this product. After an hour, my face is oily and the foundation begins to separate and look terrible. I will stick with the loose minerals, as they don't contain all of the binder and additives that cause the makeup to look awful so quickly."
196961,0,"This is not a real Chi flat iron and does not come with a warranty. The swivel cord is very awkward and hard to work around. It does get hot quickly like the real Chi but because it is fake I'm not sure if the plates are real ceramic and cause less harm to the hair. It did come extremely quickly however, in like two days."
172433,0,"I just turned 24, so I'm not very old, but I'm starting to see the first signs of fine lines around my eyes and a smile line on one side of my face (so weird it's only one side, right?) so I decided to give this night cream a shot. It's very fragranced and it bothers my boyfriend who's sensitive to scented creams. Doesn't bother me, but for those who are sensitive to that kind of thing this isn't the best option. It doesn't completely absorb so your face is left feeling slightly sticky and is that way even the next morning. I used this product for about a month and have seen no visible reduction in my fine lines, so I will probably discontinue to use it. Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
149283,0,"Very absorbent, dries quickly, and very light. The sticky, ultra-absorbent texture is annoying to work with, feeling a bit flimsy and even cold. Instead of a quick rub-down, I nearly have to pat myself dry - otherwise, it would probably dry me off quicker than a regular towel.If I were carrying my own towel somewhere, I'd probably choose this because of its effectiveness. For daily use, I'd choose a nice towel, or even a regular towel, over this one."
70117,2,"Avid cyclist looking for a solution to sweat in the eyes during those warm days. Ordered this and after one ride I can say that it's not going to cut it. The weather was only in the low 80's and I was sweating very little, but the headband was saturated in a very short time. Once saturated, it's worse then not having a headband because it started to drip on to my glasses. I do not recommend this product to any cyclist who sweats more then a hummingbird because you'll find yourself unsatisfied and riding blind."
35709,0,"I purchased this for my mother last x-mas, and she was far more excited about the emergency-car-escape tool that can easily fit on her key chain. A much better gift would be something from L'Occitane, as that gift (for someone else) was remarked on several times. Bees are nice, but go for the octane."
11400,1,"As with all purchases, I bought this device expecting it to be about half as good as its manufactorer claimed, and about twice as good as its detractors claimed. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works very well, indeed, if used according to the clear instructions sent with it. I have seen progressive benefits from its use, done with patience, and am very much taken with it.The people who have lambasted the machine in reviews here have either gone into it expecting instant gratification, or have not taken time to read and heed the method prescribed. It works over time, as it is advertised to do. Have patience, and you will be as pleased as I've been.The Panasonic Pore Cleanser works for me where nothing else has. Period."
156884,2,"I just colored my light brown hair with this...carefully made sure it was evenly distributed, etc. I waited 25 minutes (probably a little longer) and washed it out, eagerly anticipating a head of coppery hair like on the box. Was I disappointed. You can't even tell that I colored my hair. It seems to have lightened it a half shade, other than that, NO RED/ORANGE color AT ALL. So angry. What a waste of time and money."
196088,0,"First, this works well. It's infinitely easier than that eye shadow type coverup that takes forever to apply. This stuff goes on in about 15 seconds. Then a minute or two to dry and I can leave the house. I also noticed that even if I'm sweating at the gym, it is not dripping down my face (I was worried it might but it doesn't.) It also does not drip in light rain. It does come out once soap/shampoo is applied.I brought it to my hairdresser who has been working with me to grow my hair back (bosley, vitamins, stuff like that.) He looked at the ingredients and was pretty surprised, said the ingredients are not good for me and definitely don't leave it on my hair overnight. Only use once in a while so I don't clog my scalp pores with its contents. Bummer. I was appreciating some normalcy using this stuff. Even felt sexy one night for a party with my hair looking decent."
155344,2,"bought on recommendation of Dave Ramsey,not impressed with the advice, writing, or examples...also the religious tie-ins were too frequent and out of context."
194470,0,its a very streaky and thin. i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage! i get so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter. still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)
202587,2,"I bought this product because I was looking for a natural mosquito repellent and this had good reviews. The whole family sprayed this on and were covered in mosquito bites. It's almost as if it attracted them. I don't remember ever getting bitten up this bad using nothing at all. The more we sprayed on, the more we got bitten. A complete waste of money."
78505,0,"The product did leave my hair softer and shiny without looking overgreased and feeling heavy. I admit that initially the smell had me worried but when I applied the product, I noticed that the smell sort of disappated. Overall I would rate it above average but wouldn't give it the ""it's the only product I'll every use again"" line."
216220,2,"This towel is not effective for thick hair. It works no better than an ordinary good terry towel. I was looking forward to a product that actually saved significant time by wicking away moisture from my thick wavy medium length hair,but this didn't even come close. Perhaps if you have short, thin hair it might work, but not for my type. Also, it isn't long enough to securely keep in place when you wrap a turban. My advice: Do not spend the money."
180528,1,"Purchased from amazon, Product appears to be authentic however 2 bottles arrived both with imprinted code (country of orgin ? ) removed from bottom of box and replaced with a silver sticker to match the box and cover up where numbers had been removed. The Serial numbers on top of the bottles had also been ground off, Therefore making it impossible to authenticate. Caveat emptor....."
207450,0,"Okay - I was going to give this two stars, but I'm giving it three because it shipped SUPER fast, which was great. Also, I really like the bottles and tips for application - I really never was a fan of the cones.HOWEVER - I think this henna was old or something, because it did not create dark stains at all - and I followed the instructions to the letter.Will never buy premixed again - going to just get the pure henna powder from now on and deal with the mess!"
55280,0,"It doesn't work on all kinds of acne and you have to use it at just the right time before the pimple forms in order for it to work. But if you can accept that it's not perfect and are ok with the fact that it may not work with some acne, it's worth it."
87461,2,"I have worn Pink Sugar for over a year and love it. I bought my first bottle at Sephora and loved it, had no issues. When I first started using this bottle, I didn't suspect anything since it does smell the same to me, but I am allergic to it! I break out in hives every time I wear it and this never happened with the bottle I bought at Sephora. Obviously something is in here that wasn't in the original. I came back here to search to see if anyone else noticed anything off and there are a couple of other reviews that also say it's fake."
18992,0,"For some reason, this makeup is very different than the exact same product I have used before. Maybe it's a bad batch? But it doesn't seem to cover at all, which is what I have always loved about Bare Minerals Foundation in the past. The right amount of coverage without looking heavy. So I'll buy again, but maybe directly from BareMinerals or Sephora."
245695,1,"First the product is called a ""hand cream"" but I think Neutrogena should change the name to Moisturizer Cream because you can use this stuff on any part of the body - even your lips. As for the effectiveness this cream is very good. It does a very good job at relieving dry, rough skin. I love the fact that it's fragrance free - I don't like putting anything on my body with too much scent in it and prefer products that are fragrance free. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the product is almost a little too thick and leaves my hands a little greasy and slippery."
132435,2,Every time I follow the instructions to a T. I've experimented with different times and amounts of moisture. Halfway through the pack now and I STILL haven't pulled out more than a few blackheads. What a BS product.
160935,0,"I open the box and i see how odly liitle it is then i was picturing. I undertand the hight is givin and that i didnt pay much attention. Yet it was verry dissapointing. ALso i do like how it has a grip spot on the iron part to place your fingers on, was verry convinant. I would have to say that its OK not the best but it will get you through."
167284,0,The prongs on the end of the cord did not fit into outlets of the hotels where I stayed in Italy; others have not found this to be true. I got an adapter and it worked fine. It was definitely better than the hotel hairdryers!
169941,0,"The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though."
61779,0,Personally this smells like a girl version of Old Spice. BUT if you purchase it from the actual website it smells slightly different and it lasts longer than say you purchase it from amazon.
9645,2,"Product did not work for me I saw no results AT ALL, ive been going for 1 week and 4days..5 times and this IS only a moisterizer, not am accelerator"
213273,2,I just thought it was a gimmick name.Animal placenta is used in the product. You have the placenta sloshing around on the bottom on the bottle. GROSS.I Just threw the product away
9290,2,"I liked the look of this set (horizontal styling) and that the clip was on top of each roller.They don't call it ""DUAL HEATING TECHNOLOGY"" for nothing. Each time I grabbed a hot roller it not only burns your hair, it burned my hands!I bought this setter because it appeared to have the type of clips I'm looking for. I found the clips hard to HOLD OPEN while my almost burned hand was trying to hold the roller in place for it.My current set up is my old clairol flocked set which uses metal clips. I have since purchased a bag of the plastic clasps that work great, but wanted ones that actually ""go"" with the setter. So far I haven't found good clasps with a new setter. Seems simple enough.Someone told me to try babybliss (sp)?I've been using hot rollers for 25 years without ever getting burnt if that helps."
174671,1,"I have the NARS duo eyeshadow in Brumes. The product is velvety smooth, easily blendable, and highly pigmented. NARS has a large variety of colors to choose from. While some of them are neutral, most of them are vivid and bold, so if you're not a fan of intense eye makeup, you should probably look elsewhere. However, you can have a lot of fun playing with these colors. The Brumes shades are a deep charcoal gray and a dark, shimmery grayish-blue. I love them, but they're super dramatic, so consider yourself warned."
227814,0,"I was so excited for this scent after smelling Pink Sugar . . Little did I know I would be let down :-(There was lemon, Earl Grey Tea (I dislike bergamot for the most part though it has added nicely in some scents), florals, and a hint of my grandmother in this scent . .I love my grandman, but blegh . . .I have yet to find a chocolate scented perfume I like which is sad for I LOVE chocolate (who doesn't?). I guess my search continues then, huh?"
37848,1,"I have been using Herbatint for about 8 years and I like it. I tried Revlon and Clairol, but my scalp itched for three weeks afterward. Herbatint is odorless and gives me a beautiful hair color. After I put the Herbatini conditioner on my hair is nice and soft. At age 34 my hair turned gray and luckily I saved clippings from a haircut I had at age 29 which matched the sepia crayon in the Crayola Crayon box. In my early 20's my hair color was chestnut (about 80% brown and 20% red). With Herbatini you must choose a hair color much lighter than your natural hair color - 7N Blonde gives me a light brown color which matches the sepia crayon. If I use 7C Ash Blonde it comes out a beautiful honey color which is nice for summer. I would like to try going back to the chestnut color since my eyes are blue and my cheeks are pink and it would look nice, but I don't know exactly which shade to try - copper or mahogany? The copper seems too orange and the mahogany too dark. If you have gray hair and can't remember your natural color it is best to go light rather than too dark. You'll be disappointed if it's too dark."
67350,0,This is masculine smelling perfume. Not too strong and the ladies love it. My wife bought this as a present for my nephew and he loved it. Appropriate for the evening and daytime. REally nice.
59777,1,"This soap is a blessing! I have extremely sensitive skin and every other ""soap"" (most drugstore ""soaps"" are really detergents not real soap) dries out my skin and irritates it and I'd given up on using anything with fragarence years ago. I had previously used the bar variety and decided to give the Castile Soap a run after another bad ""soap"" reaction to Johnson and Johnson's. Not only do I not react to this soap my skin is much softer and no longer dry, after only a week! It creates a very rich lather with just a little bit of soap. The tingly sensation (think very very mild Bengay feeling) from the pepermint oil is nice and refreshing to wake up to but I think I'll switch to the unscented Baby variety when it starts to get colder again. As far as it ""burning your eyes"" as one reviwer put it, it says right on the lable don't get it in your eyes (amoungst a variety of other good advise.) All real soap will burn your eyes, particularly something with peppermint oil in it."
181399,0,"I travel fairly frequently, so hotels are a routine affair. I saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently. Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back. I just received my replacement device, it took 15 days in total to receive it.I really hope this one lasts a bit longer.EDIT: I added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up."
29111,1,"This is my go-to amber oil, it smells great, the price fits my budget, and with the roll-on top, I don't have to stain my fingertips to apply it."
9373,1,"I love, love this product, have used it for years. I am very active, running, swimming etc. Needless to say I don't bother paying big bucks to get my hair professionally done. Now days I spray it on my hair work it through with my fingers and let it air dry and it dries straight and bouncy, when I flat iron my hair it looks straight out of the salon, I get compliments. I do use other products such as Nexus and Organix Shampoos and Conditioners but the key is this product. I am really bummed that SoftSheen stopped carrying it, their sister product: Dark and Lovely's Strenghener is not the same..don't waste your money. I'm so grateful that Amazon had a great seller with it. I'm stocked up for awhile now."
225435,0,"I got this to replace one just like it I had had for years that finally wore out. This one, however, I can't keep the brushes on long enough to even dry my bangs. Luckily I can use the dryer with an unattached styling brush to dry the rest of my hair. It was exactly what I wanted but doesn't work right."
28787,0,"I was a little disapointed when I tried this cream, I did not expect it to be so thick, I had used Laura Mercier Moisture before so I was expecting a similar or superior product,a few of my friends use philosophy and they are very happy with the results they get."
251779,1,This is a great bar soap - the olive oil base means that is doesn't make your skin dry out like some of the mainstream brands. I switched to natural soap because I was reading more and more articles about the chemicals that non-natural products have in them and how they can be bad for you. I highly recommend this soap and I've also tried some of the other stuff from Kiss My Face which I thought was very good as well.
156537,1,Love this color. Dries nice and lasts long. It is EXACTLY what I was looking for :) I love China Glaze!!
130409,0,"This is a little more toward orange than bronze. And it has those tiny 'sparkles' in it (I'm not crazy about 'glitter' in polish, even the very tiny ones). It's pretty enough - just not exactly what I was looking for. It's very hard to decide the true color of the polish based on a picture."
153796,0,i have only used it once so far but it left my hair feeling soft as ever
29418,0,"...I can't help but to be reminded of my grandmother. Maybe it's because she uses a different Givenchy perfume and they just have similar scents, but it definately has that &quot;old lady&quot; smell (in a good way!). If you're young and sexy enough to pull it off, go for it, but if you're getting on up there I would suggest something else."
36055,0,"This product is exactly what I expected, except for the fact that it only lasted through about 10 showers--ran out quickly. It is ""oily"", which is what I was looking for. I like the scrubbing factor, the scent, and the sheen that it put on my skin afterward. However, it does not last long at all. Will not be re-purchasing for that reason."
134936,2,I received my order in a fashionable time. Very unhappy with the quality of this item. There is no fragrance. I don't know how to go about getting my $45 back.
63096,2,"Cinnamon Buns Lip Shine is great for moisturinzing your lips and it lasts a long time (doesn't go away the first time you take a sip of a drink, etc)."
238753,1,I absolutely love this product. The shipping was fast and the product cam in one piece. Perfect shipping and my bf loved it for Christmas. Thank you very much. I would definitely buy from this seller again
202663,1,"...there is tinted moisturizer. Stila makes a very light one that comes in four different shades (light, medium, dark and warm)and contains SPF15 to protect you against early crow's feet. Give your face a boost without looking like Tammy Faye- a little of this stuff goes a long way. Once you try Stila's tinted moisturizer, you'll never use liquid foundation again. (Remember, though, that a tinted moisturizer won't conceal dark circles, acne or other skin blemishes.)"
80631,0,"First time I tried it. It's a good product, you only need a small amount to make it work, if you combine it with a little bit of water."
21435,1,This was a heck of a deal. The original formula is great. Not greasy. This size is perfect for traveling. Not too small. Lasts a lot longer than the smaller sizes available.
112720,1,"Marshmallow is a really common name drop around nail polish blogs, especially when it comes to combining it with glitter and making glitter sandwiches and the like. That's why I purchased it, and it didn't disappoint. Application is smooth, color is... delicious and marshmallow looking..? Keep in mind it is a jelly and takes several coats to become opaque, but I knew and expected and desired this going in. And Essie, as a more fancy brand than your average drug store polish, still holds a not-too-steep price point."
179542,0,"This product was not for me. Product was poor at creating a good lather and left my hair feeling squeaky clean instead of smooth and clean like I get with other men's shampoo. It is all natural and that is probably why it does not lather as well. Also the scent is Lemon which does not appear in the description of the product section. Though, it does not have much of a scent to it. Also it is safe for clor treated hair. Again, I'm sure this works for others but I will not purchase again."
95749,2,"Concisely put, the product has no hold, nor does it ever dry. It does have a high amount of shine, but that is about the only quality it offers. Given the high price of the product, one would expect it to perform well in some area, but it truly is nothing remarkable in any category I found after 2 weeks of use. Save your money on this one."
19008,0,I prefer to wear the rareminerals night time makeup during the day. the cost of 60$ for that prohibits me from getting in a constant habit of it since I wear makeup everyday of my life to even out scared skin. This has good coverage and oesn't cake on but I have extremely sensitive skin and have been allergic to any and all sunscreen since I was a child. I cannot tolerate wearing this for more than 4-6 hrs without getting the sunscreen irritating rash. I know people need sunscreen but please can someone make a decent makeup without it?! I give this a 3 though because most aren't allergic to the zinc or titanium dioxide or the chemicals in standard sunscreen like I am and you will be pleased with the coverage. if you are allergic to sunscreen zinc an titanium are the least irritating out of the bunch. Please bareescentuals start selling the rareminerals for a decent price or remove the sunscreen from this one
3269,0,"Being female with thinning hair, I'll try anything to hide it or make it better. After trying numerous products available, I didn't find anything particularly outstanding about this one. It's about as good as other store-bought brands of thickening gels. Actually, I found that my Paul Mitchell ""Thicken Up"" (found at my local Wal-Mart) is a bit lighter to the touch. The price point is about the same too.What this product DID do well, is allow me to go about an extra day without having to wash my hair. It didn't dry my hair out, but for some reason, my hair wasn't as oily as it tends to get in the summer time heat. That's a big bonus factor for me, although, I will probably just stick to what I can buy locally.* Price is fair.* Thickens about as well as other store-bought gels.* Doesn't ""gunk"" hair up (but I do recommend using a hair dryer to set)."
140574,1,"I was first introduced to this fragrance as a teenager, when my older and more sophisticated sister would wear it in the 80s. I remember sneaking in her room, spraying it on, and feeling so grown up and pretty! I have always loved the spicy scent and have never really found another fragrance that comes close to it, except with maybe Gucci by Gucci. Its a true classic that has never gone out of style. There must be something alot of people love about it, because it's been around for years! I still wear it when I want to feel sexy and pretty and bring back lots of memories of being a teen!"
46687,1,"There is no other hair vitamin on the market that works like this does. I bought this and in 10 days my hair transformed. Bottom line 17 days 1 1/2 inch growth 5 days softer hair, no breakouts and longer stronger nails. I am an African American woman with relaxed 3c hair that usually goes and does overall well, but this vitamin made my hair better than any other time in my life..yes it's true women it works. I was not sure so because of the costs I stopped taking them...well my hair still grew about 1/2 inch/month and returned to its shedding breaking state. I learned my lesson and have joined the 12 month membership. $40/month is a small price to pay for gorgeous hair, skin and nails!!"
219233,1,"I also use NOW coconut, rosehip seed, jojoba, grapeseed, & sweet almond oils (probably missing a few). This product meets my expectations. I have not tried it on food (I use coconut and olive oils for that) but it is great for skin and hair. I use it alternately with the aforementioned oils."
17300,1,i have curly hair that I perm and it gets very dry. this product is just WONDERFUL - it keeps my hair soft
127735,2,"I hate the Cre-C shampoo. I bought it, not expecting a miracle, but it didn't even come close to helping me a little bit. I guess my expectations were too high or maybe the hype on this product was just too much? Either way, this shampoo sucks. Not only was it a waste of money, but I literally hated the way the shampoo felt in my hair and how my hair felt afterwards. I was better off shampooing with actual poo. I want my money back."
193910,0,The green nail polish looked very bright and opaque on amazon. I thought it would be cute under OPI's black shatter. So I bought it and it turned out looking like marker on my nails. I had to layer like 4 or 5 coats and it still wasn't the true color. A bit disappointing and not very opaque. The color isn't a bright once you do 4 or 5 coats but it doesn't look as much like marker.
76823,2,"This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad. My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss."
233857,0,"I recently purchased this (Dec 10, 2009) for a Christmas present and I received it quickly. I didn't open the box until I was ready to wrap it, and found it with out the wooden case.I can't reveiw the product yet (Christmas Present), but the picture shown is without the case. Once we start using it I will add to the review.How deceptive is this?"
167923,0,"I have always had long hair, standard sized bobby pins don't work too well. I had a few of the larger ones left, from 15 or so years ago. My search for extra large bobby pins, rendered me these. They do the job, but I must state, they are not quite as thick or as long as the original older ones. I also don't think the tips are coated as well or as much as the original and older ones. Thank goodness something similar is still around though! The quality is NO REFLECTION on who sells them!!"
53804,0,"the 5x is not as good as i thought, will probably order another one but find a 10x. Still a good mirror just not what i wanted"
237157,0,I mainly got this as a replacement for another tea tree oil product I have used. You get way more in this bottle then in the other one I was ordering and I`m just as happy with it.
160791,2,"No original box!!!The liquid is not of the original color because I have a shop in Paris and is very different from this.Flee it is a counterfeit product.The liquid as The .17 mini bottle opens, but it does not close properly."
110352,1,"I really like the stuff, my only complaint is that it doesn't las as long as I'd like. other than that, it's very nice."
129060,1,"This is such a great product. I have been struggling with finding the right moisturizer for years, and this is the first one that has been able to keep constant hydration for my face!"
227255,0,"I have a sunburn on my arms, so when I saw a free sample of this at the health food store today, I used a generous amount. It felt nice, and at first it had a subtle almond scent, but by the time I left the store, I smelled overpoweringly of french toast. Exactly like french toast. I mean not just the maple syrup, but eggs and bread, too! It's amusing, but I'd rather not smell this way."
167142,2,"This product just goes on too white/green. It never fully blends in with your skin, and I'm a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians. Coverage will be just okay if I put it on a small area of my face, but since this has an SPF of 15, it's meant for your whole face.Maybe its the way I've been blending this into my skin, but I can never really make this blend in enough without having my face look a bit ""off."""
77328,2,"Shalimar is my favorite fragrance and I was delighted to find it here at such a good price. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition...but, the fragrance was ""off"". I think it was either old or had been stored improperly(hot/cold). Just not Shalimar and it smells funny. Can't use it."
19678,0,I bought this thinking the pen would be full when I got it...WRONG..it is LESS THAN HALF FULL..and you have to really work and beat and click ot get it out..then its goopy...and thick and is almost invisible...it isnt the pink I thought it would be and its just a gooey mess..I will not buy this again
14640,0,"Hi there,I got the item on 2/4 but I didn't open it cuz I bought this for my friend. Yesterday she told me that she got the one that is difference from the picture. The item is opened and is not in the states. Can I do exchange?"
96626,0,"I love argan oil but this is really, really hard to get out of the bottle. Very annoying!!"
135140,2,"I own the full size version of these rollers as well, and the travel size does not get even half as hot as the full size set, even if you let it heat up longer.However, there aren't any other travel size roller sets out there that provide jumbo size rollers, so if you don't mind just getting a wave, rather than curl, then this is your best bet."
209334,0,"*Grey color is nice*does soak up a good bit of water*as a result, dries very slowly*soft enough, but rougher than expected of ""chamois"""
178402,1,"this lasercomb most probably will not regrow much hair, i have used it for about 14 months. i have seen my hair become thicker and looks like they stopped falling, i have even seen some thin hair regrow, after about 6 months very few new thin hair started to thicken and that was it. after 12-14 months people who had not seen me for a year -- said that my hair is thicker. so others also notice these results. if spending 500$ is not much for these kind of use, then this lasercomb may be helpful, it will be more helpful for those who are just starting to loose hair."
54047,2,"I only used this product once, because that is all the product would allow me. The only time I used it, I heated it up, and placed the rollers in my hair. It didnt feel much hotter than normal hot rollers, but when I took them out of my hair I found that the plastic had melted, and the rollers were deformed. Luckily my hair was not fried completely, but it did take about a week of conditioning treatments daily to repair the damage.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
110329,0,"I really like the smell of sandalwood so I bought this perfume oil. The smells takes a while to settle, meaning, the smell softens the longer you have it on. I discovered this after putting some on my wrist, and didn't like the initial pungent odor. I kept smelling it for about a half an hour, and was pleasantly surprised how the smell had changed."
182262,0,"It is def neon as stated. But the picture shows the color to be pink. It is actually a peachy orange color. Its still real pretty, although I am a pink girl."
149102,1,"I bought this straightener at a Salon about 7 or 8 years ago, and I still love it!!!! It is still holding up great and is the best straightener I have ever used!!!"
115552,1,"I haven't had this product in the summer yet, but all through my workouts and 16 hour days I never turn into a racoon. I never reapply it throughout the day unless I'm going out and want a darker look. Only flaw is that it doesn't sharpen well, so use a metal eyeliner sharpener rather than a regular pencil sharpener and there won't be a problem."
110715,2,"The product was obviously out of date. It should have been of a cream consistency, however when lid was removed it ran out of the tube and had small particles in it. I had to throw it away!"
192915,0,"This is OK Shampoo, I didn't find it to be any better than any other. The smell is OK too, though not my favorite."
211216,2,"There is no doubting that this cologne has an amazing smell, I put it on and it smells fantastic. It seems like the scent develops, grows into an even better smell after a little bit of putting it on. Which is why I'm so disappointed that the smell lasts almost no time at all. I put it on, feel and smell great, and 10 minutes later I smell my wrists/ chest and there is no longer any type of scent.I spray one or 2 squirts onto my chest and rub it in, mixes well with shirts and from my experience girls absolutely love it. My other colognes can leave a scent in the shirt for quite a while, the better ones sitting in for a week or so. This spray doesn't even hold in the cloth.I don't know if it's the bottle or not, because there are several reviews that say it lasts and smells great forever. I've tried multiple times and I just cannot get it to stay for more than 10 minutes. It's really frustrating because this is honestly one of the best scents I've owned in a while."
191895,1,My doctor recommended this product because of my dry skin. This has helped me very much - its a very mild cleanser which does not dry or irritate your skin. I would recommend this to anyone that has acne and/or dry skin problems.
127686,2,"It broke 5 seconds after plugging it into the 12v socket in my car. I tried it out in another car, and it was still broken. I wish somebody would design a quality version of this product, because it is a great idea."
138670,2,Power cord started to shore out a year and a half into use. I only use this at home and am not a stylist so it wasn't heavy use. I called the company and the product is only warranted for a year. The replacement cost was $21 but buy the time you pay for shipping both ways what's the point? My revlon brand iron lasted many years longer. Needless to say I'm disappointed since it's suppose to be a professional item that it died after light home use.
143891,0,"The powder is nice, but I see little difference between the performance of these papers and less expensive brands. Plus, the case is not as functional as I'd like. It's s very soft and very supple plastic, which gives little protection to the sheets and is easily caught and bent back during removal and replacement in your purse. They're not actually good at containing the sheets either. I had to keep my pack in one of the pockets of my purse. Not a huge inconvenience, but it just didn't make any sense not to provide a more functional case."
218279,1,Absolutely pleased with my purchase. It arrived really fast!!!! Thank you so much for putting this item on the market!
175755,2,I didn't like the smell. Also it irritated the area under my eyes and I returned it. Good that it is paraben free.
207562,0,"Need to do better on shipping. Putting 20 bottles of polish in a envelope with nothing to protect bottles doesn't work very well. When I received this order, there were 3 broken bottles of polish. Polish was everywhere."
47442,1,"All those expensive ""eye and face creams"" you keep purchasing - they don't do much good! Get back to basics - Vitamin C cream is AMAZING! My husband is a fly fisherman and has used Vitamin C cream for years! I am now using it and people are always complimenting me on my skin! This is an amazing ointment!"
248527,1,"I was first introduced to Steiner products on a cruise. Love the results hair looks and feels very healthy.Didn't know where to find product after checking with a few salons so used advice received from salon personnel on board cruise ship and checked on line and sure enoughn amazon carries what I want. Same price as I paid on board the ship and I pay no tax, and free shipping and I also received a bonus gift worth over $100 of sun screen products.AWESOME DEAL and PRODUCT"
94314,0,"I like this sponge overall, and I use it instead of a washcloth, but I wish it were softer. Even when wet and soaped up it feels like sandpaper on the skin. I would say that if one has sensitive skin, to keep shopping.I've been using it for six months now and it hasn't softened up any with use, but it also hasn't shown any signs of wear or tear."
207025,2,Bumble and Bumble's site sells thickening shampoo 8 oz for 24.00. I love the stuff but on not paying the price here! Why would anyone spend 39.00 for 8 oz when you can buy it for $24.00? Also the other bad reviews...about the products not being genuine and/or watered down. ???? Something not trustworthy here.
18388,0,To me this was too thick & sticky. I prefer a creamier gloss. The taste is also not great. Just not for me.
60962,2,"I see this review is listed under Medium Auburn Brown, even though I specified Linen, but since they changed the formula across the board I'll go ahead and write a general review. I have used Natural Instincts Linen for many years and have always loved it because it looked so natural. Not any more! The new formula is terrible! It doesn't cover as well as the old formula and looks fake. And the special solution you put on after a couple of weeks makes it even worse!! For the first time ever, friends asked me what I did to my hair! I hate trying other brands because I've been so pleased before, but it looks like I'm going to be looking for a new company. Please, Clairol, bring back the old formula! It can be the ""New, Improved"" solution!!"
132663,0,"I didnt find this product to work very well for me. If you wash your face regularly with something that can scrub and not just hands, this won't do much for you. It wont pick up the smaller black heads either. All I can say is wash your face regularly if your worried about black heads and you can save your $15 on this."
195796,0,I have yet to try the 'Serum'. When I got my order I got capsules rather than serum. When I notified Olympian they politely agreed to send the order I requested and provide me with a way to return what I haven't opened. Can't wait to try it.
207501,0,"I had high hopes for this perfume. I ordered a sml bottle based on reviews but was very dissapointed once I tried it.It litteraly smells like a bouquett of flowers, and to my nose, a strong smell of roses.The scent is nothing special. It does not last long on my skin. A couple hours at most and for the price it should last all day long.My bf said it was ""okay"". He preferes my other perfums and really likes my body lotions and sprays . Good, it's cheaper!Dont waste your money on this perfume. It's nothing special."
21114,0,"My sister and I both love doing our nails so when her birthday rolled around I decided to add a Zoya nail polish to her present list. I decided to go with Stephanie (it's her name) and hoped she liked it. I was concerned about it being so light/sheer/etc. but she tried it the next day and said she loved it. It applied easily, dried quickly, and didn't need more than 3 coats to reach bottle color. Definitely well done Zoya."
139074,1,I liked this curling iron so much that I am in the process of replacing all of my different sized irons with this brand.
10354,2,"It's a spendy product for one usage - mine clogged after using it ONCE. I've rinsed the tip, the cap's spout and underside after popping it off, hot water, cold water, warm... doesn't unclog. WHAT A WASTE!!!"
87290,2,"This shampoo did nothing for my severe dandruff that plain old head and shoulders couldn't do. I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. Then again, Nizoral has been the only shampoo to work for me, but since it is SO hard to come by I have to keep my options open."
50013,0,"I have some sagging starting to show around the jowls, and some wrinkling/crows feet, to be fair I just started using this cream three weeks ago, SO FAR...This cream is just ok... Its claims are mostly hype, however, when using it at night before bed, my skin feels nice in the morning, but as far as repairing wrinkles and sags.. sorry guys its not the answer, and Ive tried em all.... the one thing that has helped the most is facial strength training.. its time consuming, and most of us want a quick fix, me being one.... while I had some down time, I decided to be faithful with the facial strength training, and those results were pretty good, but you must keep at it, and I dont have the time.. also... DMAE is a good supplement for the skin with sags, but taking it internaly is better, and you can go to health stores, buy your own DMAE make your own cream very inexpensive, and add much more DMAE to your cream with much better results"
147089,2,"I was very surprised the first time I used it. It smells exactly like my hair color (peroxide). This can not be good. It feels stiff shortly after applying. And sticky. But mostly, it smells really bad!!"
20606,1,"I purchased this item last month and I've been happy with it since. I originally purchased this because I didn't want my tattoo to be visible during a job interview.~The kit includes:-loose Finishing Powder light brown-Primer WHITE (consistency of pressed liquid foundation)-2 liquid Concealers in Rich Beige & Light Brown (1/2 oz.)-Camellia extract Hydrating Base (consistency of lotion)-sponge-small make-up brush-comes in a small tin case (like an old-school lunch box)The results? I did what the instructions said (use the hydrating base, let dry, then applied primer to area w/sponge, let dry, then applied concealer in my desired shade, let dry, and then finally applied the finishing powder). Very easy to do, just make sure you have time to do it. After applying the primer and the concealers, I immediately saw results. After using the finishing powder, that's when it looked a lot like real skin. You couldn't tell that there was a tattoo there, unless you put your face close to it and stare really hard! The cover-up will last you ALL DAY LONG...it is also WATER-PROOF and SMUDGE-PROOF.Negatives? Just make sure that the foundation really matches your skin tone. If this one doesn't, find another one that matches yours and you're bound to make use of this tattoo kit successfully."
67829,1,"Finally a product that actually does what the name implies.I just can't say enough about how great this line is. Found it when I was buying cortisone cream to put on my face after using a high end product. I have very dry sensitive skin and have bought products costing $100.00 on down with varied results. THIS LINE IS A GEM! As long as it works I'll buy it. The foundation goes on smooth and really does stay on all day without feeling dry. I use all of the skin and beauty line and will continue to do so.Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
60225,0,I just had my toe digits done and was a little disappointed. The Pink look in the bottle is not what landed on my toes. More of a beigy look. Can anyone suggest a another color for me. I tried Vanity too and the same thing.
227668,0,"I've owned this dry over a year. I have fairly short, fine hair. I do not think it is quiet, and as others have stated it does seem to really blow my hair all over the place. I do use the concentrator nozzle to direct the heat somewhat, but it still is challenging to direct the flow where I want it. The cool button is a pain to have to hold down in order to get cool flow. As for the ""ion"" effect, I honestly don't know if I see it with this dryer. Thankfully, I have not had any issues with sparks, burning, etc.; yet I would not repurchase--there are better dryers out there."
225129,2,"I don't normally write reviews, but this product is so bad, I felt obligated. Admittedly when I first got these rollers about a month ago they worked great. But now, only one month later, they don't heat up at all!! Absolutely cold no matter how long I leave them turned on to heat! Buyer beware!"
19149,0,"I think I got the wrong color. lol. It's just a little lighter than I expected so I didn't rate based on that. For me, a person with oily combination skin, this foundation made me look a little too shiny after a few hours of wearing it. I guess I should have tried the matte foundation instead"
158685,0,"Some have mentioned a smell to this soap. I either got used to it or it wasn't so bad. Hubby didn't complain anyway. It's somewhat of a pleasant scent. I have to say, the bar did not last long. I figure for what I paid for it I would have liked for it to have lasted longer. Also I really didn't notice a difference in my skin. I don't think it was worth the purchase."
125343,0,"This product is alright. But to me, it smells very simple, mostly just cloves is all I smell. I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh. It has very little lasting power on my skin. I would say it lasts about an hour and then it can no longer be smelled on me. It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice. Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves."
50935,1,Love it; it's easy.I even put good smelling oil or something in the water sometimes. But be careful not to burn yourself.
250356,0,"My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift, Paid 4 maybe 5 dollar extra for the next day delivery. It was never here. Extremely disappointed, The item itself is beautiful Just like I always wanted. Just wish It was here when we paid for it to be"
116408,1,This stays on all day and blends well. Works great for oily skin (as does other Colorstay makeup). Give it a minute to dry and it looks great.
133391,2,This shampoo is ok... Nothing special... Didn't really add any moisture in my hair like it was supposed to. I will go back to Nexxus Shampoo for sleek and smooth hair. It moisturizes a lot better than this product... Probably will not purchase again.
143799,1,This is a great product. Covers well and blends in very good. I found out about this product from my sister-in-law who had some and I tried it and liked how well it blended and covered. It covered my old age spots LOL very well and I would make a purchase of this product again when this one that I bought runs out. I give the seller a great rating for getting to me on time and for the price that it is being sold for. Great Great product.
72710,1,I AM NOT TOO crazy about the smell of this product but over all it is very pleasant
169056,0,I was not too happy with this item. It was too thick and hard to apply. I would not use it agaqin. Sorry.
183865,0,"I own this hair dryer now for around 6 weeks. I have long thick straight hair, so need a hair dryer that will dry quickly (before I get bored).This hair dryer does a good job of drying my hair quickly. However, I find it quite heavy, and the button for the cold air is just where it is most comfortable for me to hold it, and so I often end up pressing this accidentaly. Also, the sliders to turn on and off/change heat settings are almost flush with the hairdryer, so if you have wet or slippy hands, it is not easy to move the sliders. I also find the power cord far too long for what I need (my outlet is right beside my mirror), and so it tends to just get tangled up in itself.I like this hair dryer because it does a good job of drying my hair. But I wouldn't buy it again, I'm sure there are other hair dryers that do just as good a job that aren't as inconvenient to hold/use."
3915,2,"I had really high hopes for this Platinum color spray. It's sprays out SO hard and fast that it was basically like a huge glob of this glittery stuff on the top of my head. It looked awful, smelled awful, and is basically just light glitter. Also, after I sprayed it one time, that was it... there was nothing left in the can!! A total rip off.YUCK. I learned my lesson, and I'm never buying this again. The good thing is that it washed out right away."
136746,2,"I recently transitioned from permed to &#34;natural hair. And being a woman of color I wanted to find products to maximize my natural hair growth. Seeing the online reviews for FAST, I decided to give it a try. I hate that I wasted my money. The product did ship on time, however, You must wash your hair with this product every day :( Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle. The conditioner made it a little softer, but it basically matted my hair and made it very tangled and difficult to manage. I had high hopes but was let down.... the only positive thing is that it has a pretty nice smell...lol I didnt even get through half the bottle!!!!"
53426,0,"when i order it i was told it wont smell or make you feel sticky. well for me it did both. It may be a good product, Just not for me. I bought the kit so i would do it correctly and limit the chance of turning blotchy and orange. I did what the directions said to do to the T.On the plus side the exfoliate smells really good. It feels great as well. For me the fake bake original didn't work for me. The flawless fake bake was much better and it smelled much better as well."
51099,1,"This a very intriguing, romantic, sensual scent. The balance of essential oils is prefect! If you like sandalwood and more musky scents, you'll love this."
218748,0,In the title it says female but the bottle and description say male. Typo? This description and title needs updated its confusing.
88811,0,"the product is good and I love the products of this brand, but the price they charge for the office is very high, 50% of the value of the product, therefore, not recommended."
167948,1,"I have long, fine, natural blonde hair with a stubborn wave that poofs out in humidity. I use this to tame frizz and poofiness and it works. It isn't perfect, but it is better than spending 500 dollars. 2 Step application couldn't be easier, but the smell is horrendous. However, this did not work for my daughter who had color treated her hair. I had even bought the color safe formula, but she did not have good results."
129177,0,"Used as instructed - 3 times a week. However, after couple of full face treatments, developed a sore rash around eyes, redness and inflamation. Eyes becames sore and dry -stopped using. I didn't contacted l'Oreal. Few days later worse, face hot and burning, rash progressed down face. Eyes became painful.Some how i'm gud. It might not fit for some skins. Just beaware when you buying some of these kind of products which may or may not fit for all"
231861,0,"I want to start off by saying I'm a competitive dancer, and I've been fake tanning for about 10 years now, for competition. I'm no novice when it comes to tan application. I like some other products more, but they're just too expensive.Pros:Colour (turns out great! A nice bronzy golden glow)CostCons:Poorly designed nozzleSmell (I'm not talking the DHA-sweet tanner smell. THAT I can live with. the fragrance they've used to cover up the DHA smell makes this product smell like bug dope)all in all if you can get the application right, this is a great product. I actually REALLY like the formula. It IS a little bit greasy feeling, but you can rub it in and it dries pretty fast (ten minutes, give or take). The spray...it sprays and smells like bug dope. It's nearly impossible for you to get an even tan with the way it sprays. My best results were to spray it on, then rub rub rub! Some spray tans you can't get away with that. This one, it seems to be the only way to get even colouring. I wish this were an aerosol, that'd make things a lot easier. Also pressing the button down was pretty hard. I thought I had a defective can at first. It'd be nice if there were a safety seal, too...but oh well.Colour is great. Build gradually! A little goes a long way with self tanning."
57432,0,"This stuff smells good (like perfume) and feels pretty good on my skin, but it's a little sticky (the consistency is kind of like soft chapstick). I don't use it as much as I use other products because there are little bits of grittiness in the tub I got, which I've seen others complain about. I also do experience some light itchiness after I put it on and then put on my clothing."
98883,1,"Great scent that isn't too sweet but not too woodsy either! Some are turned off by the fact that it's made by the famous womens bridal designer, but in reality, she knows how to make a man smell amazing! I love this scent and have been wearing it for three years. First time to buy it from amazon and the process was a breeze with fast shipping."
19850,2,"My daughters and I have used Biosilk Silk Therapy for a quite a few years. This silk therapy has its own distinct smell and consistency. I thought to save a few dollars and purchase online...unfortunately, I think there's something fishy going on. The products I received did not have that distinct silk therapy smell and even more...when it's poured out into your palm, there's a watery consistency at first followed by the serum...if you can picture oil and water not mixing!! Will not be purchasing these again unless it's from a reputable store."
216099,1,"I have sensitive skin and it break out easily. This product is truly soothing and painless. I also have neve had such clear skin as I have using their line. I highly recommend this and their line, esp. ifyou have tried several products and have never been satisfied."
79843,0,"I bought this in my grocery store because it was at a drasticallly reduced price, so I decided to give it a try. As a moisturizer, it's not bad at all. The only major drawback is the smell. It smells almost like Raid. Other than that, it does moisturize well. It takes a few minutes for the smell to go away."
28844,2,"I was also very excited to try this primer. I like philosophy products but this is just horrible for my skin. I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin. Have been using it for 6 days and I have broken out after not having not even one pimple for months. Specially in the cheeks and chin area. I applied it, the consistancy was good liked that, let it dry over the 2 minutes and then applied my foundation. Really like how my foundation looked with this and it did not make me oily. But the BIG problem once again it made me brake out, so ladies dont waist your time if you have similar skin. I will continue on my quest for the best primer!!!"

37715,0,"I lover this liner because it applies smoothly, you can wing it out with precision for a killer cat eye, or just keep it simple. Either way, you get a crisp, dark, defined line that will last all day. I have had my Smudge Pot (I call my Smudgie. haha) for several months now and it is still creamy as it was on day 1. Also, you get a good amount, totally worth the price.HOWEVER, I am a contact wearer, and have found that this liner, in particular, finds its way to my eyes and clouds up my contacts with a waxy film. I have tried applying liner before putting in my contacts, but the liner still waxed up my vision. I even tried to ""blot"" the brush on my hand 1st, so I apply a very thin coat, but that didn't work either. I did not have this problem with the L'oreal H.I.P. gel liner, but I have have since replaced all of my makeup with products that are not tested on animals; the L'Oreal had to go. It was a very good liner, though, no problems w/ contact lenses. I am going to have to try another brand.. MAC Fluidline, or Bobbi Brown....If you do not wear contacts, then I would definitely recommend this liner, but beware if you do wear contacts. Be prepared to clean (scrub, almost!) your lenses a few times to clean them up. It can get really annoying. =[ The liner still looks great, though. Wah-wah. =[Oh Smudgie, why can't we get along... I love you. ='["

BUT L'Oreal Hair Color has been my choice to take a bit of the summer red out of medium brown long hair, SINCE I WAS 14 and my ""Grand Mere"" told me that only slatterns and women of the evening had MY color before I colored it. Also, coloring in the darker shades, uses only 20 volume creme activator, which make thin hair coated with color, shine, and gives it volume. COLOR YOUR HAIR A DARKER SHADE FOR SHINE!"
84830,2,"Usually I use Loreal Excellence Creme (light brown #6), but this product did not cover the roots which are 50% gray and very dark brown. I did like the highlighting process which was fairly easy, but the color portion just did not do as good of a job."

My eyebrows have even filled back in finally (I'm 44 yrs old)I have not had excess or new growth to other parts of my body only my hair and eyebrows and they haven't broke my face out. (even at my age I still have problems with that, lol) I don't bleach my hair but I do have it colored, I don't use a blowdryer or a iron on it and my hair stylist never wants to trim it because he says I never have any split ends ~ so they must be doing something good because nObody has ever said that to me before!"
83583,0,"This hair dryer is very strong and has good setting options. It does fit the head even in full jumbo rollers, which isn't easy to find. But if you want to move, you have to figure out how to get the stand to go back up to the position it was in when you sat down, while your arms are behind you and you can't see. Not an easy task. It should stay put, or at least have a latch for this intent. Bad set-up design. But the motorworks are good, and so are the options for settings. The price was reasonable and it would be an excellent purchase if it would stay put."
228729,1,I love the smell of baby powder and the Loves products all smell like baby powder so I have to have it.
102301,0,It's probably not a bad product. Im giving it a neutral rating because its kind of a pain to put on and comes off quicker than the cluster eyelashes. Its C shaped so sometimes when the glue is drying the lash kinda tips and sets crooked.

180718,0,Okay. I have had many hair driers throughout the years. This one is just ok. It does not have enough power to quickly dry my extremely curly hair. I would have preferred one with more power.

31779,0,"I thought this was a good mascara, but not for this time of the year. It didn't really hold up during the allergy season. I think that a waterproof version may have suited me better. Another thing that I wished that it would've had besides waterproofing was a curved brush. On the plus side, I liked the color, it didn't clump, and it didn't smell bad. I'd recommend this product to someone who doesn't have allergies but wanted a nice shade of mascara that didn't clump up."
200434,1,"My wife purchased this for me for Christmas and I absolutely love the smell of it. The only reason I took 1 star away is because of the sprayer, it's a bit awkward to use."

2288,0,"I was told by commercial rep for national chain that Bvlgari provides three levels of this product line: Cologne [% higher of perfume content], Eau de toilette [ % perfume lesser than Cologne] but lasts thru 8hr exposure to air..and finally After-Shave class [highest level of alcohol w/ approx 2hr duration after exposed to open air]. The delivered bottle came in factory wrap with unopened cellophane pkg. This bottle in review, although accurate to Bvlgari specs, did not have mfg sticker with serialized ID on bottom of bottle or pkg. One can not tell which of the THREE product categories this delivery contained. Fragrance and strength closely matched AfterShave..but remains unknown. Buyer be-aware.

175429,0,"As the definition of 3 stars indicates, ""it's OK"". It works as expected and includes an average number of attachments for hair dryers in this price range. It has sufficient blowing power and operates comparable to any other hair dryer I have owned over the past 35+ years. The ""Ionic Ceramic Styling System"" is a BS gimmick in my opinion. It doesn't provide any noticeable difference in performance or in the way my hair feels or acts afterwards. As someone else has mentioned, the color I received is black/white, not black/silver. This had nothing to do with my rating... just an observation that has yet to be corrected in the description of the item.Also, on a side note, the prices on Amazon sometimes fluctuate too much. I bought this item less than two weeks before writing this review. I paid under twenty, and now it's twenty-five. IMO, that's quite a jump for such a short timeframe, and I would have selected another model given today's price."

75073,1,"I love these soaps...The last forever and smell fantastic. Wish I could purchase them locally. Also make great birthday gifts, etc."
163294,1,"This is a good very quality brush - bristles are sturdy and much longer than the other type of natural bristle brushes and they really hold up to repeated use. I don't think that it's meant to be used wet, though - just for dry brushing. It will last a lot longer that way. Some reviewers have said that the brush is too rough. It does seem a bit stiff at first, but it softens slightly with use and you quickly get used to it. I love it just the way it is and I don't think it would be effective if it was too mushy. The only downfall I see is that it doesn't have a hand strap on the brush head and that's a big inconvenience. I made one from a wide piece of elastic and attached it to the sides of the brush with small nails. That works great and I'm very happy with my brush! It's well worth the money and I will be purchasing another to have as a spare."

224383,2,I really dont understand how this straightener got so many high reviews at all. I have shoulder length hair thats frizzy if left to air dry...but I can usually straighten my hair just fine with other straighters in about 20 minutes. This straightener takes over 30 min and it does Not work well on dry hair. It doesn't leave hair smooth and my hair would be really poofy if i didnt go over it like 4 times. It literally made me sweat when I used it because of all the times i had to go over my hair! That and all the steam. I used it on the high setting too and although it would get my hair mostly dry ...it would just be dry and frizzy. The very back would still stay damp. Its fine for the money and if your hair is naturally straight but I returned this straightener for the remington t studio tourmaline flat iron which works well.
44907,0,This is a BEAUTIFUL smelling product but the scent doesn't last very long. I think for the price the scent should stay with you more than an hour. I love the fragrance but it doesn't last.

171001,0,"I love the color of this polish. It's bright and unique and complimentary to most skin tones [I would imagine]. However, the texture of it sucks. It has glitter, and it makes it really hard to apply smoothly and evenly. It's pretty thick. Getting it off is impossible, you have to use 100% acetone. With that being said, it doesn't really chip easily and stays on well."
81763,2,"Too strong, too sweet, smells cheap. Avoid this at all costs"
222068,0,The Hot Air Brush works really well. It makes drying and styling my hair so much easier than the old separate blower and brush. My only problems are that it gets too hot to handle at times and it doesn't have dual voltage for foreign travel.
25035,2,It didn't smell pretty on me. I tried to give the bottle away. No one liked it.
106414,1,"PURE POISON is a seductive and sensual blend of mandarin, citron, bergamot (fun fact: bergamot is commonly used in Earl Grey Tea), orange flower, lily, jasmine, and gardenia with hints of sandalwood and amber (which ironically last the longest scent-wise).Here's some tips about PURE POISON:1) Three simple words: SMELL BEFORE BUY . . . . It's always good to test out the perfume before you purchase it . . . I'd like to think we all have different fragrance tastes or we'd all be smelling the same . .haha . .2) The scent strength is moderate . .Not too subtle and not too overpowering . .jussttt right . .3) I'd say the scent life is around 8 hours (like most decent perfumes) . .which makes it perfect for a day at work or school or whatever . .4) I'd recommend this for casual use . . . I'd save something more unique and provocative for your ""special"" scent . . .5) This is a bit of a sophisticated scent so I wouldn't recommend it for teens . . especially those who are fresh to the perfume sceneNOTE: I don't know if this fragrance contains citronellol which is the main cause of allergic reactions for those who have perfume allergies . .so I'd check up on this is that concerns you. . ."

143336,2,"I read many of the reviews on this product before purchasing it and I was very surprised to see how runny it was when I got it because nobody mentioned that in the reviews. I have used many self tanning lotions and this one is very different. Unlike a lotion, it is very runny, like an oil almost. When it gets on your hands while applying, it instantly discolors your skin and you must immediately scrub it off so you won't be left with stained hands. Most tanners when washed right after application do not leave stains on your fingers and hands unless you don't wash them off. It is very hard to apply this product as it is literally like water, which is also the first ingredient listed on the product. I don't think I could get used to using this product, it is just not your typical self tanner at all."
251115,0,"I bought this someplace else, where they didn't have the unscented version (same maker, blue label instead of purple), and it was very expensive even on sale.Because it said it had no added artificial or chemical fragrance added, I thought I would try it (being on sale was also a factor, but now that I've found it on Amazon, I realize I paid way too much even on sale... the Amazon price is 1/3 less than I paid on sale).However, if you have any sensitivity to floral scents, you should skip this one and try their unscented version of this same cream. I am glad that Amazon is listing this product as scented, because the scent really is fairly strong. It is an attractive scent, but never the less, wearing this product, even as a hand cream, makes my eyes red and my nose stuffy.It has some really good ingredients, so I am going to try buying the unscented version and find a friend to give the rest of this cream to, since it is too expensive to just throw it out.I am giving it three stars because a) I could not stand to use it long enough to see how well it worked, and b) the info on its box implied much less scent and smell than it has--even as a scented product, an anti-aging face cream for every day wear does not need to have this much smell to it."

237771,1,"My daughter has asthma and allergies, and her skin is very sensitive. Using other soaps - even mild baby soaps - she would have problems with eczema and really dry skin on her legs, back, sides and tummy. We started using this soap about 2 years ago, and she hasn't had problems since. Even though it's expensive, it works out to be a good deal when we factor in that we don't have to slather her down with expensive lotions and creams any more.It's OK on hair, but we use it just occasionally to get out the gunk that shampoos leave behind.This isn't a really sudsy soap, and it's easy to use too much. What we do is mix half of this with half water in a foaming soap dispenser (ours is an old Dawn foaming pump). That helps make a nice lather that can be spread around, rather than just having the liquid soap run down into the tub.Even though this is mild, it's definitely not tear-free, so be careful not to get it in the eyes with younger kids."
176488,2,"i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it. Well, i really don't care for it. And now i can't find the return sticky label to return it and i'm really bummed about that because it cost $55!!maybe if you could help me with that, that would be great!thanks Becky"

I've discontinued straightening alltogether to grow parts of my hair out, and will then never purchase another CHI hair straightener again."

I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin. I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin (and as a result, into my bloodstream) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial & error on different skin care products. TIRED of wasting money! I want something affordable AND safe! Is this too much to ask???I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine. After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product!!! Here [...] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient:I would rather not risk it & if you read the facts on it you probably won't either!If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural & non-comedogenic (I mean ALL the ingredients are)(NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne (DRYING) agents in them,I am open!PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE, all natural, non-comedogenic, NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer (as cold cream does)!Thanks!"
41652,0,"This dryer certainly dries fast, and straightens, but my hair comes out frizzy. I have very fine curly hair. I can see how it might work better on thicker and fuller hair than mine.

93911,2,This product did not work at all. I have used other products that were cheaper that gave my hair some body and actually minimized the thinning hair. This gave me no body and did not work adequately.
126646,0,"First off, I'd like to say that I love the scent of the olive oil and coriander. It seems like an odd combination but it's wonderful. The cleanser smells very clean and the lotion absorbs without greasiness.Now the reason for the 3 stars. It's just too much for the kitchen. When you start cooking you need to have clean, scent free hands. You don't want to wash your hands and then start kneading bread or making a meatloaf or chopping up vegetables with hands that are so highly scented the smell transfers to the food. Your food will now smell like olive oil and coriander. I want my hands to have no fragrance on them whatsoever when I'm cooking.And it's the same when you're eating. You don't want to put such a highly scented aroma on your hands and then have your hands going to your mouth when eating dinner. It's just too much odor and it actually overwhelms the food.Now for a bathroom dispenser it would be good. It has a very pleasing aroma when it's on its own. But combined with cooking and the kitchen it's not acceptable. In fact, Cucina, means kitchen in Italian and this combo is often advertised for kitchen use.It's a great on it's own but not for use around food."
138318,0,"I bought this and the shampoo hoping it would prevent my hair loss from chemo. However, one of my chemo agents is Taxol and my hair has begun to fall out 15-17 days after the first chemo session. But if you find that you are not on Taxol I would think this product would work. It did make my hair and scalp feel better than it had in a long time so was very hopeful it would work. Since it is coming out very slowly perhaps thymuskin slowed the inevitable process?"

It's not any better than my 25 year old Clairol setter, except for the cord rewind feature, which I love.My Clairol has wire clips which I don't like. I like the large plastic clips. This one doesn't come with either, it comes with these hard to open long spring clamps that are hard to use.It's a shame because it was a nice looking setter with a cord rewinder, but too expensive anyway."

166794,2,Okay so I was so excited to try this because of all the rave about it online it does give u a nice glow but it was giving me hives when i used it it didnt give me a tan tho only a glow. and the bottle if your doing a full body deffinitaly is not enough for no more than 4-6 uses. and thats probley how many times you would need to use it to even get dark not worth the money.
89151,0,"I received the hairdryer in July as a gift and by the following February it was dead. It worked great while it lasted but as I was the ONLY person using it, I feel it should have lasted a lot longer. I have had $20 hairdryers that have lasted for 5 plus years. However, I will say that Amazon stepped up and went above and beyond service and replaced the dryer immediately. Very happy with Amazon and hoping the new dryer lasts longer than 6 months."
169884,2,"Okay... I read all the reviews before purchasing this item ~1.5 months ago. I tried using it on many occasions. It is easy to use. It did not leave bruises on my skin. But it also didn't suck much oil out of my pores either. And you want to know why? Because I'm already using micro-abrasive facial cleansers as well as exfoliation-enhancing salicyclic acid treatments. So maybe this product works for those who do not already spend a lot of time and effort deep-cleaning their face. But for people already following a rigorous cleansing protocol, this product does not do a thing."
166174,0,"For your buck this is definately a great spa product. It's a refreshing cool mask that does leave your skin feeling rejuvinated and soft. If you really love the whole ""spa"" experience then you'll be happy with what this product offers.However, do not really expect this to do anything for your skin if you have acne. It doesn't have any active ingredients in it that would really take care of that problem. This won't rid you of your pimples, blackheads or in any way shrink your pores. (Although it will claim to do just that)I gave it three stars mainly because I get annoyed with any product that promises something it can't possibly deliver (and doesn't even come close to doing). So have fun but don't expect a miracle."

I actually bought several so I would never be without, because after many many years of use, the bristles do fall out. This is the best brush as it is easy to hold and easy to brush through both wet and dry hair. I would definitely recommend it."

155506,2,"This book is a psychology textbook with some bible verses plugged into it. Pyschology sometimes parallels the Bible, but many times takes a very humanistic turn. These Christian authors did not or would not discern the difference. The basic ideas of knowing your limits are good, especially if you have grown up not understanding the blessing and gift of boundaries in your life. They consistently suggest drawing lines in your life and expecting people to respect them, but they never come out and say that God has to define where your need to draw the lines and then more times than not you have to let Him defend them. By not clarifying this, the reader is left with a void that is filled with whatever they feel like the boundary should be. There are times when God will ask you to do something that you don't think you have the strength, time and/or money to do, but you do it because your Savior is asking you to and He will provide the resources. It would have been so much more helpful to today's church if instead of writing 300 pages of psychology definitions with some scripture, they would have written 25 pages on basic, biblical priorities (i.e. knowing what has eternal value), hearing the voice of God, and understanding fear of man verses fear of God (i.e. caring what God says about the situation verses what people are thinking or saying about you).One last thought, they suggest a support group or therapist to help with a ""boundaryless"" life; I have found that having Jesus Christ do his simple work of convicting,forgiving,healing and then strengthening is far more effective then even years of professional counseling."
214349,2,"I purchased this product because it had gone on sale and was now significantly cheaper than my normal go-to brand, MAC. I had heard many people rant and rave about this eyeshadow, and since they were finally affordable, I caved to see what the big deal was. Even though I was able to nab this product for $4.80/color it was still a huge waste of money....I purchased colors:- Half Baked: A mediocre brown. Wasn't over glittery like many other colors, but wasn't better than my usual makeup, either.- Kiddie Pool: An okay teal. Again, wasn't over glittery like many other colors, but wasn't better than my usual makeup, either.- Mary Jane: This was my favorite color of the bunch. Was shimmery but not glittery and went on very smooth. A pretty silvery blue.- Midnight Cowboy: This is supposedly their most popular color, and I do not understand how. This color is horrendous and is practically SOLID glitter. I ended up with so much glitter ALL over my face. Epic fail.- Midnight Cowboy Rides Again: Another disaster. Overly glitter and just an overall hot mess.- Midnight Cowgirl: I liked this color. It's a bit into the yellow tones for my liking as a go-to neutral color, but it highlights the eye area nicely. However, it is very glittery and difficult to apply because of the fallout.- YDK: An okay brown. Not atrocious like some of the others, but I'm still not going to pick it over my usual brand of makeup.- Strip: This is a nice velvety and shimmery vibrant gray. I liked this color. It was easy to apply and didn't contain chunks of glitter.- Purple Haze: Horrendous. Doesn't blend at all. Impossible to apply and spread evenly onto eyelid. This seems to be a problem with their purple tones...- Psychadellic Sister: Blech. Does not spread onto eyelid evenly, there are always bald spots, and I use a professional and expensive eyelid primer. Again, this is a purple color, and their purples, for whatever reason, are garbagey and do not spread.- Ecstasy: Another purple. Slightly better than the other purples but needs multiple, multiple applications to sort of be applied evenly. Texture is just funny, I don't know what is wrong with their purple dyes...So, out of 11 products, I have 3 that I actually like and use (Mary Jane, Midnight Cowgirl, and Strip), 3 that are mediocre but not stellar enough to make it into regular rotation (Half Baked, Kiddie Pool, and YDK), and 5 that are trash-tastic and will be given to my 10-year old cousin for dress-up play-time (Midnight Cowboy, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, Purple Haze, Psychadellic Sister, and Ecstasy)."
34370,2,I'm a cancer survivor who lost most of my eyebrows during my chemotherapy treatment. I thought this product would be the answer I'd been searching for but after using it for over a month I see no new growth. This was not only a waste of money but it got my hopes up for nothing.
185587,0,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love the nail polish. Not to mention - the price cannot be beat! It was of the quality I expected BUT it was different than the one I had at home. I had bought it at the nail salon and fell in love with it. It goes on very sheer with a nice shimmer and is great for the summer, however, the one I had at home is not as pink as the one I ordered. So, if you're looking for a color that you already have don't be surprised if the one you order on line is a bit different. I have to say though, for the price, the slight difference in color is not a big deal."

When are companies going to get with the program that we don't want that on our skin?I would rather purchase a product with a 6 month expiration date and 'natural' preservative than a 2 year date with harmful ingredients.I'm starting to purchase my skin care from UK because they are more 'with it' when it comes to ingredients that absorb into our skin. Come on America, we can do better!"
10042,1,"Holy mac, I am super pleased with the range of colors available and especially the savings under the subscribe and save program. This product is also great as it is 10 minutes maximum, no dangerous chemicals (no peroxide or ammonia) which means this is not a Level 3 graded coloring. the colors are very good and my scape is not left itchy after use and easy to rinse off.I am buying this is because it is my preferred brand and now it has become a whole lot easier to buy: before, I had to scout for the weekly discounts in my local drug stores. Now for the same savings, all i have to do is press a few buttons. Love it."
41485,2,"I couldn't wait for this dryer to arrive. However, when it did, I not only found it cumbersome to use, but it burnt my hair.

If you decide to try it, proceed with caution."

112928,2,"The original 7oz.Milk and Honey Body Lotion, as advertised, is not what was sent to me. The lotion, as well as the botttle, are different than advertised. The old formula was non-greasy,was absorbed into the skin quickly and smelled very good. The original was so smooth and grease-free, I could even use a little before playing guitar, if my hand was too dry. The new 8oz.lotion sent to me was greasy, tacky and it seemed to never go away. Do you know how packing grease feels? Yucky is the best way I can describe it. I'll NEVER use it. Making it orange doesn't help either; more yuck! I've been buying up all the old formula I can get my hand on, but eventually I'll have to find another lotion to use. I think it's pretty crappy, but others may love it. Like they say, if it's not broken..... Hey, life goes on."
63199,0,This is a decent eye cream but nothing special. The one thing that I find very annoying is that when the pump stops dispensing product there is at least two weeks worth of product left in the bottom of the bottle. Just remove the cap and scoop what you need with a cotton swab. Can't help but wonder if this is deliberate on the part of the company to make customers replace the product sooner! Hmmm....

174962,2,"I have sandy-red hair--now mixed with plenty of light gray at the crown, and around the face. Over 40 years ago, I started regularly using straight powdered henna (to intensify my red, and to add body and shine). About 3 years ago, I migrated to Surya dyes--first, out of curiousity (because I try anything *henna*), and then stayed with it, because of its terrific ease of use.For me, at least, the verdict is now in:The best thing about this product is how easy and quick it is to apply, and rinse out (compared with alternatives.)I mix this color with *Dark Reddish Blonde* and obtain a very natural-looking sandy red. Used by itself, it simply does not cover gray (unless you'd count a dusty yellow tinge. *Golden Brown*, um, no.) Any of the Red/Reddish colors (which do cover gray) will turn you into Ronald McDonald (with fading pinkish tones--ew!) when used alone.At this point, I have to apply every couple weeks--because, yes, a skunk line appears. I get some degree of boosted shine and softness--but this IS NOT A HENNA. Check the ingredients: Henna extract is down near the bottom of a very long list (way behind jasmine, and even after carrot juice). I don't have enough chemistry to decipher the other additives.Natural full-strength Henna (e.g., Rainbow-brand henna) is messy and time-consuming. But also remains, IMHO, the gold standard for safety, color, shine, body, and durability."

109496,0,"This brush is larger than what I expected and too large for me. It does work well for blow drying is it is quite effective at pulling hair tight and allowing for style control while still being gentle enough not to pull your hair out. This brush has made my hair very very prone to static problems, but in its defense I have only used it in the New England winter and this may be less of a problem in humid environments. This brush is probably a decent choice if you aim to volumize your hair while you blow dry it. Since I have 22 inch thick hair I dont need extra volume and it leaves my hair looking a bit too big."
71512,0,"Clean and Clear's Continuous Control Acne Cleanser is your typical run of the mill benzoyl peroxide wash. I can't tell if I like this product or not since it worked very well within the first week or two of use but then I started to get one of the worst break outs I have had on my face in quite some time. It is still going away. Maybe that was just because final exams were rolling around in school but, either way I have a couple issues with this product.First and foremost, the ingredients contain petrolatum, a petroluem based jelly. I can't help but feel that putting in petroleum jelly which can further aggravate acne in a good chunk of people with more sensitive skin to be a bit counter-productive. I am sure that for those without sensitive skin issues that the petrolatum would be no issue. I am guessing this contributed to my problem because the amount of the solid ""gunk"" that could be seen in my pores increased. I know some of you know what I am talking about.Second, I feel it takes a pretty good sized glob to get a good lather going. Otherwise it feels like I am rubbing mostly water on my face. With a small blob the cleanser just gets watery and runs down my arms, which is annoying I must admit. It's tough to find the ""right amount"" for this product.I decided to ditch this product for Stiefel Labs' Panoxyl. Much nicer ingredients list and I have used it before and been very pleased with the effects."

7028,0,"I had a little trouble with these getting shipped on time and had to contact the seller about it a week after they were ordered. However, they promptly sent them with a tracking number and politely emailed me a few days later about it to apologize.As for the washcloths themselves, I can't say that I'm very impressed. I got these more for face washing and wanted something thinner than the overly-thick ones you commonly see in stores. However, I will probably be using these to remove scary, green-looking facial masques instead, so as not to ruin good washcloths, and buying new ones for daily use.They're made in India and fairly well constructed, but also very thinly woven and to the point where you can see your hand through the material. They're also quite rough as a result, so probably not the best for daily use when it comes to your skin. They remind me quite a bit of the cheap towels used in bars or restaurants, or a utility towel, rather than a washcloth, and would probably be better used as such if you're looking not to destroy better-looking towels for messy cleanup jobs."
228313,1,"I bought this before a few years ago and just ordered it again yesterday. I bought it for my man and he loves it so much that he wanted another one. I love to smell it on my man too. :o) I looked all over the place and could not find it. I think I bought the first one at SAMS years ago, and I don't see it there anymore. I bought him another Hugo Boss cologne, and he didn't like it as much as this one. Anyway, I'm so glad I found it here at Amazon."
200515,0,"I found this when we went to a hotel, loved the size and convenience. Thought if the hotels use them they must be good quality. I bought one and was wonderful for a couple of years then the switch broke, so I bought 2 more, one to replace the broke one and one for guest bath. Just received them on Aug. 6 and the switch on the low setting already broke. Did not last a full month. Will look for others."
112536,1,"I have worn Tricorn cologne by Caswell Massey ever since I was in college over twenty years ago; and it's really a wonderful scent. It smells, predictably, of some citrus, but the citrus scent is somehow chemically toned down and there's just a hint of baby powder added into the scent. It's very elegant; and it keeps its scent for a good full day or evening.Because I love Tricorn so much, I recently decided to purchase the ""spray on"" version of this cologne. It works great! Be sure, however, not to spray too much too fast--you'll smell overwhelmingly of cologne. That can easily turn people off-I remember from my college days!This makes Tricorn a good value--you really don't need to use a lot each time you apply it; so the bottle lasts longer than you'd think it would. Tricorn is wonderful cologne for guys who want a very masculine cologne that's also just a bit different. It'll help you attract the right people, for sure!"

It is black and when it is wet it waves up and I am able to keep the wave look by applying mosturizer and protein styling gel. It looks healthier already and it has grown alot already. That was probably all that I needed. Someone told me that geratol grew their hair out as well. You may have to take this product for about year to have hair down your back."
198335,2,I would not purchase this again. Only used a handful of times and broken already.

183046,2,"Only got a star b/c i had to, I would give this zero stars. I cannot believe it is not illegal to sell this product.Please do not buy antibacterial items with the active ingredient listed as Triclosan. Products such as this lead to more and more antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, MRSA for example. Please, for the health of yourself and your family...DO NOT BUY! The problem is, we treat people with Trichlosan for a bacterial infection. If you go rubbing it on your body all the time, guess what, when you get sick your little bacteria buddies have developed a tolerance to it and will not die when you take the drug. Just use regular soap and as hot as you can stand water and you will be fine. In a hurry alcohol based products are fine to use because we don't treat bacterial infections with alcohol."

So incredible its cult like in its following. I know Auric Blends isn't stupid and they haven't changed the fragrance... but the last bottle of roll on I got from PENNY LANE GIFTS here on Amazon was BAD. It smelled like unscented oil w/ a little TINY hint of Egyptian Goddess. Amazon, hold PENNY LANE accountable for selling us defective stuff! I want my money back... or at least the same roll on stuff I got last summer from Tom's Incense. I'm ordering it directly from Auric Blends website so I can actually smell like the real stuff."

But easy to spread after i rub with my palm.. I wll update for the satisfaction how its work for me...Today i just remember, that when the first time i open the jar, the content was not full, there is a hole like the egg size.. Wondering why..?By the way the butter moisturising my skin a lot.. But still i have a lot eczema on my arm.."
125514,1,"I really like this perfume. I just bought it. GREAT for summer because it smells so tropical. Its got a hint of a mocha smell (dont worry..u wont smell like coffee or anything) its a very nice mocha smell...along with some other tropical fragrances. The good thing about Ralph Lauren frangrances is it contains real oils, and no synthetics...so the frangrance will last all day! (this is true for Armani too). If you want a great, long lasting, mocha/tropical fragrance for a hott summer smell..this fragrance is for u!"

214283,1,"BRIEF OVERVIEW: I have 4a/b type natural hair and after much consideration not really to do with pricing because I am a product junkie and have ordered way more expensive stuff that didn't work but more so based on reviews. So when I received a special offer in the mail for the WEN sample kit I ordered it and immediately called and opted out and cancelled the recurring monthly shipments they put you in when you sign up and had no issues. I ordered the Sweet Almond scent and have had it for over a month as I was waiting to try out some other products I had. In between that time and now I have read tons of reviews and to my dismay most of the reviews I read stated the Fig scent works best on black hair so I finally decided to just order the Fig from Amazon to see what works better. Most people have had great results the second time they used the product and since it's a new month I can now try something else and see if it works. So here is what I did:MY CLEANSING PROCESS:1. Detangled and separated my hair in four sections2. Pre-poo for a couple of hours(I always prepoo regardless of whether I shampoo or cowash)3. Rinsed with cool water as stated on the bottle for 2 minutes (this was a little strange for me as I always do my first rinse with warm water and last rinse with cool water by the way I actually used a timer because I wanted to follow instructions exactly so I can accurately state how the product worked following the directions)4. After rinsing I went to work on applying the product to each section. It recommends minimum 8 pumps for each section so I did 10 for the bottom half and 15 for the upper half since the front of my hair is thicker than the back. I did the left side with the Fig and the right side with the Sweet Almond. I had a spray bottle filled with cool water on hand so that I could spray my hair after applying and working the product through my hair and then I massaged my scalp for each section.5. I then put my deep conditioning cap on to allow product to sit on hair, it recommends minimum of 10-15 mins but it also states the longer the better so I left for a full hour.6. Rinsed each section with cool water7. Used the remoist mask treatment and left that on overnight and rinsed in the morning.8. After rinsing use 2 pumps of the fig cleanser and applied to my hair as leave in then I did my regular styling routing with moisturing and sealing.RESULTS: I'm honestly shocked this stuff worked!My hair looked and felt better than before I used it. I am a product junkie and I have tried so many products so I was not expecting this stuff to deliver any good results like everyone else has been experiencing but here it is two days later and my hair is still soft! This is the first time I've used a cleansing product that actually left my hair feeling better than I expected. HOWEVER I must say that I really really really really love the way the Fig cleanser worked on my hair better than the Sweet Almond. The Fig cleanser had soooooo much more slip than the sweet almond and it gave me more of a tingling sensation when I massaged my scalp verses the Almond. I will use both cleansers and if I continue to have good results and end up repurchasing I will definitely be getting Fig cleanser not the Sweet Almond. Something else I will not be getting is the Remoist Mask Treatment. I actually liked the way my hair looked and felt better than BEFORE I put the remoist on so I will skip purchasing that.REVIEW: So for first time use this gets 4 stars as it ""suprisingly"" delivered what I was looking for, the Fig edged out the almond and took the 5 star spot for me. I will continue to use the rest of the month and will monitor if I see any changes or differences (hair falling out as some have said) and give a final update on how good the product worked over a month's time."
221588,1,"This is my first curling/straightening iron.I have read the reviews before buying it. But I have decided to go on with purchasing it because money-wise, it is a good deal to try out.This is nor perfect. like many reviews have mentioned, the straightening works. but the curling part, don't expect it to curl a lot like what the saloon does. instead, it can provide some wave at the bottom end of your hair.Since I just want to curl the bottom-end of my hair inwards and create some loose-wave, it works for me.However if I'd like to create any proper curl, i'd buy a separate curling iron.overall, if you don't have a high expectation and want a more natural feel of the effect it brings, this is a good buy."

33851,2,"It does not help & is a piece of garbage. Even if you wanted this for interesting electro sensations, it's garbage. Get a tens unit & pads for this type of therapy or kicks, not this ""hocus pocus"" trash. The electrodes are not ajustable as it says in the intructions, so if you try to adjust them as per instructions, you'll just break it. It's very hard rigid plastic with hard metal electorodes sticking out... very uncomfortable. It will not sit an any head for even contact or comfortably. It will leave lots painful dents on your face for a long time. It's useless for beauty, therapy, or kicks."
198520,0,"This flat iron was not my best experience. It worked pretty well for nearly two years. It straightened hair fairly well and didn't seem very damaging at all. It seemed like just another great product from Chi.But then suddenly it started to slowly flicker on and off, then eventually, it just stopped turning on. I tried taking it apart to fix it, since the warranty expired by the time it broke, and everything internally seemed completely fine, though I did notice some very audible rattling inside the GFI adapter, and I'm assuming that the poor build quality of it ultimately led to the flat iron not turning on. Just try to be careful when unplugging the GFI adapter and dropping it on hard ground. I'm ASSUMING if you avoid this, this flat iron will continue to work for several years. This problem seems to affect a lot of flat irons.I was hoping for the price, I would get a little more use out of it, but that was not the case. I actually had a vastly better experience with the original Chi than this one."
129435,2,"I scanned other reviews for this product hoping to find anyone who mentioned whether it was effective at removing waterpoof mascara. Everyone says it's ""gentle"" and ""non greasy"" and ""non irritating"", etc. All true. BUT if doesn't even come close to removing my mascara....doesn't even make it smudge. Of course, I use an awesome waterproof mascara (tarte) that won't come off while swimming. So I was looking for a remover that could tackle that job - and this one couldn't. I do agree that it's gentle, non irritating, etc. And it's probably great at taking off eyeshadow (if you wear it)."

133083,2,"I wish this product would have worked for me. After scouring the internet for a good tea tree shampoo that would help alleviate the symptoms of my on again/off again itchy scalp (which may very well be stress-related, but oh well) I found Nature's Gate and used both the Tea Tree Calming shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks. At first, it seemed like my itchiness had subsided but just about the third week, the itchiness came back and it was worse than it had been before. I tried phasing out the shampoo and started just using the conditioner in combination with one of my old anti-dandruff shampoos. It helped a little, but not enough. I soon had to scrap both the shampoo and conditioner and try something entirely different. Not wanting the bottles to go to waste, I gave them to my boyfriend, who will pretty much use any shampoo. However, after a few days, his normally flake-free scalp started getting itchy and flaky as well. He ended up just throwing them out. I was so disappointed because it really seemed like it was doing it's job for a while. And I just loved the nice, clean smell. If there were a lotion that smelled like this, I would snatch it up in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner did the exact opposite of what they were supposed to do as my scalp remained both irritated and flaky and far from calm."
177052,2,"The product separated, it was old and smelled bad, a very big disappointment. I would never purchase again, how can they charge this much."

62687,1,"I am always trying to find a good face moisturizing product, notably, one where I don't wake up in the morning with a break-out from the moisturizer. So far, this Blue Copper 5 seems good. Convenient, not too oily, just enough moisture. Not sure if it meets up to it's description of promoting younger looking skin, but, I have been getting compliments lately on how young I look. Not sure if it's coincidence or something else I'm doing."

I will order from them again."

206849,2,"I had bought Swisspers locally and they were great for cleaning the face. They were smooth of one side and quilted on the other. I threw away the packaging and did not know exactly which version I had bought. When I ran out, I found the local store no longer carried them. So, I decided to order them but the product did not meet my expectations. They fall apart in one use and are really to small to clean the face. I was very disappointed, but it was not worth returning since I did not want to pay for shipping a second time. In the future, I will save the packaging for products I like until I find a replacement."
157725,0,"I've been eying this product for a while now and finally gave in after reading several good reviews about it. I tried it first without any mascara and it didn't curl my lashes at all. After putting mascara on, it was able to curl my lashes slightly, and after fiddling around with it for a bit I was able to get it to curl my lashes significantly (but only after first curling with a standard curler and putting on a second coat of mascara). The good thing about this heated lash curler is that you are able to curl those small corner lashes that you normally wouldn't be able to get with a standard lash curler. It also combs out any clumps of mascara and gives a natural curl instead of that crimp you get with a normal eyelash curler. The curl also lasts longer than a curl achieved with a standard curler. But unfortunately, it doesn't really curl your lashes by itself. I've tried different techniques and even looked at a few videos/tutorials and no matter how I use it, when I compare my lashes that have been curled with this heated lash curler and my lashes that have been curled with a standard lash curler, there is no significant difference. My lashes aren't any more curled, longer, or faux lash-like, in fact they look almost exactly the same (except for that crimp you get with a regular curler of course). It also takes longer to curl your lashes with this than it does when you use a regular lash curler. All in all, I think it's okay.. I wouldn't say it's any better than a standard lash curler. I guess I should have listened to all the other reviews.. if you already own a lash curler, save your money.. this one isn't anything special."
121597,2,This product is a sample which can be obtained from many department stores for free.
139515,2,"I really looked forward to putting waves in my hair with this. The size of the waves would have been so perfect. The problem is that it never got hot enough. It would get warm and I would have VERY mild waves that would completely disappear no more than 90 minutes later. I would even use lots of extra time on each wave--if I used just the standard amount of time I use with any other styling device, it wouldn't hold at all. I also put hairspray on before I used it which would normally be somewhat dangerous with products that heated up to a normal temp and still it barely workedIt wasn't just theRevlon RV084C 3-Barrel Jumbo Waver with CeramicI had originally purchased that was defective. I so loved the design that I exchanged it at the store I purchased it for another one. The replacement didn't warm up either.The ones that gave this 5 stars must have seriously thin hair."
19306,1,"I am partial to the Bare Escentuals bareMinerals line. This was the first bareMineral line I used and they only one I came back to after trying others brands. This product has a spf 15 and everyone needs this kind of protection. The formula is light and never cakey. It has been my experience that the chance of a break out using this foundation is minimal. It doesn't settle into every wrinkle on the face. It blends very well on the skin and the shades are easily matched to one's skin tone. I have used this whenever I need just a very light makeup coverage. This foundation glides onto the skin and looks very natural. But if you are looking for a heavier powder foundation that gives more coverage, then this probably isn't for you. I use another brand when I need more coverage. All in all, this is my go to coverage for those days when I only want a little color."
85164,0,"the product is pretty much worth the money, smells very cool, and fresh yet vanishes very fast feel as if you did not wear any in the first place. ideal for work and school. the fragrance does not bother other, it is rather refreshing."
216395,0,"A bit heavy, good for keeping in the car if you are in and out. That's it. Nothing to write home about."
245389,0,"I have oily skin and this product is too heavy for day time use. It makes my skin look shiny and does not allow my mineral powder to be applied evenly as it sticks to the lotion making the powder look cakey (I wait about 20-30 minutes after applying moisturizer). This product works fantastically as a night ""cream"" especially in the winter months. For day time I would recommend Ideal Image matte moisturizer with SPF 30. It really solves the oil problem while moisturizing AND providing sun protection. Also, the list price for this Neutrogena product is not $19.99...there is not one store I could find online or otherwise selling it at that price so don't be fooled by the supposed discount % advertised."
200987,0,"It smells really good. I wore it the gym and a couple of bars and not one number or attention! It's weird because it worked for my mom, she got a $500 bonus check. I guess It depends on your luck"
128736,0,"Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Pads 60 padsthis product really has helped clear my skin up and get the dead skin off, when you work up to using it daily it makes a real difference in the texture of your skin."
231656,0,"I bought this product for my arthritic hands. I idea is great - I didn't want the product to cover my fingers as I was applying it so the roll-on fit the bill. The problem I experienced was that not always does the product flow from the roll-on head as I'm applying it. Sometimes shaking the bottle helps, sometimes not. Increasing the pressure on the head while applying doen't help. Hit or miss whether the product flows out so it can be quite frustrating. When it does, it feels cool and helps the pain a bit. Don't think I'd buy it again."
95494,2,I didn't give this product a high rating because it takes about 15 min. to heat up which is a lot in my book. When it is done with that it curls your hair but it eventually falls apart. If you touch the curls or someone else does your hair just getts frizzy and wavy. If you want curly hair you should get a perm or a more expensive curling iron but no this product. Maybe it works if your hair is naturally curly but mine isn't so it didn't work wll at all.

( I saw some old pics showing that color but maybe they change the formula , and actually that old color became "" Who the Shrek are you ? but a little darker ""- If you have ever seen "" one star "" as a rate for it, it's absolutely because of the thin annoying formula that requires 3 coats ( I felt disappointed at first because I'm always in a hurry )Anyway, the result makes you forget all that drama &lt;3Hope my review helps you to decide ;)"

127614,1,"The clipper itself works great. Yes, it is a little loud, but it's an electric hair clipper. I would not expect it to be whisper-quiet any more than I would expect a silent lawn mower.My clipper arrived with one of the guide combs missing teeth. I emailed Wahl and immediately got a response that a replacement was being sent; no back and forth, no climbing the CSR ladder and having the blame moved to Amazon. Immediate action and great customer service."

I'm not wild about the smell, either. And if you're a makeup wearer, you definitely need something stronger (even if you use makeup remover beforehand)."
130424,1,"One of my favorites!!! It's ALL sparkles! It goes on white and is full of sparkles so it looks silver, but is not. I couldn't keep this on my fingers long enough. I love the ULTRA SPARKLES OPI puts in some of its polish, like this one."

228777,1,"I have used this product for many years because I have very dry skin and my doctor told me that lanolin (from sheep) is the most like human skin oil and will penetrate better than other oils. He's right! I have never found anything that leaves my skin as moist and supple for hours afterward. It does feel a bit ""greasy"" at first but that goes away in moments and with it the feeling of ""tightness"" that dry skin has. I carry the small tubes in my purse to use on my lips and hands during the day to prevent cracking and on my whole body after bathing. If I don't, I get calluses on the edges of my heels that crack and bleed, but with this lotion my feet stay normal and soft. Now I am panicking because the place that used to make it - B&T Labs - seems to have gone out of business. I usually order by the gallon and my last order was returned undeliverable. Lets hope this source has plenty of stock!"

It doesnt ""tan"" the skin, its just topical. I will go back to using a lotion that actually dyes the skin and gives color for a few days. this product works for if you want to look tan at the time you put it on, not for days after."
119044,2,"I have fine, thin hair. Thought this was just what I needed to blow dry daily. bristles are clear plastic and poke out at least 1/2 inch. The brush works, but is fairly cheaply made, and the bristles are just annoying to me. They scratch, are very stiff and poke my scalp when the brush is rolled against my head.I would NOT buy this again."
31502,0,I love smelly soaps. Especially the spicy earthy ones. The scent of this soap was just okay. I actually ordered two different kinds. Both smelled very similar to each other. It didn't have a lasting scent either.
161655,0,I'm a dad so hair dryers are completely foreign to me. Bought this for my daughter and when her mom saw it I got scolded as it's small enough that hair may be able to be sucked in causing some very bad times.I would say it works. She would say it doesn't work well enough. 3/5 stars as there are a few glaring issues if it's not only for a last resort.
223680,0,The powder is wonderful. I have been unable to find it in stores so went looking for it on-line. I was very pleased to find it at a reasonable price. The picture is misleading.

178932,0,"I am feeling ambivalent about this hand cream. On the plus side, I LOVE how quickly it sinks into my skin, making my hands moisturized but not greasy. On the other hand, though, the smell is really off-putting. I don't tend to mind scented products, but this just smelled bad to me (and to my roommate, who commented on the odor about 30 minutes after I had applied it - it lingers!). I also felt that the moisture was not long-lasting. Obviously I'm not expecting to be able to wash my hands a hundred times before my skin gets dry again, but I had to reapply this cream to my hands after each wash. That was a hassle. I almost wonder if I got a bad batch or an expired product because everyone else has nothing but nice things to say about this lotion. Overall, I think I'll use up the rest of my tube and then not repurchase, as this just isn't my favorite."
220537,1,"I've been using the Murad Resurgence system since it came out. I can't say enough good things about it. My skin color & texture even out when I use Resurgence. Due to finances a while back I had to find a cheaper system, the blotchiness came back. I looked tired all the time. Now I'm back & I'm staying. Amazon makes it affordable. I'm almost 60 yrs old & my face looks like I'm 45!!Enough said."

18840,0,"unfortuneately, the last three bare minerals products i have bought, all have a flaw in the locking mechanism. Where in my makeup bag, it will unlock and dump alot of product in the top. Then when you open it, powder goes everywhere. If it happens to you with the &#34;warmth&#34;...be prepared to live with that stain. I love bare minerals and thought it was a wonderful idea to put the lock on there, to avoid loss or stain. When it first changed they used to stay locked, seemed to work well. But now, why put it on there if it doesnt stay locked? I am living with a stain now, when you wet it...try to clean it...it gets worse."
57094,0,"For a daily use moisturizer, Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer has a surprisingly thick, greasy feel to it. Probably if used according to the directions on skin still wet with Zia Toner it's consistency would be much improved. It is, on the other hand, a very good moisturizer."
204284,2,I was on 3rd box of #5 med brown just for men and liked how it worked just fine .Then I bought 3 boxes of #5 at one time noticing the box was different this time . After using I was itching and getting sores all around where product was used on face and neck areas ! After a few heal and try again periods . It is definitely just for men burning and making oozing sores wherever used ! Looking online I see MANY men saying the same thing !! If the ok'd formula worked fine and the new is burning people ... Why would they keep it and not go back to older better formula !! Jeez
125923,2,"It doesn heat as much to make good curls, is for very long hair, in general I dont like the product at all. I cant use it"
42641,0,"I like the fact that this mascara is long wearing. It stood up great, even when I forgot to take it off before I went to bed! However, I found it to be clumpy, and the coverage was only so-so. I don't think I'll continue to use this particular product or recommend it to my friends."
119281,0,"This deodorant rolls on really easily. It doesn't pass the Indian Summer sweltering heat test. It doesn't last. it works perfectly fine for everyday use where you won't sweat through heavy exertion or exercise, but if you exercise or get caught in a very hot day, it needs to be reapplied. That's why, for my needs, it's average or just okay. I've found better: Tom of Maine's Natural Deodorant Stick Calendua. I wish it came in roll-on, but it really lasts -- even under exercise sweat and 90-degree heat."
45467,1,"Received the purchase very quicky, perfect transaction!! I will buy from you again since I can't find this perfume in stores."
130306,0,"When I compare this to other palettes that I have used it feels flimsy. This can be good for the total weight it adds but bad because the white plastic inserts don't seem like they would hold up in air travel well. I did not hot pour my lipsticks into this because I was afraid it might warp. I just used a spatula and swabbed in into place, then used a label maker to add the swatch names to the divider. I think this is just ok, nothing to rush out and buy, there is probably a better option out there."

156874,1,"Best, longlasting, cologne I ever purchased. Cheap too and i looooove it on my boyfriend. I'm scared if other girls like it too much too. haha"
42704,0,"This scent has a strong powdery, sweet smell, not floral and woodsy like, say, Eternity by Calvin Klein. This is more like Obsession for Women. Three stars given because husband likes it and it's long lasting. Purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves it."

108159,2,"The color showed in the picture is not the same as the color they sent me. The one I received (and unfortunately I bought 2 of them) is much darker. So they are sitting in my make up case, maybe one of my friends might like it and they can have it."
232495,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."
198964,2,I purchased this CHI flat iron in June and it has already quit working. I learn today when I check return policy that the return date expired in July. I am very upset because this is not a cheap flat iron. We are not talking fifteen dollars we are talking $100.00 dollars. I will never purchase something like this again on Amazon. I will go through my hair stylist from now on. So in other words I have thrown 100.00 out the window.
125480,2,"I use Clinique Dramatically Different during the summer but when the dry Arizona winter hits, I need something stronger so I bought Aveeno SPF30. Because I never have any trouble with Clinique burning my eyes, I did not hesitate to rub the moisturizer all over my face including my eyes. I have had lotions that burned before but nothing like this!!! I washed my eyes to no avail. It burned for hours!!! The very least Aveeno could do is to put some kind of warning not to use on the eye area - but there is NOTHING!! I will never buy Aveeno anything ever again!!"
147343,2,"These are basically disposable hair clippers, because Remington doesn't sell replacement blades. Plus the blade doesn't last very long at all. So these clippers will end up where mine are going. The landfill!!! I wish that wasn't the case, but I have no other choice. I tried using half a bottle of lubricating oil, which I specifically bought for these clippers, thinking that was the problem. It made absolutely no difference. DON'T let the Titanium name fool you either. I saw the name Titanium & it made me think strong & durable. The unit itself may be strong & durable, but the blade is not. The first few times it works really good & is pretty quiet. That will explain many of the positive reviews. People try it once or twice & write their review. After 4 or 5 times using these clippers. I started feeling a slight pulling on my hair. Then I needed to start going slower & slower to allow it to cut. Now it just catches on my hair & will barely cut at all. It is a shame that I have to throw the clippers out, because they don't sell replacement blades. I checked all over & even went to a site that just sells replacement parts. There were no matches for this model. If I had a new blade. These clippers would be as good as new. You would think with everyone going green. That Remington would give you a chance to buy new blades, but they don't. Until they change that or make the blade more durable. You should avoid buying this clipper set. Take my advice & spend a little more money or buy a different model. If I had the money I would buy what the professionals use, which is Oster clippers. Oster sells replacement blades & are made to last a lifetime (If you take care of them properly), which is why they cost so much. I just don't have the money to buy them right now, but if you do. You should really think of buying a oyster hair clipper set.Look at some of the other reviews on this clipper set. I am not the only one complaining that the blade gets dull fast. I am only writing this review now, because I am looking for a new clipper kit to replace these ones. You shouldn't expect to use these clippers for more then a few months, if that. If you spend a little more money. You can buy clippers that will last a few years. Just make sure to read ALL the reviews both good & bad."

3064,2,I saw this product featured on ET and wanted to see what the hype is. I am an Esthetician and always look at ingredients. Anything you apply to your skin will absorb into your body. The majority of the ingredients In this product are parabens( preservatives). These do nothing to beautify the skin. they just give a long shelf life. Reasearch is showing that they also mirror hormones in the body and may contribute to breast cancer in some women. Please read what you are putting in your body. Not good!
45731,0,Smoldering Plum is a very universally flattering shade. It works for my tanned skin as well as lighter skin tones (ladies at the gym). Last a good 4-6 hours. I've since upgraded to more lasting brands.
176220,0,Since I received the product I had one pimple that I was able to use the product on. It did not magically make the pimple go away. As a matter of fact I didnt notice any reduction in time from the clearing of the pimple. The jury is out because next time I will have to ensure that I apply the gel immediately upon realizing the onset of a possible pimple.

53588,0,I have had one of these for yrs. I love it. I need to get another.It is easy to use!!!
129334,0,Product did the job rather well. Very sharp. Was a little disappointed with the vendor's claim that clipper was manufactured in the USA. It in fact is manufactured in China. This makes a big difference as far as quality is concerned. I have to use it for a few months before I get a true picture of what it is worth.
185584,1,The Moonstruck is my favorite neutral Essie color. My order came quick and the polishes were in perfect condition. Definitely look forward to being a regular costumer.
235462,0,"After reading horrible reviews regarding this product, I decided to go ahead and try it.My hair: Completely color treated, golden blonde with some brassiness due to my natural red color. Upon using this product I had 1/4 inch of natural growth that is medium brown/red with some natural blonde highlights. My hair is long. It's been two months since I have dyed my roots.Results: NO CHANGE in hair color on my color treated hair or my roots. This product did not lighten my hair. My hair did feel softer, there was no damage, and it did reduce total frizz. It did fill in my dull ends that needed a trim, and made them fuller and softer.Shine: If you are looking for commercial grade shine, this isn't the product that will produce mega watt shine. Spots that had the most shine were areas of my head that were closer to my scalp where natural oil occurs such as: the underneath layer, front bang pieces, and my natural roots.Conditioner: The conditioner is wonderful, and will make your hair soft.My guess is those that have natural hair color that is not color treated will benefit most from this product.Would I use this product again? Yes, but not for a while since it DOES contain peroxide and can damage hair."

70369,1,"My daughter has very sensitive skin and many moisturizers burn when she puts them on her face.She is 10 yrs old, and loves this product. She puts it on her face before school in the morning, and we havebeen very pleased with this product. She also has extremely dry skin."
217126,0,I purchased this little curl wand because a friend of mine said it worked far better then a regular eye lash curler. However I don't feel it works as well. It may work better on someone with long lashes.
53906,0,"Believe them when they say extreme heat. Ends are too hot to touch and they burn my scalp unless I pad with cotton squares. It works better for me if I leave the lid up after they heat up. The U shaped clips that comes with the set are a joke. They don't hold the rollers at all. I'm looking to purchase the cage types clips to try with it. Other than that they work as well as any others and they are larger than most. I'm still hoping for 2 - 2 1/2"" rollers to hit the market."
24315,0,"The bag does have a lot of individual plastic bags but the whole bag itself is very narrow (3""). I will keep it and use it for smaller items but it is not very practical if you want to put your shampoo, moisturizer, face cleanser, etc. all in one bag. It won't all fit."
225959,2,"if you take a whiff of the stick, you find a pleasantly sweet apricot-like scent. mix that with perspiration and it indeed becomes sickly sour. if your aim is to amplify the b.o. effect, go right ahead and use this. there is something about mango, passionfruit and i suppose apricot/peachy scents that do not mix well with body sweat.that is my main complaint, but it is also true that even a moderately perspiring person will have to re-apply this throughout the day."
30091,0,I buy a lot of the derma e products and this one is not top on my list. It goes on wonderfully but soon your skin feels dry again. I wouldn't call it a wonderful moisturizer
158693,0,"I have always liked the Murad products,and I was hoping I could find something that would help my 40ish year old face look younger, but unfortunately, I have discovered I am allergic to this one."
85972,1,Works great. But I do have to reapply every couple of days or my 4 year old starts sucking on his fingers again.
169353,2,"I found it odd that the package said something to the effect of ""United Kingdom"" or ""England"" I was excited because I figured that they were made there then I looked at the actual scissors and they said pakistan. I called and inquired if I had received the correct product and was told yes. I waited until I needed another hair cut and then tried these out about a month later. They were absolute rubbish. They would not cut hair with out holding the hair taut and even then it was laborious to actually get them to cut through the hair. If the hair was not pulled taut the hair would just hold between the two blades. I would suggest just getting so high quality general household scissors. Not only did these not cut but they were very poorly finished, the handle looked like it was hand ground by a kid learning to use a grinding wheel; very rough and unevenly angled. Save yourself the time and headache.Five Stars for Amazon: They accepted the return on these without any hangup or complaint. I am so satisfied with Amazon I hardly go to the regular store anymore."
137788,0,"It doesn't leave your skin feeling very soft, but it's body wash-- your body gets washed, and that's about it!"
131907,2,The picture and description (and price) would have you think you are receiving multiple items but it is ONLY 1 tube of spf 30! It is $13 dollars elsewhere on amazon.
52536,0,"This was a Christmas present for my Mother who has been wearing this fragrance for many years. She always told me that the Parfum was the only one to get. This was labeled as Parfum but the Parfum never came in a spray so it must be a relabel or a knockoff so yes I am disappointed in the product I received for what I had to pay for it. I guess I wil have to investigate a product more before I purchase. Kind of thought that Amazon would not allow the sale of misrepresentations. Be wary, if this is a Parfum that you are familiar with, it is not the original one as sold by Cartier."
217959,0,"I have relaxed coarse dry hair. I heard nothing but good reviews on shea butter so I had to try it. Well let me just say that my hair does not like shea butter. It made my hair feel coated and just nasty. I tried it for apporximately two weeks and couldn't take it anymore. My skin had even started to break out everywhere my hair touched it. I am not sure why this happened because I use a sheabutter/oil mixture on my legs for softness and discoloration and that never broke me out. I am not going to say not to buy from this seller however, the product seemed authentic and was recieved in no time at all. It's just not the right product for everyone. Good Luck and Bleesings!P.S. I have been using jojoba oil and jamician black castor oil and had no adverse effects from them. If you're like me and couldn't use the shea butter give them a try."
166195,1,I love this mud mask. For me it's really refreshing. My skin becomes softer after applying this mask. I will definitely buy this again.
109079,0,"I have used this product only twice so far on a low setting, it seems to burn the ends of my hair each time that I have used it. I have very fine hair, so I would not recommend it to someone with fine hair."
197319,2,"I'm 99% sure that I purchased a knock-off ""chi"" flat iron. When I received it, I found that the cord connection was faulty, but I thought it may be a new safety feature - that the iron shut off automatically when the cord spun around (in case it fell off of a countertop onto the floor, for instance). This problem has gotten progressively worse and now it's hard to find a single cord position where the iron will stay ""on."" It takes me twice as long as it should to straighten my hair because the iron turns off in the middle of each stroke. I've only had this iron for three months - my last chi lasted for almost 5 years. In addition, the ""chi"" label on the iron is scratching off. I would NOT buy this again. VERY disappointing."
69897,0,"I've been using this product for almost 2 weeks. Of course I have not seen any improvement yet, and will update later if there are any changes to my dark spot. However, this thing stink so badly. It smelled like cooking oil with onion or garlic. The first time I applied it on my face I almost gagged. Thought about not using it, but then I decided to give it a try. So i'm using this under my moisturizer that have a pleasant fragrance. I still can smell it, but it was a lot better. Wish they would do something about the terrible odor."
115830,0,This smells quite a bit like the demeter fragrance Salt Air. I expected more of a seaweedy type of ocean smell.. instead this smells just strictly alkaline and wears off quickly.
44000,2,"This soap is o.k, but there is NOT much lather and your skin feels kind of weird after taking a shower. Not tight but funny.I cannot explain you have to try it to understand what I mean."
228009,1,"My natural color is a dark blonde, dyed it black. I got tired of dark colors looking flat when they fade and wanted to remove all the dark hair dye from my hair and bleach my hair a light blonde so I ordered 2 packs of this to start the lightening process.When lightening hair always start applying the product from the back to the front. Loreal Colorzap works very quickly so you will want to move fast, it helps to have two mirrors. I like to use my bathroom mirror and the mirror on the medicine cabinet to the side. By angling the mirror on your medicine cabinet you can see what youre doing in the back.Once all the product was on my head and I looked a sloppy mess I waited 15 minutes then rinsed it out with cold water.It did leave my hair feeling dry but nothing a good moisturizing treatment wont help with. I do not recommend leaving it longer than 15 minutes.I was about a level 2 or 3 before using Loreal Color Zap and this took me to a level 6, my hair looked orange (which is expected).I followed up with bleach, toned my hair and dyed it a natural light blonde hair color. Minimal damage and shiny results =).Customer Satisfied. Thanks!"
204415,1,"I got this in today and applied it. It tasted great. But what really got me was it lasted for hours!! Even the taste was there a few hours later. Not like the other stuff that comes off with a lick. This stuff, you can feel!! It sticks!!"
198790,1,"The Chi is supposed to be the best hair straightener out there. I haven't ever used anything else so I can't really compare, but I really like this product. Here the price was excellent. They can sell for over 150 dollars elsewhere and this one was 89. I would also recommend this model over others that do not have a temperature control."
112764,0,"I love the smell of tomato leaves, and I was hoping that this perfume would smell just like them. Answer-- not really. There's a little bit of an herbaceous, leafy sort of smell, but it's combined with kind of a generic floral scent. The smell is okay, I'm just disappointed that it's not what I was expecting."
164144,0,"Based on reading the other reviews, I suppose I had higher hopes. Thinking that maybe it was some type of ""miracle"" product. Once I received it, it just seemed liked any other pomade (grease) I've used in the past. Except it has a distinctive smell, not good or bad just unique. I like more floral smells myself. It seems more organic than most. Maybe it's geared more for people with locs or natural hairstyles. I have a relaxer so greasiness is of concern. Overall, I wasn't impressed, didn't see any significant improvement in hair quality or length. Just seems like something to buy if you're into the whole holistic lifestyle."
9268,0,"These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.Pros....They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair. They come with two sizes of curlers which allows you to have some creativity. There is 10 of each size which allows you to have enough of just one size curl if that is the look you are after. The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.Cons....No matter how hard I try I am unable to get curls without the clips creating lines in my hair. While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed. Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron. That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set."
118589,1,I have used this product for approximately two years and find it to be very effective. Was having difficulty finding it in stores and was very pleased it was available at Amazon.com
123408,1,"Special Effects hair colors are brilliant semi-perm dyes. The brand is fantastic for your alternative coloring needs! Napalm Orange is a personal favorite of mine. Fresh full applications over a well-lifted bleach will be an intensely rich safety-orange color not far off from the color in-bottle. After 8-12 washes it fades to a soft apricot blonde, which is very pretty but feels like straw. To avoid this, I mix 2 parts conditioner (I use Ion Color Defense Intense Moisture) to 1 part Napalm Orange and apply like normal. 20-30 mins will refresh the color to a vivid orange that's a about where it was after 2-3 washes as well as condition the heck out of it. This is great for making your color last with longer hair, as re-coloring it from scratch is a pricey pain.I haven't tried the conditioner dilution with any other SFX colors, but I can't imagine it not working across the brand. I'm anxious to try it after a fresh bleach, actually. You can get wonderful pastels with SFX and conditioner dilution!"
25998,1,"I have been using hair gels for the past 20 years and I have gone thru countless stores to try to find the perfect gel. My hair is straight and thick, after my hair is washed and dried it looks like a Chia pet head, thick and soft. The gels that I would buy would sometimes not last long enough thru the day or be that strong holding, and sometimes I have to use so much as to make my hair look like I dipped it in a barrel of oil. With this gel I only need to use a nickle sized amount and my hair stays and looks good for about 15 hrs. This product also does not flake, like some other ones..trust me you will not regret using this."
112509,0,"This Nars lip gloss is not the rich color of the Orgasm blush, which I use daily. Nars needs to work harder to get the color match better. I would not buy again. Just an OK gloss."
121654,0,This product is good but quality wasnt there broke not even a year. I wish it was bigger. I wouldnt buy it again. I think they should send me another free one. If they do I hope it doesnt crack on me.
66458,1,Great dryer! Drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies!Great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges
114691,0,"Item gets very,very hot, and there is no thermostat, only vents to open on the top, and that doesnt't work to reduce the temperature. The high and low settings only regulate the fan, not necessarly the heat. It is also quite loud. What did I say? Exactly! That's my point. Cheaply made, and I am very dissapointed. Damm those Chinese. But until I can find a better hooded dryer, I guess this will have to do."
124293,2,"Like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. I think it only happens with the atomizer. Perhaps exposure to air SOURED the perfume. I am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. The product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. I am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. I am never buying perfume from Britney Spears. Obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume."
14209,1,"I have used this peel about 5 or 6 times and use about tiwce a week. So far i can say that this really leaves your skin smooth and REALLY does shrink pores. This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face. It also did fade dark spot just a little bit the only thing it didn't do for me is to prevent new acne from forming. Not sure if that is bcos i am still in the ""it would get worse before it gets better stage"" but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel. I also alternate with TCA 10% peel so not sure if that could be it as well. Anyway overall this is a good product. And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength. I am also africam american and will recommend this for dark skin."
16414,2,"Size matters when it comes to cotton swabs. I've always spent the extra money to buy Qtips brand swabs, BUT NO MORE. My wife and I have noticed that the once large and fluffy cotton heads are now gone. There is NOTHING less satisfying than sticking what feels like a match head in your ear canal after a good hot shower. I've even tried 'fluffing' up the heads, but there's not even enough cotton on the tips anymore to do that! Very unfulfilling and all to save a buck - I'll take my earwax elsewhere..."
105848,0,"This perfume does smell clean but very un-natural. I was really going off of reviews here and don't get me wrong, the reviews are right. It smells clean like laundry but when I pull my clothes out of the dryer they smell not so harsh. I really hope this makes sense because this is a very fake clean smell. And the scent does fade really quick. REALLY quick. I feel that a scent should develop with you as the day goes on and you should catch fragrance bursts throughout the day as you move. After about 45 mn's this is completely gone. All of this being said it isn't a bad smell but once again, just a fake clean smell and it fades quick."
236630,0,I feel that the toe straightener could be a little less flexible on the sole as it does not remain in place at all times.
109649,2,"Dear Srs, We never received the second item and I see in the status that it was delivered both, please check and contact me, thanks you.We only received one.Thanks,Mi email: mauricio.mu@gmail.com"
244568,0,"I didn't really like the Biore Pore Perfect Skin Strips. I have very sensitive skin and while the strips did clean my pores it hurt to take them off and they left a red mark on my forehead and chin for about a day. I sure am glad I didn't have anywhere to go the next day or I would've been pretty embarrassed. I might recommend this product, but only for friends who don't have sensitive skin."
10999,2,"I have been using different gels, trying to find one that I liked. I was shopping at the cheaper end of Walmart and Target, but those didn't hold very long. However, among the cheap ones, LA Looks is the absolutely worst. Not only does it not last long, it is very, very flaky. When it comes to gel, it is worth paying the extra few dollars and getting a better one. I am using Fructis now, which costs about two dollars more for about half the amount, but it is absolutely worth it."
33316,2,"The mirror was broken when I received this case. I contacted the company and they immediately sent a replacement. The case was not what I expected. It does have a lighted mirror that I was looking for, but the case is way too small to carry on a trip. What with needing make up products and shampoos and lotions the case is just not big enough.I commend them for an immediate response and I would do business with this company again."
223404,0,I love this perfume. It is the only one that I have worn every winter for 10 years now. The smell stays even on the next day & the price at here is so much cheaper than drug stores that sell it $$. Thanks!
34353,1,I used to have very full brows all through my life - but with time & age they started to thin out and not grow out anymore. I thought that this is something that I have to live with and I would have to use pencil/powder to fill them out - until I came across Damone Roberts brow gain! My brows started to fill out and they look full and natural now. I do not need to use powder/pencil to fill them out now! They continue to grow and look wonderful!
66645,0,"It's just ok. It's very light, kind of hard to use to curl or straighten hair. I wouldn't buy it again if I had it to do over."
129705,1,"This is a standard but convenient set of rollers. The case and rollers are very cute and compact, the universal voltage and &quot;color change function&quot; of the rollers is pretty neat. Have fun with this. : )"
96960,0,"This scent has a strong powdery, sweet smell, not floral and woodsy like, say, Eternity by Calvin Klein. This is more like Obsession for Women. Three stars given because husband likes it and it's long lasting. Purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves it."
222887,0,So far it's too early to tell if I like The Revitalift yet. I do know it feels greasy to me. Doesn't absorb as well as some of the other reviews had said. This could be due to my oily skin though.
188181,0,"I normally wear Laura Mercier Foundation Powder no.7 but I usually buy it at Sephora. However,the one got from Amazon did not apply as smoothly. It was quite hard to get the product on the sponge. The package also looked a bit different. Will be purchasing this from the store from now on."
238053,1,"I have used Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap for several years -- probably at least 10 years by now. It is refreshing, clean smelling, and leaves my skin feeling great."
131411,2,"This basket arrived today and looks MUCH smaller than the one pictured. I did not receive the extra gift or greeting card mentioned in the title. I have not opened the poorly sealed clear wrap surrounding the basket, but I only see the towel, a sponge, a bag of something, and 3 upside down bottles. There may be something under the bottles, but I can't tell. There is a large amount of packing material. Right now, I do not see how I can possibly give it as the gift I had intended for it to be. I would be too embarrassed. My suggestion would be to assemble your own basket. Anyone could do a better job than this. See the two images of the one I received."
199351,1,I knew this perfume before i purchased it. I realized it was original not the impression or imitation of Eternity.
195573,1,"I am part of the no-lipstick generation, but now that our generation is degenerating into our ""mature"" years, I find that a little lipstick really perks up my appearance. However, I don't want to reapply it a dozen times a day--who has time for that? This lip color lasts all day. It really needs to be packaged with two tubes of the clear gloss, however, because that runs out long before the color tube does."
99901,0,"The haircolor is a very natural color and very easy to apply. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting something easy to do, with great color. The color hasn't faded and looks great!"
87022,0,"Works great on dry skin, better than any I've tried in this price range. It's very moisturizing and starts working the instant you put it on. I have only used it for one day but already I can see an improvement. The only reason it's not a 5-star product is because of the fragrance. Girls probably won't mind it but if you're a guy like me, it's actually really annoying. It clashes with your cologne. If it was unscented it would be 5-stars though."
160342,0,"This is my first Radiance purchase and I have used it for almost two months. It actually reduced the puffiness of my under eye area a little. But the dark circle have not shown any improvement, and it does not smooth the skin as described."
128033,0,"I was kind of disappointed when I ordered this as I was expecting to get the same ""Treat Elite Keratin Leave-In Treatment"" that I was used to, especially since the picture was the same one that I was used to getting, however the product has clearly changed as the packaging and the name is different. The package now only states Treat Elite, not Treat Elite ""Keratin"" Spray, no where on the bottle does it state that this product contains ""Keratin"" any longer. Although it did leave my hair feeling good, I will probably no longer buy this product anymore as I was wanting a ""Keratin"" leave-in conditioner, not just a regular leave-in conditioner. If you are looking for a Keratin Spray this is no longer it."
238718,1,"I think it's perfect scent while passing all the security andsophistication of an Armani, brings a lighter side of young people when you use.Love it"
130529,0,"So, I love OPI nail polish. I'm a huge puple fan! So, great combo for me. Unfortunately, this nail polish showed up half empty for leaking while closed tightly. Odd and disappointing! I used the rest as quickly as possible, because, as I guessed, this polish dried up quickly! Maybe it was just a faulty bottle, but I was so sad!"
110427,1,"I bought this after seeing the price and the reviews. I have to say, I LOVE this perfume. I can put it on in the morning and have it last 7-8 hours. It might last even longer but I'm not sure because my nose becomes immune to the scent quickly. Which is good, 'cause then I'm not smelling myself all day and running the risk of a headache!The first day I put it on a ton of women told me I smelled nice. They just loved it. Today another woman said the same. I told her I couldn't even smell it and she said that she could smell it well, that it smelled very pretty, and wasn't overpowering. She said it was just the right amount.When I can smell it, I also like the smell. It's a pleasant musk - hard to explain really. I can't say how it works on men because no male has said anything to me about it yet. My fianc&eacute; doesn't comment on things like that and I haven't thought to ask him. And really how often do random men tell you that you smell nice? Haha. I will definitely be purchasing again once I run out."
232481,0,"Finding and unscented soap is almost impossible. Even the Dove bar, although it says it is unscented, is actually not 100% unscented. Even when soaps say fragrance-free, they still may have scented oils or essential oils from natural substances. I know many bar soaps contain perfumes which they call fragrant oils. The essential oils are simply extracts from a particular plant, but can be very aromatic and give a sense of being scented. I have looked around for unscented soap and have only come across a rare few. Most of the time, unscented does not mean fragrance free. For really fragrance free soap, sungoldsoap is probably the best bet. You should look for unscented or fragrance free soap that is also a natural soap. Unfortunately, most of these soaps are not natural soaps that are made from natural oils and fats."
49429,0,"I'm 37, light combination skin, I saw the product on tv, did a little research and decided to give it a try but it didn't worked for me, it clogged my pores, making me to break out. The package looks really nice but not a good quality, too expensive!! Try Bare minerals, love it!Es un producto demasiado caro es de mala calidada, reseco' mi piel y tapo' mis poros, tengo 37 y piel clara normal,no gaste su dinero, no vale la pena."
14872,2,"The new formula has a different smell, texture, colour, shape, and size compared to regular pears soap. I prefer closer to the normal formula."
77591,0,"This was my favorite perfume and I was so disappointed when they stopped making it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered immediately. This perfume is similar, but not quite the original Vivid."
74965,1,"This stuff has an uplifting earthy aroma, but it is not an antipersperant. I find I need to use it 2 or 3 times a day. Thats not a bad tradeoff considering I'm not putting all thse weird chemicals on so close to my lymph nodes."
56454,1,"Such a huge fan of this color. It's so vibrant and bold, especially great for the fall and winter months."
38215,0,"Once fragance is sprayed on it last a minute,you can't smell it on your skin or clothes, I am very disappointed, Is this replica of Ralph Lauren"
122614,2,"I used this product for a year and I was not happy with it. I never really saw a difference or improvement with my hair after relaxing with it. Also, I must have been allergic to the product because every time I relaxed my hair I would get a rash close to my hair line. The rash would eventually disappear but it was definitely related to the product. I would have stopped using the product had I not spent so much money on it."
22809,1,I think it smells good and so does my boyfriend. My sister told me it smells like lemon and babies.... Not sure how to take that. It smells differently to different people I guess. It was cheap and different I do feel the scent fades too quickly.
239599,1,"this mirror is really light- so it's nice not to have another clunky thing in my purse. It's compact, nothing fancy, but not trashy looking. It's quite practical."
16644,1,Was very pleased with my purchase. Got it on time with no worries. Package was very good. Tracking was very easy and worrie free.
59783,0,"I saw a lot of reviews about how people remember a thicker Dr. Bronners product; you are right to recall that it used to be quite thick! I first used this 20 years ago, and recently bought a gallon off of Amazon because it was cheaper than a local store. When I received it, my first reaction was to have a fit. It wasn't thick like I remember, at all. I was pretty upset about that.Before I cried ""fake, watered down"", I went to the local store to see for myself what was going on. The Dr. Bronner gallons in the health food store were the same as the gallon of product I bought on Amazon. My suspicion is that the manufacturer has tinkered with their product. I don't want to say watered it down, who knows what they have done to it. But it's not the thick stuff of the old days, and if you remember the old days, it was a great product then.Having said that, it still works as part of my natural soft scrub recipe and that's what matters to me. I have much thicker castile soap products here that I bought at our health food store, but I paid almost twice as much for them as I did the Dr. Bronner product. (shrug)"
50788,0,"I am a black woman with natural hair (kinda kinky coily not soft loose curls by any means). I wear my hair straight, blown out and flat ironed. I attempted to use these rollers (after reading reviews stating it would not revert my hair, so yes I did read the reviews first) and the results were not good for me. These rollers gave me a few curls but all they really did was put too much moisture in my hair and leave me with a fluffy mess. I gave these three stars because they were packaged well, in perfect working order, and would probably work very well on someone else's hair.The rollers heated very quickly, you do have to get a rhythm going to get the shields on the rollers properly. The steam is not hot to the touch on the roller itself but you can feel the heat. The machine heats really quickly so you are ready to go almost as soon as you plug the machine in.As I stated earlier this is probably a great product for another woman but it reverted my hair and I had to send it back. I think I should go for a traditional hot roller system."
76167,1,"This bag is fabulous. I've been using it for a week now, I've yet to take it on a trip yet but I have high hopes. Im one of those girls who after getting ready to go out my makeup is all over my counter. This bag eliminates that problem! Also, no more rummaging in a huge bag unable to find what I need. I can see everything laid out or hang it up, it's fantastic! I love the loops too because I can stick my tweazers and brow scissors in there for easy access! Seriously this bag is fabulous! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I'm waiting till I take it flying next week."
210932,0,I like the scent on my husband. But it is very subtle and the scent does not last long on him.
24861,2,"This product was very dry, it seemed old and really did not work at all, I do not recommend, waste of money"
114533,2,"I purchased for my son, followed the directions very carefully and product did not work on his brown hair. We tried twice, leaving the product on longer and still no results. I contacted the company for a refund and were told that since the product was opened I could not return. Will never, ever purchase another product from this company. Extremely disappointed with the company and the product."
100583,1,I buy this all the time. I hope you guys have a sale one day!! (hint hint) My fav like i said i buy this all the time
251952,0,"I'm in week 4, and I still have the dreaded dimples. They are not as bad as they were, but defintely haven't said 'goodbye' yet. But, as long as you are using a lotion, you may as well use this for the minimal effects. Works better than a regular lotion. It smells great, spreads very well, and is quite affordable. My skin is extremely soft where I use it. I recommend this product because I am an especially difficult case; I have more than the little 'area' to tackle, so I didn't expect miracles. Definitely get the PATCHES, they work best for 'relief'. If you have to choose between patches and gel cream, go for the patches if you can afford it. It's a small price to pay for a little self assurance in those shorts and skirts."
100459,0,"The color wasn't what I expected, it was actually a dark purple. It doesn't glide on too easily either."
163766,0,"I have very curly hair. I was looking for a curling iron with tangle free, ceramic combs to replace the one I have which has been discontinued. I decided to try this product and was pleased with the results. It does hold the hair in place while drying so this eliminates blow drying then curling. The release button works great for tangle free. If there is anything I would like to change perhaps I would like for the temperature to get a little hotter. My hair is thick and course so I have to hold in position for a long time to dry and control the curl. But I would recommend this product to anyone looking for curl control as well as a styling tool. It is light weight and easy to handle. Good quality"
126429,1,"I have above-the-shoulder, color-treated hair. My quest is to remove as many chemicals from my beauty products as possible while still hiding the gray (yes, I know, chemicals). This shampoo and conditioner seem to fill the bill. The ingredients are listed in readable English and seem wonderful from a chemical-free stand point; it is not rated by EWG. The non-scientist in me wonders if more technical words were used would chemical processes materialize, but their website commentary warns about the dangers of certain chemicals so I assume they aren't used in their product. Mostly I love the way my hair feels from using this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is clean, non-greasy, not dry, and the color is staying true. I do feel it necessary to use the conditioner. It's more of a detangler - very light - but without it I'm not sure it'd be easy to comb out my hair. The initial mint smell is a little strong when applying, but I don't smell it after rinsing. I'm used to having more product in my hair for styling, but so far clean hair and a flat iron are doing the trick. I'm very happy. In response to comments about the coca betaine - their website says they re-formulated the shampoo and got rid of it. It is not listed on the current bottle ingredients."
43821,0,"I didn't care much for the Ahava Facial Cleansing Milk. The scent was a little overwhelming. Instead of making my face feel fresh and moisturized, it left my skin feeling greasy. My skin is sensitive and this product made me break out. This isn't a product that I would buy for myself."
119939,2,I have brunette hair so I didn't expect this to really change my hair color much but I at least hoped it would lighten it. No such luck. It only made my hair thick and sticky. It added sparkles but other than that it just didn't look right.
242106,1,"I bought the Pixi sheer cheek gel in natural and love it - the color does look natural, and you don't have to use very much to get a ""glow."" It lasts all day. I will definitely buy this again."
32979,0,"This product is used by my wife and it works well for her, she really likes it. My review is about the price and the time it takes to get it via mail. First of all, I received no Prime Member mailing option for it and had to pay for shipping. Secondly, I ordered multiple items like conditioner and fritz and they all required additional shipping. I received all of them in one package,except one that shipped from different vendor. In truth if you go to CVS or any local pharmacy you can buy them for $5 to $7. I paid about $11 or more and waited a week plus to receive them. This is not a bargain in Amazon. I hope this helps in saving a buck or two."
149980,0,"This is a good product but even for a travel size, I felt the amount of cream in the jar was very much on the low side."
63981,0,This is a great price for the product! I did some comparison shopping. The downside was that the bottle stayed in the hot sun before delivery.This altered the fragrance somewhat. Consider purchasing fragrances online in winter months so that heat is not a factor.
5974,2,The cologne is counterfeit! I have been a buyer of this brand (Hugo Boss) for 6 years and know what it smells like and how long it last. I went to my usual store to purchase and they were sold out so I decided to look for it on Amazon. After applying this cologne the smell was gone in 5 minutes! I notice the typeface print on the bottle is a little off from the normal bottle as well.Do not buy for this; this is not an authentic product be sold.
244412,2,"When the product arrived, the package was completely mangled. As I opened the package, one of the bottles of AHA was opened and some had squirted onto the packaging. The product itself does not seem to work. I do not get a ""stinging"" as described by other users of AHA when the lotion is applied, and it does not have a ""strange"" smell as other users had described. It just seems like plain lotion. It had no effect for me or my son. I am considering buying it again but from another dealer."
240302,0,"I wanted to use a self-tanner because I'm going on a trip and wanted to have a nice color. I liked the color, it only streaked a little, but after a day I put on white pants and it made my pants a little orange. I got a baby wipe and then proceeded to see if it came off it did. It wasn't bad, but I would not wear white with this product. I tried the Jergens brand and it was better, although it took a little longer to get the results I wanted."
110340,2,"I've never been nearly knocked out by a fragrance until smelling this one. It is SO strong, I couldn't even get it out of my olfactory sense after one small dab and then taking a shower to scrub it off. Patchoulli has always been one of my favorite scents, but this, well this is just overwhelmingly awful!"
243500,1,"Gotta love those Buf-Pufs. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, yet tough enough to exfoliate. I've been using them since I was a teenager but haven't been able to find them in a long while. Thank you for carrying them AMAZON!"
110095,0,"I like this perfume. Not typically attracted to very flowery or strong scents, I was looking for something a bit different and thought this might the answer. It is nice, but not a favorite.The good: it is musky, more mellow a scent. So, if you like that - this perfume might be for you. It is light and doesn't overpower, but still has a nice linger. It also does not smell like ""old lady perfume"" (per my sister). It has a more earthy quality that smells more natural than other store-perfumes (if that makes sense)To consider: if I were to give an untried smell description it would be: light notes of flower (like a cross b/w a lilac and daffodil - delicate but with substance), a somewhat soapy mid-tone, followed by a nice woodsy base note. For me, the slightly soapy smell - not bad, necessarily, but I just couldn't shake the association - made it fall into the 'nice but not favorite' category. Overall, I like it and wear it upon occasion (probably more in the summer) but not something I love enough to wear daily."
226548,1,"I love PS cologne. It's the best smell... not too sweet, not too rank.Most women complement me on it, and it only takes a little.Seems to last the whole day."
166135,0,This product did not work too much for me. You got what you paid for. This will probably work best for people who have normal skin. I have a very sensitive skin and I did not see the difference before and after.You can't beat the price though.
160439,0,"It is very watery, not a lot of substance unlike the Medium-hair version, which is a thicker shampoo and suds up better. Oh well, I still love their other products!!"
227968,0,The fragrance is great it just does not last long. After a few hours didn't smell it at all. Will not purchase again. Very disappointed because I bought this fragrance (actually I bought two) after reading the positive feed back.
170583,0,"I love the highlighter pink color of this polish, but it's a little runny, almost watery. I have to put a few coats on my big toe nails, not the normal 2."
84479,0,"I liked this conditioner, I just didn't love it. The texture is very different from any other conditioner that I have used. It did make my hair shiny and it did smell good, but I am just not sure it's for me. If you have dry hair, I wouldn't recommend this. It's a very lightweight conditioner that would benefit someone with oily hair. As a matter of fact, I actually ended up giving this to my teenage daughter, who does in fact have oily hair, and it seems to work just fine for her."
222077,0,I returned item. I am sure it worked well. Easy to return. It was too big for my length of hair. The bristles made it too big fo rme to use.
27683,1,"This is my first time using any BedHead products and so far, so good. It's got a strong scent, kind of reminds me of juicyfruit gum, but it smells good when my hair dries. I've gotten a few comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looks since I've been using this product, and I've found that my long hair is easier to comb."
87581,0,"I like the shine this gives my nails, but as far as hardening them I do not believe it works. It also peels over rather quickly, especially if you apply more than one coat."
78209,1,"This dye covered my gray the best out of all the other henna dyes I have tried. My hair is naturally black with strands of gray all over. The dye didn't turn the gray black it's more gold. The dye turned my gray strands gold, so it gives my hair some highlights."
190963,2,"This is a cute nail clipper, but it's flimsy--not up to Tweezerman's usual high quality. The hinge that holds the clipper in place fell out during the second time I used the clipper. I recommend Tweezerman's manicure scissors instead."
130091,1,"I bought this when my Chi stopped working. It is a great size and works really well. It glides through the hair very smoothly, unlike the Babyliss I tried. I recommend this over the Babyliss."
110032,0,"Due to a thyroid problem I have been losing my hair slowly for some time. I wanted a product thatcould help make a difference. I've been taking the product for about a month now and not noticingany difference. Under the product description, it would have been good for there to have been anindication that a pill needed to be taken more than once a day."
99133,1,"I've always had curly hair, since a child. I loved my curls when I was young, but now, I prefer my hair straight.. I discovered the &quot;B2V Straight Balm&quot; when I was getting my hair straightened. I was told by my stylist it would extend the &quot;straightened&quot; period. I used it every day and found that it kept my hair straight for TWICE as long as it would before! I no longer had to hold off washing my hair for days and I also noticed my hair looked shinier and healthier. This is a good product for those of us with &quot;Annie&quot; curls!"
63272,1,"I bought this product after researchin other similar eye creams and finding it highly recommended. I have been very pleased with its results, which have been better than more expensive creams. I don't think there is a product that can take all the wrinkles away,but this ones does a good job."
227096,0,"Wow. This is a very pretty color. A deep browned raisin color. I'm wearing it right now and a little sad because it didn't live up to its gorgeousness. I have about a dozen or so OPIs in my collection and this was the absolute, hands down, hardest to apply, easiest to dent, longest to dry and chipped and had edge wear in about two hours and that was with Seche Vite's top coat. It is a creme polish, no shimmer and has a very nice mirror finish with the top coat. I can actually see myself in it. That being said, it's a little on the thin side and did spill onto my cuticles on one nail. That could have been user error loading up the brush with too much polish, but the denting and the chipping definitely won't put it on my faves list. My mom is a nail tech and she's given me some great pointers, but even still this particular color was overall the hardest to apply.I have a near 100% DUPE of this. It's Revlon's Vixen. It's been a while since I've used that particular polish, so I can't vouch for the quality or ease of application (just that it costs A LOT less!). But, I was surprised at how identical they looked swatching them on white paper. Some other very close colors, with some being shimmers, are: China Glaze Loft-Y Ambitions & Branding Iron and Revlon's Autumn Berry (which is a touch more purple with shimmer)."
131212,1,"I have been searching for a moisturizer to help with my dry skin, especially around my eyes. I have tried everything, including the most expensive and recommended creams. I tried the Fresh Radiance Anti-Aging Day Cream and immediately felt the results. It wasn't heavy yet made my skin silky soft. It is better than most creams I have tried. Most creams today are oil free and they just dry me out. Yet, I have acne problems and am using a benzac wash daily. This moisturizer doesn't even break me out and provides the moisture I need. I combined this with the PreVentin-AT eye serum (the CVS lower cost option to those extremely expensive Acetyl Hexapeptide-3 Botox creams), and they work very well together. I haven't tried the Dove anti-aging eye cream, but I'm sure it is great also. My fine lines were reduced after the first day."
164856,0,"We have mixed feelings about this iron and did not purchase our unit from Amazon. My wife used this for many years and said she liked it best of all the curling irons she's had.On this one morning, she had it heating up while in an adjacent room. We smelled a synthetic burned odor. She discovered the curling iron overheated and the plastic tip was disfigured as it had melted off, leaving just the screw that holds that plastic tip in place intact.Fortunately she had not been been curling her hair when this overheating occurred.Since it appeared beyond saving, I disassembled it to find the reason for the failure. The electrical and mechanical construction show it is well designed. The electronics and switches did not show signs of overheating nor reveal sparks from electrical shorting. So the deduction is that the heating element which is not accessible, must have failed.Today is December 31st and the day after I wrote the above review. My wife decided she liked the curling iron a lot and got another one by the same manufacturer. It's identical in design but is the midi 5/8 inch size. It comes with a one-year warranty. I'll post any follow-up that is pertinent to overheating issues."
52758,0,I have only tried this once and it just drenches my hair!!! I shook it up and tried spraying far away. Even tried walking into it. It just soaks my hair!! I dont understand how this is supposed to work when i look like a crunchy mop afterwards and have to start over. it smells nice though and its more of a spray and brush through kind of spray.
138586,1,I have been using this stuff for over 10 years and when I found out that they were no longer selling it in stores I freaked... And go figure found it n amazon lol this stuff smells amazing gives your hair amazing shine and body without weighing it down... I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!!
12382,2,"This product DOES contain salicylic acid, for those that are sensitive to it, like me. It always clogs my pores and makes my skin break out, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do, I know. Read the ingredients and you will see it listed there."
40540,0,"I have tried lots of concealers, and I am still on the lookout for the perfect one. This one, however, is better than most I have tried. A little goes a long way, and it's easy to use too much. It does work wonders if you have a little imperfection, all it takes is a little dab and it covers it well. It lasts a very long time, I have had my tube for quite a while."
86707,0,I tried this product to curtail my nail biting. It worked great for a few weeks. Eventually I just got used to the taste and starting biting my nails regardless. At that point I just stopped using it.Don't try eating finger foods either... It ruins them.
30944,1,I got exactly what I ordered. It arrived in perfect condition & very quickly (DFW Tx address). This is a great leave in condition for people with dry curly hair. It won't take the curl out of your hair it leaves it soft & shiny & reduces the frizzies.
178281,0,"Great moisturizer, but caused me to break out. had to stop using it. I think that Neutrogena is a better product."
57775,0,This is a good moisturizer for the price - it does soften and amooth.As for erasing any wrinkles - as my headline says time does bring wrinkles and while moisturizers soften that's about it.
208691,2,"Could barely smell anything. Was watered down and the smell seemed off, not burberry. Just smelled liked chemicals that were watered down. What a waste of money cant ever return it. I have bought a couple of perfumes from Amazon before with no problem. This was just horrible, went in the trash can."
162296,0,"There are so many different Olay products in their Regenerist line, that it makes it confusing to be able to narrow it down. I guess the only way is trial-and-error. For this particular product (despite 5 star reviews from many customers), it didn't perform in a way that will persuade me to purchase again.Pros:- Thick cream (a little goes a long way)- Smells nice- Fast absorbingCons:- does not perform as advertised (firming aspect, but not that my age demographic of 30-35 needs it)- after 2 months of use, have not noticed any improvement in fine lines with sole use of this product (I am starting to develop my first fine line just under the eye area)What actually has worked in the past was the Neutrogena night cream with Retinol--but I don't like to use that every day because I don't want to become too dependent on Retinol.I actually really like the Olay Night Cream (for some reason, has a pale lavendar color). That must be a new product, because they're selling it as a free trial product shrinkwrapped to the Regenerist daily serum and Regenerist eye serum packages in stores."
191629,0,"I'm very much so a satisified user of the Axe sprays, but this one I find mediocre at best. It smells like a pina colada, which although is a good smell, I don't it appropriate as a body spray smell."
13601,0,"i bought the product after seeing a friend with an amazing tan. I ordered it because it said the product was a lotion. I have an ""oil"" phobia, so lotion is the way to go for me.I shhok the product really well, as the directions say, I can even stand the coffee aroma it emanates, but it is almost totally slimy from ""light"" mineral oil!. I could not stand it on my skin long enough to see if I tanned as well as my friend.If you don't mind oil, you won't mind this product!"
231963,2,"I got a horrible reaction to this cream. My face got terribly scarred and I am still recovering from it. I have used these products before,but for some reason this time I did not get a peel only painful blemishes a burning rash and large bright red and brown dried scabs.Just a very bad reaction!"
174831,2,"The product I received seemed like it might be old product or expired. The scent didn't stay with me, as compared to other samples I've had of ""Happy"" in the past; in fact, it couldn't be smelled at all after half an hour. I contacted the seller about it who said he would return it for a full refund including the cost of my postage. Hopefully, he will be true to his word."
76035,2,I bought this product because of all the good reviews. This was not the fragrance I expected. I did not think this was lovely.
61751,2,"I don't think it is the original eau de toilette. I have been using this product for a long time and I can see the difference. I use it every day and in the past people used to ask me all the time what perfume I was wearing. Now, I can not smell it and it doesn't stay in my body."
63120,0,It does not cover large pores as I expectedand it is expensive for the little results I got from using it. It does go on very smoothly and I like the sunscreen aspect.
1671,0,"Product is not bad. It has reinforced ribbing along the seams, which of course strengthens it a bit. But for $5+ it's too pricey. I had expected a thicker plastic and it is thoroughly see-thru. But for travel, especially for airport security, it's perfect and functional. I can't say I would buy this again. I'm sure I could find one elsewhere for lesser price."
125156,2,"I have had this curling iron for about 6 months and used it rather infrequently (bh100 bed head tigi). When i went to use it yesterday, it had malfunctioned and heated up SO hot that it instantly burnt my hair right off. It melted some to the iron itself and the rest just fell out! I have never had anything like this happen, and usually love all the bedhead products, I am so very disappointed and had to cut approx. 2 inches of the length of my hair to even the chunk burnt out...so sad!!!! USE THIS PRODUCT CAUTIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
97746,0,"This is a pretty good nail brush. The bristles are a bit on the soft side, for my taste, but all-in-all it's an OK nail-scrubber. The bristles on the side intended for &#34;nail cleaning&#34; are a bit hard to use, but the brush is a lot better than the ones with wood handles (which sog out and decompose in short order). The price is really good."
168814,0,"These pills really did help my hair grow about an inch in one month, but you have to take SO many pills to see dramatic results! I seriously would sometimes gag by how many pills I had to down. I'm taking Viviscal now which works (although not as fast), but you only have to take 2 pills."
102701,0,"I purchased a 3-piece set of Demeter's fragrance which contained, Fresh Ginger, Ginseng Root, and Green Tea. Green Tea was the worst of the 3 scents, because something in it gave me a terrible headache: Trashed it. Ginseng Root has a somewhat musty, incense? smell to it: Not too bad, but I am not sure about this one. Fresh Ginger is the best of the 3 scents. Fresh Ginger has an earthy, woody, and somewhat mysterious note to it and it does NOT give me a headache....in fact, as I write this comment, I sprayed Fresh Ginger on my wrist, and LOVE the scent. It is one of the best fragrances that I have tried; however, I am not sure that it is going to be my signature scent, because whenever I wear it away from home, most people sniff at me, and noone asks me about the fragrance; so, I guess (some?) they don't particularly care for it. I think that I will try Fresh Laundry or Pure Soap next, because many people seem to give very good reviews about these fragrances: particularly Fresh Laundry.I am trying to find THEEE fragrance (or two), but I am somewhat cautious about many fragrances, because they usually give me a headache. Strangely, I thought that musk was the culprit, but I am not certain about this as I have white musk (albeit an old bottle of about 10 years which may have weakened the scent?) by The Body Shop and I tested it by spritzing on my wrist and smelled it multiple times to see what affect (if any) the musk would have towards my sinus area. Well, after a few hours of intermittent wrist-smelling, I finally had a headache. I alternatively, did this without smelling my wrist, and noticed that I had no headache. So, I guess spraying on the wrist, and probably not near the nose (neck, ears, hair) is my best bet, unless it is not just musk which gives me a headache."
157542,0,i have used it for almost two weeks and haven't seen much difference.. i'm still hoping in time it will be worth the price.
124896,0,"I was able to get this product for @ half off the retail price on Amazon, and for that price, I was quite satisfied (but would not have been if I'd paid full price.) It is a very good moisturizer (a little dab'll do ya; I used too much at first, and got a few pimples, which was not quite the ""youthful"" look I was hoping for!), but I haven't noticed any reduction in the appearance of my wrinkles or sun spots at this point (after @ 1 month of daily use.) I would NOT recommend this product for anyone with even mildly sensitive skin, however; I have skin that is generally about as sensitive as rhino hide, and it really stung and caused redness for @ 20 minutes or so the first time I used it (I actually felt burned), but then only a little bit the second application, and nothing since then."
133150,1,This is a product that lives up to its claims. I have used this for over one year and notice that it indeed stops breakage when used as directed. It also make your hair soft and manageable. I would highly recommend it!
179343,1,"As stated in previous reviews, the nail polish I received is a completely different color from the one pictured. It is a bright neon coral, rather than the pink that is pictured. Since it is a neon shade, it requires 3 thin coats for complete coverage and also requires a top coat for shine. Neon colors tend to chip faster as well, so this is certainly not the best option for long wearing nail color. I would suggest buying nail polish in store or looking up swatches on google before purchasing any nail polish online as this is not the first time I have received a color that did not look the same as the one pictured."
230669,0,It gets the bulk of the hair but I still have to finish the job with a hand held razor. Be careful when opening the package because it is sealed up like Fort Knox. When I cut the top off and pulled the plastic apart the Headblade flew out and fell in the sink causing the blade holder to break. Fortunately the package was supplied with an additional blade holder that works with most blades you get with disposable razors.

84238,1,"When my hair was long, I'd use conditioner to keep it tangle free. Now, I just like how my hair feels after I use it. Neutragena Triple Moisture conditioner makes my hair feel light and healthy and easier to comb through. It's thicker than most conditioners that come in a bottle. Maybe that's why this one comes in a tube. The sweet almond scent is sophisticated, not trendy, and I don't find it overpowering. I bought the 3-pack on Amazon and have not been disappointed."
158112,0,"I have had many of these in the past, and the most recent one I purchased had poorer quality. It does not get as hot, so it doesn't really seem to style my hair very well. They might have fixed the overheating problem, but they created a worse one. Back to the drawing board, Vidal Sassoon."
133762,2,"Normally, I would not spend $40+ for a fancy water/alcohol blend. But I had just run out of toner (from another brand), had some store credit I wanted to be rid of from Sephora, and all they had left was one 3.4 oz bottle of this product. I had heard good things about it though, and the rep that was helping me recommended it for its naturally-derived ingredients and simplicity. Along with the Beauty Elixir, the rep recommended the Vinopure Matte Finish Fluid, which I bought as well.The most important thing for me is using products with safe ingredients that wont aggravate my oily, acne-prone skin. So I've been leaning more towards natural and organic products, as they tend to have fewer controversial and/or proven harmful ingredients. Caudalie products hardly meet these standards, but it's better than a lot of the other brands that Sephora offers. Especially now that they have discontinued the Pangea Organics line, the only brand I still felt pretty comfortable using there. ):I immediately began using the Beauty Elixir along with the Vinopure Matte Finish Fluid twice a day. Unfortunately, within one or two weeks, I noticed that I was getting a lot of little whiteheads around my T-Zone. A few whiteheads on occasion are normal for me, but the extent to which I was breaking out at this point was unusual. I don't know whether it was the toner, the moisturizer, both, or something else that just happened to coincided with the time that I began to use these products. Maybe I just didn't use them long enough? But I didn't want to risk making it worse by experimenting to find out, so needless to say, I discontinued use immediately. Within a week my skin returned to normal. I'm pretty convinced that it was these Caudalie products that caused the breakout, but take from it what you will. They must be working for some others at least, just from looking at the reviews. Just be wary if you're acne-prone like me.What I DID like about the Beauty Elixer was the glass bottle and spray. It comes out in a very fine mist - just two sprays was enough for me. The cooling sensation (from the balm mint, I suppose) felt nice. However, my skin has always been sensitive to alcohol, so it'd sting for a few second around my eyes, nose, and other sensitive areas. It wasn't excruciating, but not pleasant either.I gave this product two stars for the nice packaging, spray, and some decent ingredients. Took three stars for the ridiculous price, use of alcohol plus a few other questionable ingredients, and for potentially making me break out. I'll be taking this, along with the moisturizer, back to Sephora and returning to the products I had been using before."
114220,0,"I tried twice according to the directions and it looked terrible both times. I agree with the other two reviews, the pink is way too opaque and light and on top of that ends up looking streaky. The third time I tried it I was almost out of guides so I just used the bottom coat then painted two coats of the pink on the tips and ended with the top coat. Best looking frenchie so far. Had I known I would have just chosen my own colors."
17010,1,"I do like this blush. It does not make you look like a cupie doll at the fair. You can build it to your desired effect. It looks more natural than all the blushes I have tried, has a very nice suttle effect on the cheeks,but also color. Blends very nice and has a lasting effect. I do recommend it."
63402,0,If you live in a climate that is hot and/or humid you will need to stick your face in the aircondition for 15 minutes to be able to get this mask dry and off your face. It cannot be wiped while wet because it is very sticky. I also do not agree with the alcohols that are part of the ingredience list. Everybody knows that alcohol is absolute NO for the skin...but my face did look better after applying this mask and once I got it dry it peeled off nicely.
201679,0,"I was really concerned when I first tried to pump the gel out and it wouldn't come after a full minute of pumping. I opened up the top and saw that the inside was a thick gel rather than a liquid like I expected. I could understand why it wasn't pumping out!Finally, I got some out. It came out as a gel rather than a liquid but I was able to blend it. It took a 2-3 applications to get the desired color (this is for ""Cheeky Cherry;"" I have a light complexion with freckles). So I think/hope this will work well enough despite my initial doubt when it wouldn't pump."
122603,0,"I like them okay, but with my hair in a ponytail the comb part near my ears just sat there.... and then my black one broke, which makes me sad because I only had it like 3 days, but they were super cheap..... oh well"
35680,1,"I used to love other Salvador Dali perfume when I was living in much colder climate. I bought this perfume based on reviews stating that the scent is fresh and clean. I guess, tastes are different. My opinion is that this scent is very alluring and exotic, but too intense for the warm climate. At least it's true in my case. It will be ideal for people who love strong sweet/spicy fragrances."
71074,0,"I was previously familiar with the Spray on Hair Color product because of being able to purchase it through my local Walgreens. They stopped carrying it and I had searched repeatedly to no avail. I simply forgot about the internet. I was very glad to find and purchase 4 aeresol cans of this prodcut. However, you have to be very careful with it. You must apply in very short bursts or a powdery film will be prevalent throughout the entire bathroom after just one use. It goes on well and is easy to apply however it rubs off on anything and everything. Don't get caught in the rain as it is water soluable and little droplets will run down your cheeks and neck, It will stain the neck portion of a dress shirt and is difficult to launder the stain out. Even with all of this I still find it the best value for the money out there and I have tried many products. Use a towel around your shoulders much the same way a barber would when applying after getting dressed. It also leaves a stain on pillow cases. I find it better to shower and remove the hair color from my scalp before going to bed."
47200,0,"There's nothing terribly wrong with this night cream. It moisturizers and keeps my skin soft, but that's all. I was hoping for something a little more radiant or more. This is by no means a &#34;night recovery&#34;."
103429,0,"This is a very expensive alternative for the same effectiveness and the same smell as using an alcohol swab to clean the skin. What's worse is that the pad leaks so much liquid that you have to be very careful not to hold the bottle horizontal or upside down or there will be way too much liquid released. Overall, I felt this was a waste of money."
36307,0,"I thought this would make my hair appear smoother and less dry, which it really didn't, but it did give me a little bit of shine and prepared it for flat-ironing. It also has a nice minty-chocolate smell."
236968,0,"This was going great for me at first... But then after a few days, I noticed a NEW pimple on my face.. this was a pimple that isn't even in my T-zone, where I get the most of my pimples. Plus, this drying lotion cannot get rid of all your pimples. In fact, blemishes are still visible after using this. So I say, trying something else first."
232594,0,"I bought this after reading the good reviews and I was also looking for something to help maintain a keratin treatment (bkt). I've used this Reconstructor 4-5x now and it really hasn't proven to be conditioning for my thick, wavy (and a lot) of hair. I've used more conditioner each subsequent time just to make sure I was using enough, but the results are the same.I'm not thrilled about this product, but will keep it and use it up (as shipping it back will make this cost that much more in the end!)"
83447,1,"These are nice, high quality tweezers. They're very easy to grip, very easy to use and I like them a lot more than traditional tweezers."
199589,1,I absolutely love this scent. Its not over powering yet it lasts. It is a lot like Cool Waters. I think it reacts differently to everyones body chemistry. For me it is wonderful and my boyfriend thinks so too. I suggest you try a small sample bottle first and then go for a bigger one if it passes the test.
162644,1,I bought this for my boyfriend as he wears this and it makes him smell so good. He will have some for a year or more
145358,2,"I purchased a 6oz tube from Amazon back in December. I started using using Strivectin on Dec. 6th. I have not seen any difference in my forehead wrinkles or around my eyes. As a matter of fact I think I'm starting to develope a new forehead wrinkle. So, it doesn't prevent wrinkles from developing, either. After reading all the reviews, I have to wonder if I received a counterfiet tube of Strivectin. Whatever I got, it doesn't work and I won't be purchasing any other miracle products. I guess I'll just age naturally..."
228405,0,"So 3 stars, one for delivery, one for well-packed package and one for the smell.The delivery was super quick, the item arrived within 2 days. I think that's a new record for my experience with Amazon. The package was packed very well, HOWEVER, the perfume box itself is very battered and the bottle appeared to have been used. I've bought Hugo at department stores a couple of times but the box or bottle had never looked like the one I just received. This purchase was meant to be a gift, but considering the condition I am now embarrassed to give it away. Amazon has always been my go-to store but this time...what a disappointment!"
126209,0,"This shaving cream worked well, but really isn't anything better than the cheaper products you can by at walmart. It smells good as well, but the product overall really isn't very memorable."

Kudos to Amazon.com for not only notifying me, but refunding ALL of my money. They work ok, but definitely are not a Chi product. However, I got to keep them and they are better than my normal 15.00 flat irons;-)"
99503,2,"Not sure if it is because we have hard water or what, but this stuff feels like I am just putting sticky waxy stuff on top of the dirt. My hair was so gummy I couldn't even brush though it and I washed it out thoroughly. In fact, I got back in the shower and rinsed it out again thinking I left some in, but it was the same after rinsing it again. It took a few washings with another shampoo to get it out. It leaves skin feeling sticky and itchy too."
22063,2,"I purchased this almost a year ago to take with me on my trip to Europe.It looks fine, and wouldn't mind packing it into my suitcase. I didn't think that it was abnormally big.What the problem was, and the only reason for giving it just two stars, is that the dryer has two small tubes(?), almost looks as though it's purely for design, that run along the barrel of the dryer. These make it so that the width of the barrel is too wide to accomodate a universal diffuser. I have curly hair and, without being able to find a diffuser to use with this dryer, I can not use the dryer. It is still sitting in my closet, completely unused for a year. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay, as I'd already thrown out the packaging when I received the dryer.If you're not planning on using a diffuser with it, it looks great and seems as though it would work wonderfully!"

201518,1,"I love this lotion. I got it for the first time in Hawaii. It sinks in, leaves no greasy feel. Your skin drinks it in and loves it. Better love the smell of coconut though..."
184145,0,I purchased China Glaze Pool Party & Yellow Polka Dot BikiniThe Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon yellow.I noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color going.The colors are so pretty but you just need so many coats.I used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.I really like China Glaze but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle but like I have said just need too many coats.The polishes also chipped within a day as well.
42768,2,"I fell into the hype and ordered a bar, after a few showers I threw it away. It made no difference in my skin, rather than smelling like rotten eggs. The soap actually dries you out a bit. I would only recommend this if your dermatologist says you need it. Otherwise dont fall into the hype."
194770,1,"The color of this polish is awesome - a great spring/summer color. My one issue with it (and a lot of China Glaze polishes) is that it's a bit hard to get on - they could benefit from a brush re-design. Also, because of the light color it took me about a billion coats (okay, like four) for it to be fully opaque.The color is very nice, though."
123018,0,"I've been coloring my hair with straight up body art quality henna and indigo for years now. I'm sick of the smell and the grit and how difficult it is to wash out. I also found it difficult to always get the right mix for what I was trying to achieve. I wanted to try something different, but I love the translucent, natural looking quality of henna and didn't want to go with the usual chemical mixes. I did some research and came up with this.I chose Golden Brown. My hair is a medium to dark brown, but I have some stand out grays, and this product did exactly what I wanted it to: it gave most of my hair a sheen and colored the grays a golden blonde color, which makes them look like natural highlights. Surya was also easy to apply and smelled great compared to straight henna. Easy to rinse out. I couldn't be more pleased. Even if I have to use it more often than regular henna, it's much less hassle and I think the grays will be less obvious as they grow in anyway.Edited to add:Well, I gave up on the Surya. Everything I wrote was true, except that the color faded with stunning speed. I switched to darker colors to compensate, and they didn't really last longer. It also bled, which stands to reason. I switched back to body art quality henna and indigo. Lesson learned."
124408,1,"I was using the NO POO for weeks when my hair started to feel ""gunky""....My scalp felt coated with sebumand I didn't feel that NO POO was getting my scalp clean enough...Eventually, my hair started feeling likeI was putting hand lotion on it, instead of shampoo.Deva Curl is a whole protocol that is enhanced by using their conditioner and styling products for the full effect of getting perfect curls. I had a Deva Curl haircut...but the curls were starting to look weird and frizzed out.I started hating the haircut but my stylist told me to switch to LOW POO for awhile...and only use NO POOonce a week..As soon as I switched to LOW POO, I loved my haircut again..I got a cleaner scalp and cleaner hair and more curls and bounce and better shine.I think the NO POO built up on my scalp and weighed down my hair and made the condtioner and styling gel too sticky..LOW POO is the perfect rotation shampoo for people who use NO POO, even for a few days in a row to wash out all product build up.Today is a rainy day. I used LOW POO this morning....No frizz and my curls are beautiful."
15516,2,"My hubby put this on and it smelled like womens cologne. He gave it to our son, he says it smelled so much like women's perfume he was afraid to wear it around his girlfriend. Bad buy. Smells weak. But I do recommend Chrome Sport."
154322,0,"I have been using patchouli based products and perfume for years, it's one of my favourite scents. I like the smell of the product, but I found it VERY runny coming out of the pump, almost like water. Now, I may have just gotten a bad container, but this was my experience."
23443,0,"My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)I loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached. It scared me because it happened while straightening my hair. I decided to try the Sedu because I thought it would last longer and I was really curious if it were better.SOLIA PROS- Swivel cord never got tangled, I have to battle the Sedu every use- It got hotter- My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu I have to keep straightening though the day.- It was easier for me to maneuver- The plates touch, with the Sedu there is a slight gapSEDU PROS- It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min. more- Easier to clean, Sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution- Lighter- Doesn't pull my hair, my hair did get caught in the Solia once in a whileBoth of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me. I'm going to go ahead and buy another Solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old. I wouldn't mind it so much if I didn't have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day). If I don't have time to keep straightening, I have to keep rubber bands in my purse to put my hair up. That's a big problem for me.What I learned...IF IT'S NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT."

58967,0,"The soap seems ok, smells good, works ok. But it is is very thin, very watery. It's not just a little bit thinner than normal liquid soap, but very much thinner. The label lists water as the primary ingredient. Be super careful if you use a pump bottle for this soap, it shoots out with lots of velocity unless you are very careful.Paid good money to ship water across country. I wish they would let me add water after it arrived!"
176545,0,"This fragrance smells very similar to Victoria Secret's ""Very Sexy"", which I am not a fan of. What's more, the aroma doesn't last very long at all. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either."
121699,1,"If your kid has hair that tangles easy like ours, this stuff is an answer to prayer. Our 3 yr old has beautiful curly hair and it tangles into a rats nest if you don't brush it out twice a day. We went to a high end salon to get my wife's hair done and had our daughter get a little taste of being pampered. The stylist used this on her and it was like MAGIC how it got the tangles out and kept them out. We were using handfuls of other conditioner with her before, but just a little of this goes a long way and works wonders. It is a little pricey but pays for itself when you compare how much of the cheaper stuff you have to use and the time you save brushing out tangles. We love it. I hope it works as well for you as it does for us."
58720,2,I purchased this product at Macy's Dept. Store because it claimed to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark circles. This product does not work. I used it morning and night with no results.
40631,0,"This was a wrong choice on my part, as the Customer Service Rep told me it was more ""clarifying"". I wanted something to use on occasion between Wen which is a great product but at times i wanted to use a ""regular"" shampoo in between to save money - but the difference in the way my hair felt was awful. It makes me sure that i want to use only the Wen and pay the price - but if you need a product for oily hair this one would be good - Just not for my fine, color treated hair - So i will use it as a bubbly bath - The scent is pleasant any way"
174518,0,"Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is the best lip shimmer on the market. I don't particularly like the Papaya color, but the it is still scrumptious. I like that it provides coverage for those dry winter lips and yet provides enough color to your lips unlike other lip balms. The only funny thing about the shipment I received was the size of the box. There were three of these small tubes in this huge box. They could have sent them in a padded envelope."
4089,0,I bought this because of other reviews. Because I am a woman with very thin hair I thought I could use it in my hairline for better application. NO! It looks terrible and makes the hair fibre stand out. Waste of money for me. My hairline is thin and my hair is long.
152373,1,I have used this product for many years and can say i love it. Not too strong...just right. I wear it everyday.
147258,2,hated this! washes off a day later and still gives u that orangy look EVERYWHERE! never buy again.. if u r interested in this u either have a base tan and it works for u or u either love being orange.. very upset with this product.. i rather go tanning and get brown then turn out looking like an orange freak
172472,0,"Recently I've developed sensitivity to ammonia-containing permanent haircolor, so when my roots started showing, I searched high and low and found this brand of a plant-based colorant. My hair is naturally dark brown but I had it lightened to about light brown over the summer. I wanted to get it back to natural, so I bought shade 4N ""Natural Chestnut"". The directions are straight-forward and other than a few grammatical errors, it was not too bad for a foreign company (Naturtint is based out of Spain). I followed the instructions precisely: application was not too bad, it is a little more liquid than other hair color brands I had used, but it doesn't drip much. It will stain your skin if you don't wipe it off right away. After waiting for 30 minutes (normal time, I don't know where one of the reviewers got ""20 minutes""), I rinsed it off. I was a bit concerned about the amount of dye that was rinsing out of my hair right away. I mean, after 2 shampoos and conditioning, the water was still running black. I should not have been concerned though - when I looked in the mirror, my hair was BLACK. Not medium brown (which I wanted), not even dark brown (which I could have lived with), no, it was very dark black. At this rate, I think that I would have to go with the dark blonde shade to get the medium brown that I wanted. It did leave my hair shiny and less damaged than the ammonia-based dye and my sensitive scalp was less itchy. But if you want to try using this color, I would recommend buying a color 2 shades lighter than your intended shade to achieve the desired result. I think I will wait 2 weeks (avoiding the mirror and fencing off ""Why in the world is your hair black?"" comments) and then try the dark blonde shade unless the haircolor lightens with daily washing. I am actually looking forward to the fading on this one and hope that some of the reviewers were right when they said it faded quickly."
32938,2,I can't believe how those people possibly gave 4 or 5 stars on this product. I ordered it because 77 people gave good reviews. Please don't buy it. It's really nothing more than packing tape except for the color. I strongly agree with TruthSeeker's review.She mentioned exactly what I wanted to say.
58077,1,"My husband really likes to drink goats milk - and he loves Ivory soap.. so I bought this soap for him. Goat's Milk Soap, imagine that. Wow! It does have a faint fragrance of Ivory, and is very soothing to skin. In fact, I like it too, and I'm glad I got more than just one bar! It seems long lasting, but when we run out, we'll get more."
142874,0,"I love this color. It's a beautiful cross between pink, purple and brown. The lip gloss isn't long wearing meaning you have to reapply every hour or 2. Also, the tube leaks. You will have to constantly wipe off the screw top - if you don't your purse will be covered in lip gloss. As much as I love this color, it's expensive, it makes a mess and isn't long wearing. I made the switch to Smashbox Limitless lipgloss in the color ""endless"". The lip gloss is long wearing, doesn't make a less and is the same price as the NARS."
144905,2,"To be very honest, I would have no idea if the product its self is a good product or not, because the selling description with it, was not made clear enough for a man shopping for a woman, this item is not complete, and needs an additional product in order to be used. Enlarge of the presented photo also did nothing towards making that clear for the consumer. Bascially my family member, has an item that can't be used unless or untill we can find the other part needed to complete use of this item. My advise is, and suggestion, is to be able to ask a question of the seller of the item's for more complete information. Just my honest opinion."

I must admit that the product did get quite warm when it was sent to me and even leaked from the jar.

213554,2,"I was very disappointed in this product and do not even use it. A few years back I had purchased a Conair Hot Air brush that was remarkable but this is nothing like it at all.

217500,2,"Really, curling irons are not newfangled inventions - they've been around for centuries. So to put one on the market with such a wretched design is truly irresponsible. Both the on-off switch and the temperature setting are right where you grab the thing to use it, which means that by using it you constantly bump the temperature off setting or turn it off inadvertently. The temperature wheel is so loose - and not a click wheel - that it is impossible to set a temperature and insure that it stays there, which can lead to serious burns on the skin or hair. What a craptastic demonstration of shoddy design and manufacturing straight from China. Will be returning mine forthwith."
5277,2,I have been a customer of this product for several years. This is first time I bought off amazon. I get the same color every time. This color was off..it was not the same that I bought in the store..it is darker..which gave me an orange tint. Not sure why...unless this is where they sell not to par products. Other than that Bare Essentials is a great product. BUY IT...but maybe you should buy it at a local store.

I did try it knowing full well this was not going to work. I was right. My hair looked 10 times bigger then it normally is. The steam made my hair so puffy and frizzy it was comical. Stay away if you have naturally curly hair. Steam and curls are not a good combo. My hair looked like I sat in a sauna all day-YIKES!"

Just every now and then the skin on my legs feels a little dry and itchy. I was hoping this would be my remedy. Not so. First of all, this product does not have a very pleasent smell. It smells very chemical. Second of all, this product provides little to no moisture or relief to the skin. My skin felt moisturized and less itchy for maybe 2 minutes? I would buy a bottle of St. Ive's or SEACRET any day over this."

The brush cracked in two places the very first time it was used.Probably the poorest quality item I have ever purchased. A complete waste of seven dollars (not worth the effort of trying to get a refund).I have other Earth Therapeutics items that I love. The concept of this brush is fine, but the implementation is lousy. WHAT A SHAME"

46865,0,"In the extreme sense of the words ""oil free"" it'll certainly do that. It'll take the oils off your hands in the shower when you wash with it. Now, my skin needs are not so extreme that I need this level of drying it out, but I can see where some might. It does as promised, though it just wasn't right for me, it'll dry out the skin. If you have combination skin like I do or seasonal (during the summer) excess oily, this isn't the product for you. This is something one with serious oil issues uses."
91072,0,it seems to dry out your skin more than I expected. I had to quit using it before I could even tell if it works. I live in Colorado so it's rather dry here anyway. I bet it works better in more humid places.

151560,0,"I got these about 3 weeks ago. Based on the reviews I wasn't sure I would like them, but I was really hoping I would since I love the retracting cord feature. I currently have 2 good sets of curlers I use, but they are small. I was hoping to find set I could use for my entire head. These costs more than both my two other sets combined and they don't work as well. I'm returning them.My hair is fine and naturally wavy. I curl it to give it more definition. It takes a curl pretty well, and with my other set the curl just relaxes throughout the day and looks very nice. With these the curlers it fell out within a few hours. It was never as defined as my other sets. They just didn't seem hot enough, even with 12 settings.I liked the clips. They were fine and I prefer them to the wire ones. I like everything about the product EXCEPT how it works on my hair."

117461,2,"Paul Mitchell Gloss Drops give an extra shine boost to your hair and they smell great, but there's a big problem with this product. Gloss Drops weighs down fine hair with a greasy coating and ruins a potentially good look. Even without fine hair, any more than 1 - 2 drops of this product can weigh your hair and make it extremely oily even if you have naturally dry hair. With Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Oil (another Paul Mitchell product) on the market, Gloss Drops isn't really worth your time, unless you have extremely thick long or coarse hair."

I wouldn't have bought the product had I known this.The product itself works OK. No huge noticeable difference like what other reviews posted. I am wondering if this is because it is older and not as fresh."
22462,0,NOt hte best for color match... pretty if you add a pearlized topcoat to it... Does not last if you don't have a top coat... Easily chips ( when topcoat is not present) Resembles paint... SHAY is better than the Minka
65679,0,"Honestly, this is a bit pricey for lip liner. It doesn't last any longer than any other lip liner I've purchased. After I purchased it, I had buyer's remorse especially finding that it's not any better than some cheaper liners I've purchased. In my opinion, save your money. I certainly will not purchase it again."
175341,1,Love this product! All natural. Full of healthy skin softening ingredence. The polypeptides realy work. I never break out unlike other moisterizers I've tried. Want to look 10 years younger. Try it.
146770,1,"This product is amazing! It's so gentle, but so effective. Takes eye makeup (including mascara) right off, without having to tug harshly at the delicate skin around your eyes. I absolutely love it. I would definitely recommend and repurchase this item. Looks as though it will last me a long time, too. A little goes a long way."
167107,0,"Bought to address constant facial redness for my son, and I also tried it as well to soften my ruddy complexion. It is moderately effective but it has some negatives that you have to consider:1. It is heavy and thick and not easily absorbed so you must massage it in well or you will have an obvious green tint.2, Since it is green if you are not careful you can get it into hairlines and eyebrows where it is difficult to remove and then you have green lotion obvious.One positive is that it does provide sunscreen and that seems effective with limited use."

165700,1,"My skin was very bad during my entire first pregnancy, and this product saved my life! It's very mild, and always left my face fresh and feeling great. Love the cooling effect!! All natural - what's not to love?"
62116,1,"I have been looking all over the place for something to repair the damage inflicted upon my golden tresses by the evils of a particular ""Blow Dry Perfector"" (HA! What a joke...). I can not reveal the culprit, but it comes in a green box and is the worst thing I have done to my hair in YEARS. My hair felt like straw when I was done and was breaking off in pieces. After trying several unsuccessful conditioning treatments, this stuff actually worked decently well! I wish these came in larger size bottles, as I had to buy another after less than two weeks. Of course, there is no such thing as a miracle repair cream for severely damaged hair, but I could at least run my fingers through my hair after the first use and after a week of consistent use, there is a noticeable difference in my hair's texture. It's becoming soft again and there is a lot less breakage. In fact, my co-worker even commented the other day how soft and shiney my hair looked. Muahaha! little did she know that my secret is SHEEP PLACENTA!Yes, there's animal placenta extract in it. It doesn't smell bad and the texture is not goopy, as one might expect. It's actually quite watery. When you think about it, it's probably not as weird as some of the other chemicals and dyes we slather on our hair on a semi-regular basis. At least this product is up-front about it's ingredients...unlike a particular ""Blow Dry Perfector"". Yes, I'm still bitter.Directions: Shampoo hair. Spray in Hask Placenta and let sit for 3 minutes. Style as normal."
84068,0,"This didn't work well for me, it was too thick and didn't apply well with my hair so I didn't really use it."
161149,0,"The compactness of this dryer is great for travel. The only fault I have is that the high speed is not what I would call ""high"". It is more like a medium speed. If you have long hair, as I do, it takes forever to get it dry."
24347,0,"I thought it would be a little bigger. Wanted it for both mine and my husband's toiletries. Doesn't hold everything, such as his electric razor."
62046,0,"I love the color of this product; plus it left my hair texture as normal as my own hair, which is great since I was concerned it would damage my hair like other hair color products. The only problem is the color only lasted three weeks -- and I use color-safe shampoo and only wash every other day. So, that's very disappointing....Otherwise great product!"
114147,2,I ordered this for my wife. I knew is was only 4 oz but it seemed even smaller. For the price it is not worth it. My wife liked the smell but the results were horrible. Would never purshase this again.
140410,1,"My husband bought me this for Valentine's and it's great! The lavender scented wax is wonderful and soothing to the muscles as well as the mind. I'm not bothered about not having a timer or a temp. adjustment (if it gets too hot for you, unplug it!). The whole contradicting model number thing is a bit puzzling, though...you get the 200 model with all the 500's accessories (booties, extra liners, brush, terry wrap). However; Amazon.com's website and the box the unit came in show exactly what you get, so I was not surprised. All in all, a great product at a great price."
85573,0,"What they don't tell you about this product is that it smells HORRENDOUS. The smell is like that of rodent urine with a hint of mint. It's most especially noticeable if you use it on and around your nose. Thankfully, most of it goes away after about half an hour. Though I'm not sure if it actually went away or I just got used to the smell...As far as how well it works, that's the only thing keeping this review at 3 stars. Works exceptionally well."
216766,1,Bought this for my husband for fathers day. I recieved it quickly and in the origional box. Great for the price and the scent is amazing. Love it!
161480,2,"Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord. It broke within the first week. For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor. It broke right away. Although it is OK, it is not one that I would have selected just as a hairdryer."
150592,0,I like all the Burberry perfumes but this one. I just couldn't wear it..to strong for me. It's still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I'll keep it there. I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle. Beware of those magazine samples...that's happened to me before.
111750,0,"My first one survived about 10 months, with occasional use.My second one just died ten minutes ago, and I've probably used it ten times, maximum. I'm so unhappy that I had to log in and report my experience.HAIR TYPE: My hair is long, fine, wavy and I have a lot of it. I usually let it air dry, so it is very healthy.PRO's:- This is a decent dryer that makes it easier to straighten, de-frizz on days when my wavy hair isn't working for me. I can't hack the hair dryer and separate round brush combo, so this is a decent substitute.- It's not silent, but certainly not deafening as some hair dryers I've heard.CON's:- The buttons are located right where you put your hands, so it's always changing settings, including the ionic feature being accidentally switched off.- The fan holes at the base of the unit can catch and pull out strands of your hair, twisting and burning them. Ouch and Ew, what a smell.- You can get burned by the barrel very easily.- IT DIES. KICKS THE BUCKET. GONE BABY GONE.I'd liked my first one well enough, and was bummed when it went to Hairdryer Heaven. So I picked up a second one and, well, guess this one's going in the trash as soon as the barrel cools. RIP, old friends.Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, I'm buying another brand!"
161081,1,"I absolutely love my andis hair Straightener. It has beenheaven to my hair, never have I had a Straightener that works so well especially with my hair type"
111302,0,This polish came in a bottle without a brush. How are you supposed to apply it without a brush? It should be clear in the description that no brush is included.
175442,0,"Works just fine. I wish I had ordered a ""cord-keeper"" blow dryer, but that's my fault.In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver. At least mine was."
217084,0,"This is quite a pretty nail polish. I got mine from Cassiecosmetics and the polish had been diluted so it's not showing its true colours but if you can get hold of a genuine one, it should be quite a good nail polish"
197729,2,"I love, love, LOVED my Chi hair straightener; then it just stopped working. It always worked wonders on my hair, but it wasn't worth the $100+ for only two months. If you buy it online, the warranty is void. Wish someone had told me that. Save some cash and do a little more research on other brands. You're bound to get lucky and find a cheaper product that won't bust after eight weeks."
77722,0,"i ordered Monoi Tiare Tahiti oil. When i recieved the oil it was ""well like oil,"" but the next morning it looked like grease that sit on the stove after it cools, i had to sqeeze it to get a little out of it. But it still smells good and it makes my skin really soft. I put a little n my hair after i get out of the shower and when it drys it dont look oily. It makes my hair soft n smells great."
47155,1,"I used to be pretty. As my skin has slowly eroded into premature wrinkles (Thanks, sun!), I lost my looks. For the past month, I have been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream along with the serum during the day and the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night. Now, people are telling me how my skin is absolutely glowing and how pretty I look. All I wanted to do was get rid of the wrinkles around my mouth, which this product did, but I didn't expect to look prettier. At almost 54 years old, I can't tell you what a kick this is!"
201031,1,I purchased this cologne on a whim and simply love it! I seem to be approached more at the clubs when wearing it AND the best part is that it puts my male boss in a much better mood almost instantly! Crazy I know..but true! I wear it by itself or to enhance another fragrance.
147791,1,"Great Price fast shipping.Have used this in the past and loved it,Just couldn't pass up the price.Then got it in 2 days with free shipping, what a deal."
35292,0,"I was trying to find the old Bijan fragrance that came in the bottle looking a &#34;b&#34; with a gold color. You can still get that fragrance if you buy the oils in the mall, but cannot find it online. This is not a bad fragrance a little on the wimpy side and the fragrance does not last, not what I was expecting or used to from the old Bijan, and not an all day cologne."
216820,1,I bought this product and I must say it is by far one of the best colognes ever. This is a must have for all men. 100% love it and so do the ladies.
108769,0,"If you're going to buy Salon Bronze buy it from Sally's Beauty Supply in your local area. That's where I've always bought mine. It has never been green LOL You're buying fake products for way more money. The system is only 11.00 and some change at Sallys. The cartridges are 9 something. This stuff is good for the price but the catridges do run out very fast,the tan doesn't last long,and it is very messy. Will have your floors and walls dark brown and nasty. And your feet will be super brown and ew on the bottom. But for a quick cheap tan it is ok"
147747,2,"nice packaging - however, no information. should i use a tablespoon or a half cup? don't know 'cuz there are no directions. i gave it one star because the program requires a rating -- perhaps it deserves 4 stars"

48280,0,I used to relax my hair a lot but now i just straighten it. I would recommend and buy again if need be in the future!
203030,2,"I purchased this product because it had gone on sale and was now significantly cheaper than my normal go-to brand, MAC. I had heard many people rant and rave about this eyeshadow, and since they were finally affordable, I caved to see what the big deal was. Even though I was able to nab this product for $4.80/color it was still a huge waste of money....I purchased colors:- Half Baked: A mediocre brown. Wasn't over glittery like many other colors, but wasn't better than my usual makeup, either.- Kiddie Pool: An okay teal. Again, wasn't over glittery like many other colors, but wasn't better than my usual makeup, either.- Mary Jane: This was my favorite color of the bunch. Was shimmery but not glittery and went on very smooth. A pretty silvery blue.- Midnight Cowboy: This is supposedly their most popular color, and I do not understand how. This color is horrendous and is practically SOLID glitter. I ended up with so much glitter ALL over my face. Epic fail.- Midnight Cowboy Rides Again: Another disaster. Overly glitter and just an overall hot mess.- Midnight Cowgirl: I liked this color. It's a bit into the yellow tones for my liking as a go-to neutral color, but it highlights the eye area nicely. However, it is very glittery and difficult to apply because of the fallout.- YDK: An okay brown. Not atrocious like some of the others, but I'm still not going to pick it over my usual brand of makeup.- Strip: This is a nice velvety and shimmery vibrant gray. I liked this color. It was easy to apply and didn't contain chunks of glitter.- Purple Haze: Horrendous. Doesn't blend at all. Impossible to apply and spread evenly onto eyelid. This seems to be a problem with their purple tones...- Psychadellic Sister: Blech. Does not spread onto eyelid evenly, there are always bald spots, and I use a professional and expensive eyelid primer. Again, this is a purple color, and their purples, for whatever reason, are garbagey and do not spread.- Ecstasy: Another purple. Slightly better than the other purples but needs multiple, multiple applications to sort of be applied evenly. Texture is just funny, I don't know what is wrong with their purple dyes...So, out of 11 products, I have 3 that I actually like and use (Mary Jane, Midnight Cowgirl, and Strip), 3 that are mediocre but not stellar enough to make it into regular rotation (Half Baked, Kiddie Pool, and YDK), and 5 that are trash-tastic and will be given to my 10-year old cousin for dress-up play-time (Midnight Cowboy, Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, Purple Haze, Psychadellic Sister, and Ecstasy)."
238860,0,"This is a very nice perfume. Its not too strong, and it doesn't wear off too quickly. It has a nice rosy smell to it, and is definatly worth the buy :)"
3405,0,I want a really rich deep conditioner. This wasn't it. I didn't feel like it left a lasting impact. Smells great though. Probably better for super fine hair that doesn't need the extra weight.
251218,0,"Everything turned out really good besides the face the henna package had a rip in it after i opened the mail packaging and it spilt everywhere, but it worked nicely and looked great :)"
237719,0,"I must give credit for the quality of this soap however; I can't stand the scent. I am so disappointed. I expected it to smell ""refreshing"" but it reminds me of industrial cleaner instead of a body soap scent. As a kid the janitor at school used to sprinkle a Choloform dusting material on the floor before pushing it behind a big wide broom to clean the halls....the scent of this soap reminds me of that. I am sorry that I put faith into this and bought the 64 oz jug. My fault, I should have tried it out first in a small container. Looks like this will be used to bath the dogs, as a cleaner, etc. but not as a body soap."
218636,0,These really do work if you can ever get your ear ring through them. It was too difficult and time consuming for me.
178035,2,"I purchased the perfume as a gift. When I opened the package I could strongly smell the perfume and discovered that it had leaked out of the top of the bottle onto the bottle, box, and packaging. Some of the perfume was missing as a result of this. If I was purchasing this for myself, it wouldn't have been as big of a concern, but it was embarassing giving it to someone as a gift with some of it missing."
207923,0,"Like another Amazon reviewer said, it lathers well. It has an unassuming masculine scent. It cleans well enough, although I like it when a soap, like Irish Spring, kind of makes you feel that cleanliness as well. It advertises ""refreshing,"" but this body lotion doesn't really do that, although it is effective. I think also it's much too easy to use too much of it, so the bottle's contents disappear quickly. What's especially nice about this soap is that it isn't costly, so I don't regret the purchase. I also didn't get a really good take on how well it moisturizes the skin. There's no statement on the bottle that it will moisturize, which is kind of curious. . . ."
223120,1,"Another ""hard to find"" item!!Right on my doorstep, thanks to Amazon!This is the best Shower gel ever!I have used it for years."

199813,2,"Be careful! The perfum was faked! Do not buy! I compared the smell with a genuine one, from a decente store. It is very different!"
170394,1,I love this color. I am always getting compliments about it. My only complaint is that over time it has gotten a little thicker which makes it harder to put on evenly without bubbling as it dries.
47489,0,My hair dresser loves this product - says it is the only kind she buys. I wasn't impressed with it. It suds nicely but I didn't find the scent lasted any longer than another brand and didn't find that it softened my skin. Plus it is rather expensive. Don't think I'll order again.
138461,0,I'm pretty sure I paid a bit of a premium to get this before Christmas but it's my youngest son's first 'real' cologne...
64753,1,"This is not a me too fragrance. It is distinctive, subtle and sophisticated. As the oils mix with your own, the fragrance continues to evolve and improve. The only negative is that it begins to fade after about 5-6 hours."
158295,0,"I originally had bought it for my daughter. She is mixed (African American). She has real kinky, curly hair. It worked well as a detangler, but didn't do much for her curls. In just a couple of hours her hair was back to the dull dryness.I decided to try it on my curls. I'm Portuguese with naturally curly hair and it worked way better for me. I didn't have to use any hairspray with it either. On the same note though, it didn't leave my hair looking shiny. It eliminated the frizz but, the dryness was still there. I still think it worked a lot differently for my hair.I won't purchase it again. For around $25 (with shipping) it didn't WOW me enough. I need something that will work for both of us and with complete satisfaction."
150970,2,The thick Velcro straps make it uncomfortable on the tops of the ears and painful to wear. Find a mask with soft straps.
173124,0,"Just as other reviewers have noted, the sunblock does clump up into tiny wrinkles and folds in the skin after you've applied it for some time. You'll notice this where the skin of your neck folds or other joints on your body (elbows, knees, etc.). When you are active the sunblock also tends to gather into beads of sweat and is noticeable because they turn a milky white (somewhat embarrassing). Because of this I'm not sure how accurate the term sweat-proof is. It did nevertheless protect my skin from would-be burns on high sun exposure days. I haven't decided if I will use this product again though I may potentially come back to it once I have tried out other products."
2183,2,"Not a very powerful motor, feels very light and flimzy... Fine for trimming sideburns. For $16.99 you get what you pay for. Not too many other cordless options out there for this price."

The Sulfur part of this soap will tarnish certain jewelry metals, I have had two silver rings and a silver and stainless neckless cross turn black after using this soap regularly . sulfur is known for blackening of certain metals..."
172908,1,"First off, I'm in my early 20's and have combination type skin with occasional, mild to moderate acne. I used nearly two whole ProActiv systems before switching to a Neutrogena kit and have found that this clears up my skin much better and faster. I find it very convenient that the Day Lotion includes SPF 15, whereas the ProActiv Repairing Lotion doesn't, even though ProActiv advises you to use sunscreen with their system when going outside. That would probably prompt you to buy their oil-free moisturizer with SPF 15 as well ($$ smart business move $$), thus adding another step to your skin-care regimen. I would recommend anyone with my acne/skin type who is thinking about subscribing to ProActiv to try Neutrogena first.Anyway, the Neutrogena kit lasts around 5 months for me. I still get an occasional zit or two, but with less frequency than I did in the past. I use a Neutrogena Rapid Clear spot gel for that with success.Word of advice: It might be best if you shake the tube of acne cleanser before you start using it. When I was finishing up what was left of the last tube I used, I discovered that all the ""micro-fine beads"" were gathered there, afloat at the very top somehow. I've been wondering where those were all along..."
50504,0,This is a great file for problem nails and came to me in a plastic tube to help protect. The only thing I didn't like was the length of the file. I was used to one about 8 inches long. This one is a runt. It is about 5 inches long. The advertisement for this file doesn't tell you it's size.
211886,2,"I was very excited to use the Clarisonic Pro to remove my daily makeup. The instructions say that it can be used daily. I used it almost daily for about 5 days (I skipped a few days) but then I noticed that I started to break out all over my face in areas I normally don't have problems with. It actually became quite severe which caused me some distress. Once I realized what had happened, I immediately stopped using it. Would I have to go through a bad phase first to achieve the benefit? I will not know as I have no desire to re-challenge the product. I am very disappointed that it did not work out for me.My husband, on the other hand, uses it quite frequently and hasn't had the break out issues as I have had. He feels as if his face is cleaner. We are fortunate that he can use it. If I had purchased it just for me, it would have been a waste of money."

It smells so bad, so when it's on your lips- you can actually smell it! I thought it was just mine ...But I looked it up and others have the same review! I don't know if this is a big deal for others, but it makes a difference to me. $26 is a lot for a lipgloss that stinks!"

As to the response time, however, I would definitely recommend this seller."
185614,0,Nice nail color however chips by day 6.. Right price but overpriced for shipping. I purchased another nail color from them at the same time. I got two shipping charges when both nailpollishes come in the same $3 shipping/us postage paid envelope ! I paid $12 in shipping. What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
40387,1,"this product works better than I thought it would. every time that i use it, my polish now lasts up to 5 days! ordering was easy and the product was delivered in a short time!"
53734,2,I agree with the other raters that this a poor quality product. I can do better using a magnified mirror and a table lamp. I returned it within a few days.
21151,2,This color looks pretty in the picture but it's very dark and old looking. I returned it. Google images the colors before you buy so you know what the true color looks like
169472,0,"I've been using this for about a month now and it works pretty well. I've also used The Art of Shaving's pre-shave lotion and while they seem to work, I *hate* the greasy, oily feel they both have. Granted, after you've shaved, your face doesn't feel greasy, but it still kind of grosses me out. I've used Zirh's pre-shave oil and it's not greasy whatsoever. I think I'm going to go back to that or I'm going to keep looking."

14982,1,"I reside in a hot and dusty locality, with lots of minerals. For years my Belgian neighbors have complained (lots of arguing) about the lackluster foliage on the tea tree in my front yard. After many attempts, I was at the end of my rope, contemplating the chain-saw as a solution. Then someone in my group suggested Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo, and I gave it a try. Now I get nothing but compliments!For best results, mix one 55-gallon drum of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo with 5000 gallons of lukewarm rainwater and apply generously to your tea tree with an aircraft de-icing boom-truck. Make sure you work it into the branches nearest the trunk. Allow it to soak for half a day. To rinse, ignite the dead branches near the base of the tree and call the fire department.Hope this helps!"
5093,0,"The coverage was light indeed. Really, it was too light. Also, it didn't feel as moisturizing as other similar products I've used."
222908,0,OK as a moisturizer but doesn't do what it claims. Not worth the money I payed for it. To bad.
22966,2,"I loved this hairdryer for the first three months I had it. Then, it started whining and smoking. I thought, ""No problem, I'll return it to BioIonic, and they will replace it."" I had saved all the warranty information so read the directions. BioIonic wants $18.95 to send it to the repair center. That is completely absurd! They charge over $100.00 for a hairdryer that only works three months, and they want me to pay more? I will never buy anything made by this company again."
55870,1,Very hard to find so I keep a stock on hand. It works great and I would recommend to anyone.
60102,1,Pretty good product as long as you keep using it on a regular basis. Its keen to the chemical peel at the dermatologist office. My dermatologist said it was working well.
204123,0,"The product is great- but the shipping was outrageous... The company changed the amount charged for shipping and when I called to ask why it was an additional $3.00, they stated that the $5.95 was their base price and then they charged per ounce of product -- 18 ounces of lotion cost an additional $3.00; $8.95 for shipping, $9.95 for the lotion- would have been cheaper to purchase at a local store. They didn't seem to really know what was going on and the product came wrapped in old newspapers.. Not very professional.

41354,2,"i bought this because it got really great reviews, but no matter what formula i use (base coat/topcoat/timing), its too soft, and easily smudges. It also chips just as bad as $1 Brucci. Worse actually. I'm not impressed"
143972,1,These wash cloths are not for those with delicate or hyper-sensitive skin. They are a bit rougher than the more common round ball scrubbies and sand off any bumps. Great for people with oily or acne-prone skin. Everyone in our family has one and we all love them.

175927,0,"Okay I love the fact that I can now buy great natural products, but c'mon what is with all these natural product becoming so...I don't know? Um... useless. I buy exclusively natural and chemical free cosmetics and I'm finding it harder and harder to find products that are reasonably priced they actually work. This is a RINSE not a wash. It doesn't lather hardly at all, which doesn't bother me as long as it's getting me clean. I don't work in a garage or anything I'm not covered in motor oil or anything like that, I'm just washing off the days dirt. This gel doesn't wash anything off and frankly the smell is...weird. Not sure why someone would think this smelled like honey or mango. It smells like sour bananas. The first time I used it I had to wash off the gel with something else...lol I love Alba and I suggest their products regularly but this one is not great."

177487,0,"I did expect more out of this round brush, but it is gentle on the hair. It will smooth it out . i purchased the jumbo 2.5 and a smaller one. The jumbo works to smooth hair out while blowdrying quicker and can handle more hair than the smaller sizes. They didnt add much volume like I hoped , but it is a good brush that will most likely keep hair healthy if you blow dry a lot."
129251,1,"I'm addicted to this product. Makeup comes off easily and yet it's gentle on the skin. I also like the sweet, clean smell. You are cleaning your face with 17 amino acids and vital nutrients. I have used this product for over three years and won't switch to anything else."
14701,1,This was highly recommended by my doctor for my severely dry hands and feet as a side effect of chemotherapy. Udderly Smooth smells very nice and moisturizes without that greasy feeling. I use it about 5-6 times daily and know it has really helped reverse the chapped irritated skin.
51387,0,"Let me start by saying that the product and the service are very good. I liked the oil and the slightly exotic scent.My problem with this oil is that it solidifies (except during a summer heat wave) and in this state is extremely difficult to squeeze out of the tiny opening of the bottle, and often ends up making a mess, if it finally squirts out and lands on your shower curtain In a greasy blob! It should be packaged in a jar, and the it would be a 5 star product.Being environmentally conscious, I do not like that I need to run hot water over the bottle to get the product out..."

When I finally got the package in the mail, I was surprised at how quickly it came; in two days. But disappointment came when tried the fragrance. This was not the original fragrance. It smelled like crap. Great when it put it on, but in 2 minutes the scent was gone. Do you self a favor, purchase your fragrances from Saks, Bloomingdales, or Macy's if you can. That is what I plan to do from now on... Same on you Amazon for selling FAKE stuff."

I didn't see that information on the Amazon site. Beware. Might get good reviews, but this isn't natural."

233707,1,"My hair was being ruined at salons that think nothing of applying hair coloring, dyes and highlights that wreak havoc with the condition of one's hair. After going without any kind of hair coloring for almost one year, I decided to try Henna. I used the Henna coloring for grey hair and it not only came out wonderfully brown but it left my hair in such a wonderful condition, I'll never return to a salon and pay their over-priced fees for ruining my hair.I purchased the Henna neutral for my sister who didn't need color but wanted a natural conditioner. We're both sold on the products.Beware! Do not use henna if you have recently had your hair chemically treated. Wait at least three months! Otherwise, the henna will have a nasty reaction to the chemically-treated hair and you will not be happy. I used coffee rather than water when mixing the henna so that I would have more brown and less red. And, I laid a heating pad on top my head to create a ""heat source"". (this helps the henna to color the hair). Since my grey hair is resistant to color, I let the henna set for three hours. (Sounds like a long time but I just turned the afternoon into a ""spa day"" ...doing a manicure, pedicure and facial at home while waiting for the henna to set.Usually, the hair coloring treatments I get at salons fade within 7-10 days and my grey reappears within a week. I've used henna almost three weeks ago and the grey is still covered. Not bad for a $10 product that I can use at home.If you are hesitant about using the henna, do a little research online. There are plenty of sites with lots of information. Educate yourself first, then try it. I was spending anywhere from $60 to $140 to have my hair colored every six weeks...With henna...that extra money is being used to enjoy some dinners out with my husband!"
84572,1,"This product is amazing! It gives you a warm summer glow even in the winter. The color looks like a light bronzer and it not too bright or heavy, but very light and glowy! The seller shipped it very quickly to an Apo address (overseas)."
200012,0,"I have long (4 inch below shoulder), straight hair with a bit of a frizz. I have never been able to get a salon finish with my old hair dryer and this one for sure brought me closer. But I think the claims are too much.--My hair is long and this a heavy dryer (3 lbs). I get quite tired after using it and especially when I am doing the back hair.--It does leave the hair softer but since the dryer motor is weaker than salon quality hair dryers, it has less pull which means less control. It is harder to do anything more than the basic straight blow drying quickly. For finishing the ends, you end up relying more on the brush than the dryer.--I did not notice the drying time to be faster which is supposed to be the one of the big advantages of ionic dryers.Overall I think the dryer works well for its price with some anti-frizz product. I would not expect to be able to do salon style look in 10 mins or even 20 mins as most of the reviews claim.I will be returning this."
179482,2,this product is bad....I have purchased Tuscany as gift for my daughter for years......this perfume does not smell the same....waste of money.
162983,1,"This product has been a lifesaver for me! After years of experimenting with a variety of the most expensive serums, creams, etc. to numerous drugstore products, DeVita products are the best of the best. It has transformed my skin, making me look years younger. The last couple of years I dreaded going out in public because my facial skin was so unattractive, even with makeup. I suffered with constant facial skin irritations that my dermatologist was unable to diagnose. It was either a severe allergy or perhaps eczema or psoriasis. Since I had mild psoriasis on my scalp, I observed some of the same symptoms. The derm prescribed numerous prescriptions and finally resorted to steroids which helped while using them but caused a variety of other problems. So I asked my derm to prescribe 1% Tazorac gel (a vitamin A type gel) but still continued having the same problem periodically along with peeling skin, some roughness, and occasional breakouts. By alternating the DeVita High Performance Glycolic Acid (12% AHA) every fourth night with the Tazorac on the other nights, these problems have been solved. Finally, clear and more youthful looking skin after only a few weeks of use! If you have dry skin, DeVita Evening Rich Nutritional Moisturizer can be used over either product after leaving them on your skin for about 15-30 minutes. The DeVita product line is one of the best on the market since only the most effective and safest ingredients are used. Other wonderful DeVita products include the Optimal Rejuvenation, Eye Lift Creme, and Solar Protective Facial Moisturizer SPF 30+. Try it, and you'll love it too! Did I mention that I'm almost 70 years old and have been told that I could pass for 50 since I have been using Devita products?"
156554,0,Edited - the seller refunded my purchase due to Amazon's mistake of uploading the wrong picture.I'm disappointed in this purchase. The color shown is a bright pink but the actual color is a bright coral/sherbert orange color. The seller must have uploaded the wrong photo. When I Googled the color I did find the orange color. I won't lose sleep over $5 nail polish but will be more careful in the future in trusting the seller having the correct color displayed.

166724,2,"I purchased the Fake Bake self tanner. It is a horrible product. It is streaky, malodorous, and extremely over priced. If you accidentally get it on anything, like clothing or the skin, it stains. At $20, it is a total rip off. I will never buy this product again and would give it 0 stars if it was possible."
232615,2,"I've used this product for about 3 weeks now. I feel no positive difference in my hair, and if anything, my hair feels a bit dryer than before even. I'm discontinuing the use of this stuff and moving on to a (hopefully) better reconstructing conditioner that will actually help. This stuff really wasn't for me."
95256,0,They heat up nice and fast but the clips are kind of flimsy and don't hold the rollers in place very well. I have never used hot rollers before so maybe I just need some practice.
159560,1,"My skin is oily in the Tzones, dry around my cheeks and normal everywhere else.This product has kept my skin smooth and soft. It is supposed to be worn under another heavy moisturizer.. However, I think it is moisturizing enough. It might even be too moisturizing for my skin over the summer.I use this product with Olay's Total Effects Anti Blemish creme. In the reviews it said that the product would dry out your skin. I have mild acne, and proactiv and other topical cremes dried out my skin waaaay too much. This product has been wonderful. No breakouts-- and I have really sensitive skin."
209794,0,"The product doesn't justify the price. Although I wasn't dissatisfied with the performance, there are other products that are just as good for a fraction of the price. I've tried so many facial cleansers and personally think the results of Amla are very similar to Clinique's foaming cleanser. They both leave that squeeky clean feeling. I don't mind splurging for excellent facial products, but they must be truly fabulous. The Amla cleanser simply is not."
53042,1,"Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn't much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit), I LOVED how my eyelashes looked. Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!) even the little blonde tips.I recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research), so I'm doing an experiment, side by side.What I have found - I think Roux is the exact kind of lash tint the salon used. It cost me about $5 (including shipping) on eBay for a single application (I recommend trying it that way). Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.The draw-backs of the Roux lash tint experiment:1) All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily. I had to pierce some of the chemicals with a safety pin to open it, and even then had trouble dipping the wands into the chemicals.2) The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black) turned my fingertips black. The instructions said to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anywhere you don't want turning black, and I faithfully ringed my eyes below and to the eyebrow, but never thought of putting it on my fingertips! :) Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar. Oh well, it'll fade.3) Because I was doing a self-tint, I had to do one eye at a time. I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes. The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second. That tells me there's a bit of a learning curve.4) My lower lashes aren't really dyed at all. I went back over them at the end, but they just didn't dye. I think maybe there was petroleum jelly on them.So... that is my review of Roux. I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box). I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don't need to keep your eyes shut the whole time, it doesn't sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand). But I will have to see for myself."
237709,1,"This soap has made my life just so much better. My skin is now as soft and evenly toned as I've always wanted it to be and I'm getting it done without the use of harsh and unnecessary chemicals. But as a toothpaste this stuff really made my day. My mouth feels clean and fresh and there's no toxic fluoride! I even had a periodontal condition in my mouth where the gum line beneath my two front bottom teeth was receding, this is the whole reason I bought the stuff in the first place, and it turned out to be a total blessing because not only are my gums returning to normal my teeth are getting whiter after just about a week of usage. I was worried that I was going to have to see a doctor and being an American without health insurance, the health care I would've subscribed to would have financially devastated me and probably have not even worked. If you have sensitive skin/gums/scalp you should really give this soap a try. I used it in my laundry too to avoid the usage of chemical detergents. I hate chemicals! You should try this soap. Or gift it to someone who you think could benefit. They'd love you for it!"
227007,0,"I read reviews to get an idea of how to use this, having never used one (though needed it!) before.Price was cheap enough I wanted to see how it worked. Instructions only tell you how to change the blade. Not sure if I'm doing it right and not sure how far to go, but it works. I just wish I knew how to use it correctly."
130709,0,reduce just alittle bit of shedding and not bad for the price. think the using odorless garlic and carrier oil is more effective than this shampoo and and alter ego garlic treatment for shedding. leave this product on for a few mins to get effect.
210037,2,"Ordered a D&G Light Blue 3.4 oz perfume bottle from seller ""Jacobs Enterprises"" as a present for my mother. When it arrived, my mother complained that the perfume didn't smell anything like it was supposed to and that it barely had any of the longevity that it used to have with the store bought bottle she used. That's what I get for being cheap. It's better to buy perfume at the store to avoid getting a knock-off, lesson Learned."
135971,2,"I had pretty high hopes for this scent, as I'd had Demeter fragrances in the past and they were consistently good. Unfortunately, Tomato Seeds Cologne isn't as authentic as I hoped. Too alcohol-y and astringent, with little or no tomato scent. I'm guessing it's just a difficult smell to translate to a perfume, and not a lack of quality from Demeter.I might just stick to their florals."
244816,1,"I've never done an amazon review before, but I had to give props to Lac-Hydrin 5 when I saw it listed here. My dermatologist suggested I use this a few years ago when I was taking Accutane, which causes serious dry skin. It was the best lotion I've ever used. It has the amazing quality of going on very lightly and easily (not oily at all) but still being very moisturizing. It's also unscented. I love it."

83847,0,"I have to say I would be surprised for someone to get any results in one day. I have been using this product for over a month and still nothing. I am hopeful that it will get better, but most people said I should expect some good results in 3-4 weeks. So far no difference and my nails aren't int hat bad of shape. My nails are still completely brittle and constantly breaking. Fingers crossed that they get stronger soon."
207847,0,I have used this product for a few days and I would say that its okay. There really is nothing special about it as far as I can feel or see. I uploaded a picture for all to see that the bottle is very small and is almost the size of a tweezerman deluxe shaving brush. Will I buy this again for $29? Probably not.
27341,2,My wife really likes this make-up mirror and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if they hadn't changed what is included. This is the third one she's had since she first found them. The other two came with the AC Adapter. So when I ordered this one I ASSUMED it would be the same. Stupid me! They now makle you buy one separately! And if you try to purchase from Zadro (the manufacturer) they will soak you more for the shipping than for the adapter! (The adapter plus shipping is almost one-half of the price of the mirror!)WHAT A RIP OFF!
6721,2,"After reading a lot of reviews here, I decided to try this dryer. I have a dryer that I love, but I thought I should try to find a back-up for the inevitable time when mine dies. The one I have is a vortex dryer(with a bell shaped end) that lifts the hair as it dries and is wonderful! Anyway, I can't find the same model, so I tried this Revlon model. Oh my...I have shoulder length color treated hair, kind of medium thickness and I ended up with a fuzzy mess! I gave up before it was quite dry and went back to my other dryer. I wish I would have had time to start over, but I would have been late for work. Ugh....hate a bad hair day. Another thing....the on/off switch is at a bad place. I kept turning it off as I was using it! My thumb kept hitting the switch. So....its not for me, but YMMV(your mileage may vary)."
207215,0,This is a good product but is too liquidy. It needs to be thicker. When you press the pump its almost like water and you can't keep it in your hand. It sloshes out. Because of the consistancey( or lack of) it is easy to get in your eyes since it runs right off your face. I'm going to mix it with another face cleaner that is thicker so that its not a total waste.
34786,2,"Do not buy this product!! The polish doesn't stay on your nails, it peels off easily. Not worth the money!!"
146968,2,I smelled Tomato at a boutique a number of years ago and loved it. This stuff is hideous. It smells more like the carrying medium than tomatoes. It's the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon in the past 14 years. Wish i could return it but I can't because it's a flammable substance.

209320,0,"I have very dark brown hair and my gray hairs are coming in very white. They stand out in contrast to the rest of my hair, so even though I don't have lots of gray hair, I decided to try dying it. I used naturtint (4N Natural Chestnut). It was $15 at Whole Foods. I have not died my hair since I was in college and this is the first time I died my hair specifically to cover gray. The 4N color came out very dark and basically matches my natural color. It has a pretty golden shine in the light like my natural color, and no red tones. It feels soft and healthy. The dye has a very mild and pleasant smell, not chemy at all. There was more than enough dye to cover all of my shoulder length hair, and I had some left over. I left it on for 40 minutes. Although I like the color, I am a little disappointed with the results. The white is not totally covered. The white hairs look darker than before, but they are not as dark as the rest of my hair. They look kind of like highlights, and blend in to the rest of my hair much better than before, but I can still tell where they are. I'm a little worried that they may come back very soon. Overall, it's a good product, but I might try something else next time to see if I get better coverage."
63031,2,"I am a hiker and have a ball of foot problem on my right foot. I was looking for something to take the pressure off the front of my foot and thought these were worth a try. On first trying them I found them very uncomfortable, especially in my trail shows which have some of their own arch support. The pressure on the arch area, with the lowest insert, was more than I expected. I found that my hiking boots, with no arch support and with the original inserts removed, were tolerable with the walkfit so I decided to try wearing them. I started by wearing them to work, then for a short walk (about a mile) and gradually up to a longer hike (6 miles, significant elevation change). The walkfit was never comfortable, but it did take the pressure off the front of my foot by putting more of the weight on my arch. During the hike I developed a bruise on my arch and decided that these weren't for me.I think these could be a good option if the arch area had some padding and if the inserts were permanent so they stay in place."
74287,2,"This product alone did nothing for me, that I liked. It left my hair feeling dry. Had to use a good amount of shampoo to get it to feel clean. My hair fell more than usual. Would not waste my money on this product again. And also because I found a good organic shampoo at Walgreens without the need of a conditioner."
162077,0,Yes it is quiet but it in turn lacks air flow volume.Very disappointed in the air flow and also the hand held unit is to large for small amount of air flow?? I have had smaller unit and they had alot more air flow. I guess if you want a quiet unit your going to have to sacrifice air flow but I still can't figure out why hand unit has to be so large?? Also the hi/off/low switch if touched alittle it will move to the off position.Alot of people comment the night light is to bright but I think it's just fine.Also cord hang up knob is GREAT!!! Sorry but overall this would be a bad choice.
153960,1,Great for thinning hair and it really does make your hair thicker. I have used this product for over a year now and when I went to my sisters for a visit she immediately commented on my hair and is now also using the Nexus Vitatress.
211697,0,"of course the color you get not same as on box. If hair is natural black, color will be orange at first then in a week or so color will adjust. If trying to cover grey will need to leave on for the maximum time allowed. The shipping cost is exaggerated and can be duly avoided by a simple local purchase if able"

214049,0,"It is just too heavy for my taste. As a massage oil, with someone rubbing it in for an hour, I am sure it is great. It makes your skin very soft. But after using just a little and rubbing it in for 5 full minutes, although my skin is soft, I can't sit on the bed or on furniture or put on a silk shirt because I am still greasy."
73116,2,"I was pretty strongly disappointed with this purchase. I bought it based on the marketing and I suppose that's what I get.My first thought when trying it out the first time was that I smelled like I belonged in a movie about French Nobility in the 1800s.I asked a few of the women I know what they thought of it and it didn't get very good reviews from them. ""Powdery"", ""You smell like twice your age"", ""Smells like grandpa cologne"".It's relatively subtle, and not entirely unpleasant, but it's not the sort of cologne I would wear out on a date or out on the town. I'd really recommend finding a sample first to see if it's the sort of thing you'd like to wear."
22090,0,"I'm currently pregnant and wanted to try this lotion on myself before baby is born. It is very watery but moisturizes well, a little goes long way.

I prefer LaVanila Baby Lotion much better-great ingredients and truly baby smell."
189157,0,"This is a great looking mirror, and seems sturdy enough when you take it out of the package, set it up, and use it. The mirror flips upside down to a magnification side, which is also lighted around the edge. The only disappointment is that two of the light settings (Evening and Office) are too dim to be of any use. Seems the Office setting was meant to mimic flourescent lighting, but this just doesn't cut it. If you want that effect with this mirror, you'll have to set up a flourescent light next to it. I'd really like it if *all* the settings were brighter. I'm settling for this mirror only because after researching them, I haven't found any other affordable lighted mirrors that are any better than this one."

We're not sure, because she follows my husband around all the time, anyway.)This might make a great gift for your tiger, too.Just watch out...cougars may start following him home."
171604,0,"THE BUBBLES ARE INSUFFICIENTSeriously, there aren't enough bubbles. If you put about a tablespoon of this stuff in, they last about 60 seconds and then you're left with this wonderful, luxurious bath, but it's neither foamy nor bubbly. But you'll smell really good and feel great for a the duration of the bath. But no foam!Still a good product for stress relief and skin care, but not really a bubble bath. I'll buy it again, but not for bubble baths."

I loved it so much that im on my 3rd bottle!!! n since im a perfume/spray collector, i rarely finish even 1 bottle of perfume...n so to me, thats how great this perfume is. Btw this perfume last very long. The perfume packaging is pretty cool n cute&#9825; the scent itself is amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone."

2942,0,Overall it's a gentle and hydrated night cream and I like about its natural ingredients; but its way too oily than all of my other moisturizers. I think it's good for dry skin but not for combination/oily skin. Now I use it as my night hand cream:)

I wish they would return to their original formula (or cleanse the manufacturing facilities to make it feel the same as before). I like the fragrance and it doesn't suck, but its not the same as before."

55159,0,"My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I'd say my feet were going to be ""baby soft"". I wasn't really pleased with the expense, odor, and clammy feel that I'd experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results, so I did some more searching.I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - O'Keefes Creme. This creme is inexpensive, non-greasy, and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive ""baby soft"" feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them."

86779,1,"This product works well, but you have to keep using it! lol! It tastes bad, and will get on whatever your fingers touch, including food. It also stays on your nails for days!"
88488,0,"It's too bad that this lotion is so aggressively scented, because normally I love Better Botanicals for their gently and beautifully scented products. The lotion itself soaks in beautifully without an oily feeling.However, the scent is ridiculously overpowering and aggressively lingers. Even a drop of lotion on your hands will give you a very, very strong scent that will last all day long, through multiple handwashings. If you use enough to moisturize your hands completely, the scent is completely overpowering. My husband, who is mildly sensitive to scent, couldn't be in the same room with it. I'm normally not sensitive to essential oil scents, but I had to stop using it because it started giving me headaches.The first time I used it, I used it only once in the beginning of the day. I washed my hands many times, did dishes, moisturized my hands with some almond oil after doing dishes, took a shower the next morning, and I could still smell the stuff on my hands the next day after all of that.The second time I used this lotion, I hadn't put any on earlier in the day, and I moisturized my hands with a single pump. The scent was so overpowering that I had to wash my hands three times with unscented dish soap to try and reduce the smell, and even after all of that, I could still smell it! I could smell it in the air wherever I had walked or sat before, as well. Essential oils alone shouldn't linger like that - they should evaporate fairly quickly.My guess is that there are some synthetic or highly concentrated scents hiding in this product, or else they're using phthalates to make the scent linger. Either way, it's not good. If you are in any way, shape, or form at all sensitive to scents, even natural ones, do yourself a favor and choose a different lotion.If you love strong-smelling floral-scented lotions, you'll probably like this. But check with your co-workers and stuff before you use it regularly, as it definitely triggers headaches and other scent-based reactions in those who are even the most mildly sensitive."

199581,0,"I bought these because I thought they were single use petals, but the soap does not breakdown/foam fast enough and so you really have to work it to get the entire petal to foam up. Also, the petal may just break apart and you get bits of soap in the sink or drain, not good."
37560,1,"Dear, dear men, please stop saying that this is a men's cologne and not for women. That is akin to saying that a woman cannot smoke cigars or drink scotch. Please don't allow your passe hang-ups deter a young lady from trying what may become something she loves. I am a lady. This is my signature scent. It is sexy, dark, strong and complex. Like me. I also wear pants, vote, and drive. My point: Leave your gender-role rigidity at home and review the cologne."
134073,1,"I've been looking for awhile that works for fine hair without it losing body our that smells like a women's fragrance.I have used more than a few other men's shampoo's and body washes, and though I like a few of the body washes, I haven't found a decent shampoo conditioner combo that works as well as the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage products do. My hair is very fine and is past my shoulders in length. It seems as if many of the men's products work great for short hair, but they are not that great for men that have hair that is a little longer. The shampoo really cleans my hair (which tends to get a little oily a day after washing) and leaves it feeling light with a nice shine. The Body wash is also great leaving me feeling clean without the irritation I've had from some other Tea Tree body washes. The Conditioner takes out the tangles without a heavy feel to it after using it. I have used one or two other conditioners that work about as well, but they tend to leave a scent that is a little too flowery for my tastes.Over all I feel I've found something outstanding for men who have fine hair and would recommend it to anyone, but for those of us who sport longer hair it's simply the best solution I've found.By the way my wife has hated some other Tea Tree men's hair products because of the smell, but this doesn't leave the smell of Tea Tree but a light lemon sage scent that's barely noticeable."
240427,0,"The lavender gel hand sanitizer is great because it doesn't dry out your skin - i prefer the lemon scented one over the lavender but it still smells nice. I feel my hands are getting germs killed without ripping off a layer of my skin. I keep bottles in my car, at my house, and in my pockets. I can't leave the house without any! It is all natural so it won't harm me, plus it's not greasy and you only need to put a little bit on so you get more for your money."

42,1,I've been wearing Curve by Liz Claiborne for 10 years. It's a great scent and not too strong. I get compliments about how nice I smell every time I wear it. It's the best. I saw this at Marshall's today for $19.99 but $25 for the big bottle with free shipping is still a really good deal.
170922,0,I purchased China Glaze Pool Party & Yellow Polka Dot BikiniThe Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon yellow.I noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color going.The colors are so pretty but you just need so many coats.I used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.I really like China Glaze but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle but like I have said just need too many coats.The polishes also chipped within a day as well.

I have been using the product for about a month and I am very pleased. Cleans face very well, doesn't leave it dry or give it that ""tight"" feeling. When I use toner afterwards, very little dirt (if any) shows up. My skin is very sensitive and I haven't had any adverse reactions. Will definitely buy again."

191224,0,"I haven't bought a new hair dryer in 20 years. I blow dry so infrequently that my old windmere still works. But I figured it was time to get a better, safer dryer.I chose this dryer based on the price and reviews. Modern dryers are all much bigger and heavier than the old ones which is kind of annoying. If any part of this dryer overhangs the edge of the counter, the whole thing starts to slide off.The dryer itself works well, my hair is quite thick and I thought it worked very quickly to get my hair to an almost dry state. (I never blow all the way dry to keep the hair healthier.) I also like the cool air option. The cord is definitely long enough for use when you're at the bathroom counter. It's great to have it so neatly tuck away inside the dryer.My only caution is retracting the cord. It snaps back pretty fast which cause the plug end with it's safety block to whish around. It banged into the cabinets and almost knocked something off the counter as it flipped around. I would suggest holding the plug end as you retract the cord so you don't hurt someone."
126079,0,"This product works very well, if you wish to deal with the mud residue. It was very messy and it was very hard to get the residue off of my stainless steel sinks in the house. I also purchased this product for my grandson and it was too strong for his skin problem. Therefore, its a good idea to put an age limit for its use."

234285,0,The first time i used this lotion i got out of the bed and thought i had completely fried myself. my skin was so red and itchy but after an hour or so it went away and i had a nice tan. I definantly reccomend having a base tan first but overall i like it. I don't use the lotion if i have to go somewhere right after i hit the tanning bed because of how red and uncomfortable i am for a little while after.
194411,2,"The color of this nail polish is breath taking in person. I find myself actually staring serenely at my nails just mesmerized by the color. However, this nail polish Turned up Turquoise is the absolute worst for chipping that I have ever used. I used a base coat (China Glaze) AND a top coat (Sally Hansen Insta-Dri)and within 1 hours, I suffered chipping on almost all my nails. In all fairness, I am a cashier and I work 8 and a half hours a day. But I have never had a nail polish fail on me after 1 hour. I am not ready to give up quite yet, because I am so in love with the color. Maybe next time I will use 2 coats of top coat. This is not a good nail polish for long term wear. Also as a side note: Without a top coat, this nail polish appears matte."

I've been using apple cider vinegar to treat this but it doesn't always work for me. After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp. It's squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up! Yay!There's also no smell! I've tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)Btw, haven't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)"
91466,0,"I'm absolutely in love with the smell of this cologne. It's gardenia with a little extra ""summery"" kinds of scents but mostly gardenia.Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but I find the scent of this doesn't last at all. Within a half hour of applying it, I can only smell it if I put my wrist right up to my nose. I thought maybe it was just my sense of smell or my allergies were kicking in or something but my husband couldn't smell it either unless he got really close.I wear Elizabeth Arden ""Red Door"", Diane Von Furstenberg ""Tatiana"", Estee Lauder ""Beautiful"", Elizabeth Taylor ""Passion"" on a fairly regular basis and also different bath and body works sprays and have never had a scent fade on me so quickly.I don't want it to reek or anything but I need for it to be longer lasting. I can't be applying it every hour and for that reason, I don't think I would buy it again but will look for another gardenia perfume."
167188,0,"Growing up on the beaches of Southern California with an Irish/English/German heritage wasn't the easiest thing when it came to skin care. That's why I was elated when in the 1980's lotion companies realized that aloe vera was the way to go when it came to saving one's skin.When the market began to move in this direction, almost every lotion manafacturer took a stab at marketing their own aloe vera lotion. The results were, I'm sorry to say, hit and miss. One common mistake companies made (and still do) was the inclusion of artificial color in their gel. This was done to produce a green-colored lotion (the actual color of aloe vera gel is clear, sometimes almost translucent - anything but green). Maybe it tested well, who knows, but I can say the less artificial color in a product the better, especially if you're allergic to it.But coloring was only the tip of the iceberg. It got much worse over time.The biggest sin of modern aloe vera gels has been the inclusion of unneeded chemicals, some of which have been proven to be quite harmful to one's health. I was a big fan of Fruit of the Earth and its products until Japanese researchers released reports showing the carcinogenic qualities of Triethanolamine. Then there was ""perservatives/antimicrobials DMDM Hydantoin and Diazolidinyl Urea; chemicals [that] work by releasing Formaldehyde into the product, which kills any microbes and is great for the product... but not so great for you, because Formaldehyde is a potent carcinogen as well as an irritant that can cause allergic reactions.""Ouch. All of which makes Fruit of the Earth one of the most ironically named companies around.Lily of the Desert, on the other hand, produces some decent gel, but its past inclusion of Carrageenan in products is/was a cause for concern. Researchers have shown that this substance may play a role in the development of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disorders. Of course, Carrageenan has been used in food since the 1930's and since most research has been directed at the ingestion of this substance, I'm not sure what the result of topical application might be. Whatever the case, I'm guessing it ain't good.Recent products from Lily of the Desert would appear to exclude this substance, evidence perhaps that the company is responding to feedback. The more recent use of phenoxyethanol and lactoperoxidase as perservatives may have some raising their eyebrows, but a quick study on the pair assuages any fear you might have.But the effects of aloe vera on one's skin cannot be disputed. It is, as many have said, a miracle substance, one of which we are only now beginning to learn the benefits. My advice is to look for the most natural gel you can find. I was going to suggest the brand that Trader Joe's produces, but having looked at its ingredients, I find that it too contains Diazolidinyl Urea. Not a good sign for a so-called ""natural only"" store.There are always others out there. Keep looking!"
101286,0,"I really love the Opi shatter line, and bought the black and silver shatter along with all the katy perry colors. I've tried the silver shatter over all the KP colors, and across plain black. It's cute, but it doesn't shatter as well as the black one does, it kind of globs up a little more than the black does. It's still a really nice addition to my nail polish collection though, I just won't be using it as often as the black shatter :)"

24622,1,There are very few perfumes that I can wear that don't make me sneeze. Lauren Blue is my absolute favorite scent. Lauren Blue is light and fresh. When I wear it I don't feel overpowered by the scent and I don't have people around me complaining about how strong it is. I have been having a difficult time finding it lately so I hope that it doesn't mean that they are fading it out.
227253,2,I can't believe how incredibly drying this shampoo is. It strips every bit of moisture from your hair. I bought it to use on my daughter because she has such dry hair. This made her hair even more dry and straw-like. I used it on my own hair to see what it was like and it's awful. It is more drying then a clarifying shampoo. I definitely won't be buying this again.
24301,1,Wonderful product. Easy to get at items. Easy to see everything that you have. Seems durable and easy to carry or pack.

6405,0,"If I remember correctly it doesn't say the voltage on device, and the plug has a fuse on it which leads you to believe it's duel voltage. However, when I plugged it into a socket in Hong Kong, it literally Exploded. Dumped in the trash, totally useless. Fuse went up in flames and I didn't have the ability to replace the plug at the time to see if I could get it to work again. Might have been a good dryer otherwise, despite being quite large and plastic feeling.Pros: works on 110 volts, if you only have 110 volt outlets and never travel that's fine.Cons: no voltage switching = plug it into a 220 volt socket and your outlet is going to go up like a flash bang weapon.It worked well as a hair dryer before I went traveling. I wish they would have had a warning considering how common dual voltage is these days. I have similar products and travel a lot and this is the FIRST and only product I've ever had a problem with. I've never had anything go up in flames like this. Considering how much I travel I wouldn't have bought it had I known.I knocked it down to 3 stars because I really feel like it should have stated the voltage clearly, or that it was not dual voltage. it would have saved me from purchasing this, or at least accidentally destroy it, which could have potentially caused damage to my apartment as well. Although it otherwise may be a capable dryer, there is no way I can rate this highly because I see this as a huge lack of over-site and dangerous flaw for electronics these days. I ultimately had to throw it away.Like I said, this might seem trivial if you live in the US and never left the country but it will be a show stopper for some."
59249,0,"So this is my first attempt at using a more natural soap product. I read such great reviews and was hoping to replace many different household products with this one. I'm not completely sold on it but I do like it for a few things. I have used it to wash my son's soccer shinguard socks which get pretty dirty and stinky. This gives it a nice minty clean smell and gets out the dirt. I have tried it as shampoo and my hair felt gross. I tried it as face wash and liked it but was super worried to get it in my eyes and sting, though it did seem to clean my skin without drying. (Have since tried Dr Bronner's Lavender bar soap on face instead and like it for face wash.)I used it as dish soap and hand soap. It didn't get really sudsy for dishes and for hand washing it made my hands feel dry. Overall it did not replace 18 things for me as the label purports. I continue to try it thinking I'll just get used to it. Hoping to use it in some homemade laundry soap ""recipes"" but no big high hopes.Speaking of the label I almost didn't even buy it because of some very unusual preaching on the label (spaceship earth?!) but when I researched a little apparently the family left the label design to honor Dr Bronner though they don't necessarily push the same beliefs now. Fair trade ingredients and a natural product are old school beliefs I'm glad they maintain.Check your local grocery store for the smaller bottles. I paid almost as much for a 4 oz bottle through a seller on Amazon that a 8 oz bottle costs at Target or Kroger. :("

104948,1,"This is my second flat iron, a replacement to a conair 3/4 $15 dollar iron. If you are worried about the cost, DON'T be; it's worth it. My hair has never looked better, and the best part is that it lasts until I wash my hair again. I no longer have to fear drizzle and humidity and rain or going to sleep and waking up with a mess on my head. I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better. There is no fuzziness to my hair when I'm finished and all it takes is one swipe. When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days. And my ends would also looked fried. With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny and it doesn't frizz or fuzz up. And my ends have yet to looked fried while using the Solia. ^_^ My hair also looks healthier than it ever has before."

244048,2,"As others have said, this is not the same product it was. I've used Purpose lotion for 20 years, and when I bought a bottle recently I could tell immediately that the formula had changed. It's thicker and heavier, very much like sunscreen in texture and smell (where it was once almost completely scentless). I haven't had the allergic reactions some have complained of, but the smell is off-putting and it doesn't moisturize as well. I was completely unsurprised to see numerous complaints on Amazon and elsewhere.I won't be buying this again, and for what it's worth plan to tell Johnson & Johnson exactly why. If they changed the formula to save money, as a consumer I'd be willing to pay a bit more for the original product, but the new formulation is worthless to me.I just hope I can find a suitable replacement. I used Purpose for 20 years because it was the only thing I could find that didn't smell unpleasant or make me break out.And to J&J; (and any other company who does this): extremely BAD FORM to change the formula with absolutely no indication that you'd done so.

247381,0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."

83166,0,". . . but I am not as artist. Therefore, I would pay the extra money to have a henna tattoo done. Also, the product comes with a lot of warnings which, I have to admit, scared me. The stain does not seem to last as long as when it is professionally done. I would not buy this product again."
9200,2,"I bought these and I think they suck. My hair stayed curly for maybe an hour (yes, I used hairspray). If that wasn't bad enough, I had some weird crimp mark in each strand where the clip holders were.Previously, I had a set of curlers with the metal pins that held the rollers in place. I'm returning this sad set of rollers and am on a quest to find another set with the metal pins.Don't buy these unless you like spending ridiculous amounts of money for bad products."

195973,2,"If you use this brand you know that this color has been discontinued maybe a year ago. Several years before being discontinued the packaging had been changed from a cover with tapered tip to blunt. The product I received must have been years old. It is in the old packaging with the tapered tip, and actually goes on thicker and darker than expected for this color, probably due to its time on the shelf. The picture actually does show the packaging with the tapered tip, but they don't tell you that not only the picture, but also the product is from the archives."
74811,1,"I love Jao! Beats other hand sanitizers HANDS DOWN. Seriously, I love the way it smells and the way it cleans the city szhmutz off my hands without drying them out like most of the other hand sanitizers. Highly recommended!"
55146,2,"My new dermatologist *who I've since fired, unbeknownst to her* urged me to try this for my Ichthyosis (which it didn't help at all but hey, maybe my skin isn't bad enough for it to work its magic?). I have a VERY mild form of CIE, mind you, but I still have very dry, flaky skin head to foot. Amlactin had a sour smell to it (from the amino acids), making me wonder if others could smell it, and I was still dry and used Cetaphil *BLESS THE CREATORS OF CETAPHIL* after applying it to make sure my skin wasn't flaking. Also, Amlactin stung REALLY BAD when I applied it. Do NOT apply where you just shaved, you will try to escape from your own skin and fail. AND IT'S EXPENSIVE. Honestly, stick with Cetaphil. I get disappointed every time I stray away from out 15 year relationship for some hot flashy new moisturizing product. Fortunately, Cetaphil always takes me back. Definition of true love right there."
201426,2,My cologne smelt good but it had a leak and was all gone like three weeks after receiving the item it was kinda a bummer.
134270,1,"I needed a good hairdryer for camp, the cheap one I bought at Walmart just wasn't cutting it. I had a Chi Turbo for home, but the switch only worked on one setting (due to the constant on/off it took to blow out my thick, curly hair.) I decided to take the Turbo to camp and buy a new one for home.While searching on the internet for the best price, I learned about the Nano and really struggled with buying it, mainly because of the price. I liked my Chi Turbo but didn't want to wear out another switch. I also had heard that the quality of Chi products had gone down hill and saw a DRASTIC difference in pricing, so I called my local beauty supply shop. What I learned was that genuine Chi products are made in the US ONLY! If you find a Chi hairdryer for $50, its more than likely a knock off. If you're buying online, and it's coming from anywhere outside the US, its also likely a knock off!Long story short, this is the BEST hairdryer I have ever owned. It drys fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny, with no frizz, I don't even need to flat iron if I take the time to blow it out right with a large brush!My opinion, if you're having trouble with your Chi, and you didn't buy it at your salon or local beauty supply store (or other reputable retailer), it's probably not a genuine Chi. You can't buy a $150 hairdryer for $50 and expect it to be great.GREAT features: the cold shot switch stays on, don't have to hold it, this is great for setting your hair; its is by far the lightest hairdryer I've ever found, and the stand is very functional."
198278,1,"I bought this for my for mothers day I think. She said that she love it and she uses it everyday, It stay really hot and its really smooth. Chi's like this are usually over $100 easy! I couldn't believe the price on it when I saw this. Very good purchase, one of my best."

135462,0,"This Bath pillow was much smaller than I expected. The suction cups on the back can't all hold at the same time, because the tops ones let go when you get the bottom ones to hold."
221696,0,The powder is wonderful. I have been unable to find it in stores so went looking for it on-line. I was very pleased to find it at a reasonable price. The picture is misleading. I thought I was ordering the powder in the container. The product shipped was the white powder refill without the container.
134441,1,"This cream really works great. It is the only thing I have ever tried that keeps my hands and feet from cracking. They are softer than ever before. The fragrance smells great, but I do wish I could find it fragrance free, because my daughter cannot use creams with fragrance and I prefer not to."
242890,2,"I finally bought this product and was very excited to try it. It had wonderful online reviews, and a few of my friends swear by it. The first 2 weeks were decent, I did not get the usual huge under the skin pimples that I get at a certain time of the month, but I did have a few tiny pimples. Currently, my skin is the worst it has ever been. After those first two weeks my skin went CRAZY and I have a TON of whiteheads and painful under the skin pimples. I can't believe my skin broke out this badly. I tried it for one month to be sure it wasn't just a transitioning phase with the small breakouts... and now I have a large bottle with a ton left in it that I will just have to give away!"
185387,1,"OK first of all, it's tanning oil, not tanning lotion, so naturally it's going to be oily! Secondly, it's less than $10USD at any Walmart or CVS or RiteAid type place I've ever been in, so of course it's not going to be some miracle tan product! For the money, it smells good, moisturizes decently for when you're laying out in the sun (NEVER use this in a tanning bed by the way!), the spray bottle lets you control your coverage, and it even comes in an SPF 4 or 8 version so you have *some* sun protection. All in all, it's a good product for the price."
17433,1,"I have difficult to style hair, to say the least, so there's no way I can leave the house on any given day without using some kind of product to tame it. When I've gone out of my way to make the extra effort to curl or straighten my hair on humid days I need something a little extra to keep my flyaways in place. I've tried several different brands of salon hairsprays, but living on a budget has eliminated those as an option. I'd had previous good luck with Tresemme's Heat Tamer spray and their Ultra Shine mist, so I thought I'd give them another shot.I picked this giant aerosol can of hairspray for $4, which was the first thing that made me happy. Although Tresemme has several different offerings in the hairspray department, I picked the Ultra Fine Mist because of it's claim of flexible hold. I liked the idea that my hair wouldn't look wet or crunchy and that there would still be some movement in it. And I'm pleased to say that this spray does exactly what the can claims it does. The mist is fine and the hold is strong while still being flexible. It tames what I need it to without looking like I have a ton of product in my hair. This is the first drug store hairspray I've found that does just as good a job as the salon brands at a third the price.However!There is one fairly significant downfall. The smell.This stuff smells absolutely AWFUL. Just terrible. It's a pungent kind of musky scent. I was surprised since Tresemme's other products always had a nice light fragrance about them, but something in the chemical makeup of this spray is different. So when you first spray and style, you're going to smell off-putting. The flip-side of that is that the scent fades to nothing fairly quickly (in less than 10 minutes), so as long as you can bear it for a little while, the odor can be gone by the time you leave the house. People with allergies or sensitive noses, however, might not be willing to put up with that.I love this and until I find something with a better (or non-existent!) fragrance, I'll keep rebuying this,"
116247,1,"I discovered the Bigen hair color powder in Mexico some years ago and keep using it. I know that it's not the safier product in the world because even though looking like natural, it does contain some chemicals.But from far, the quality of the color is the best : never fades, never turns yellowish or other tone under a sun exposure. If my hair was not growing so fast, I could use it only every 2 months but in fact I hold it during 5 weeks. As a conclusion, the ""least worse"" powder on the market..."
70038,2,"If you are looking for cuticle scissors, look elsewhere. The blades of these are way too thick to be able to cut cuticles. In fact, it is very difficult to even cut your nails with them! I am not sure who designed these, but they are terrible. Do not waste your money. All cuticle scissors are not created equal."

27845,1,"I was having some pain in my left foot, and had developed a hammer toe. A friend suggested I try a toe flexor. After a couple of weeks of wearing the toe flexor for 15 or 20 minutes a day, my foot pain is gone. The toe flexer was a wonderful, easy, and inexpensive solution."

23963,0,item cam fast and the bottle was much larger than I expected. I feel that this does not actually clean my face so I sometimes have to use a mild cleanser before using this. It worked well enough but nothing spectacular. I have since stopped using it and moved on to something that works better for me. However as far as glycolic cleansers go this one was good and comes in a large bottle.
32837,2,They are uncomfortable to wear and just not for me. I was not able to wear them as long as it says I needed to do so for results. Perhaps others will have better luck.
245906,0,"This conditioner smells great, but can't say much for its conditioning properties. Other, less expensive conditioners, have done as well or better."
210457,0,Fun to play with but horrible taste! Just concentrate on the fun with the paints.
81575,1,I agree with the comments above. I have tried a few different ones--I bought a self tanning spray for $30.00. I'm not very impressed by that one. I really like the Banana Boat E.D.G. SunDial tanner--I will buy this one again--for sure!!
66859,0,"The Shampoo had less of a citrus scent than this. This conditioner gave me a headache sometimes while showering because of the strong citrus scent. I seldom use this. Get the shampoo, skip the conditioner."
246025,0,This product is ok as it keep my face moist and smells great but it also left my face a little irritated.
67524,0,"I have very fine, medium length hair. I can't tell the Samy Mucho Volume Mousse gives me more volume than any other mousses I've tried. My results were about the same as when I use cheaper discount store mousses. My hair does look a little shinier though. I noticed the bottle says ""New Fragrance/New Package."" It's a very distinctive fragrance, so you'll probably either really like it or not care for it at all. It reminds me of Orange Crush soda, but I'm not in love with the scent. I'll finish this can, but I wouldn't make a point to buy it again."
191741,1,as the tittle says this is the best acne wash in the mkt!!!but should be a little less expensive
103231,2,"this thing is so old school i'm surprised the instructions don't say to heat it on an open flame with your ""supper,"" a la little house on the prairie!! it takes FOREVER to heat up, and only the tiny crimpy attachment works. i sold this a couple of months ago at our garage sale, the lady wouldnt give me TWO bucks for it! when you check the wattage/voltage on this compared to my current flat iron (Revlon 20 dollar cheapie from target) it is like, then times less power. dont waste your time AND/OR money on this studebaker of hair accesories!"
136890,2,"This item is ramped up to be so awesome!! However, this can't even steam in a curl that will last longer than 10 seconds, take the roller out and instantly...flat hair!! Very disapointing!"

240004,0,"I have chin-length fine, straight hair. My mother, rest her soul, must be laughing loud and long at the idea of moi, who only ever wanted curly hair, using a straightener. However, it turns out that fine, straight hair is actually acceptable as long as it is smooth. Who knew? So I've been using a straightener for about a year now. My previous straightener is also a Remington, with plain ceramic plates. I've been pretty pleased with it -- my only quibble has been that I have occasionally accidentally turned it off while styling, and have occasionally been unable to turn it off using the ""on/off"" button and had to unplug it.I was eager to try this straightener because of the ""50% less damage""-causing teflon fiber plates. I also kinda hoped they'd fixed the button problem. Bottom line -- the fiber plate is a bit odd. It gives more ""traction"" and so hair, at least fine, straight hair, doesn't slide through as quickly. I think it will be some time before any evaluation of 'less damage' can be made, although damage wasn't a big problem with my previous straightener. And the buttons are a disaster.On my old straightener, the ""temperature up"" and ""temperature down"" buttons were on the hinge side of the display. On this model, they are smaller and on the open side of the display and basically, at least for me, act as grippy little divots into which my fingers naturally fall as I style. And this causes the unit to change temperature, which I could stand, if it didn't beep. But it beeps when the temperature changes. Having to fix one's hair in the morning is bad enough without the stress of knowing you are randomly changing the temperature of your straightening iron, and it is beeping at you about it. Aaaagggghhhhh! It is possible to lock the temperature (although one does so by pressing and holding the ""minus"" key, not by the method given in the printed directions), but you then have to unlock it to turn the appliance off. Aaaaaggghhhhh!In summary:Pro* Fabric plate provides more ""traction"" which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage* Unit heats up quickly* There is a hinge lock so unit is easier to transport* Dual voltage for international travelCon* Temperature set buttons are impossible to avoid while styling* Locking the buttons is a time-consuming on and off process that has to be done each time you use the straightener* Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one's hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)* Unit communicates with annoying beepsTo me, what would make sense, is a straightener whose temperature I can set once and then lock and each time I turn the thing on, it goes to that temperature. Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much? The on/off button would be on the hinge side of the display and so would be hard to press while styling, and the display would change to something like ""READY"" when temperature is reached. As things stand, I'm going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!"
173571,0,This lipstick is very creamy and rich. I like the texture but the red is a little too bright. When I wear the lipstick I use a gloss over it and that sort of tones it down.
210642,0,"kinda flowery, thought it was more like cool water, its okey but not what I thoughtits okay but not what I expected, thought it would smell more like coolwater, since its blue, but its more flowery, tolerable"
89080,1,"Okay - I usually struggle with properly describing a scent and I collect perfumes:-)...but I think this one smells like a cross of Ysatsis and Chanel No. 5. I don't know from woody, spicy, etc...but it's truly fabulous!"
76215,1,"You can read my review of the Mychelle Clear Skin Serum. Mychelle Vitamin C Serum works great, I don't think the rest of the Mychelle oily/acne products work as well in clearing up skin as it does when it's coupled with Vitamin C Serum. After a month of using this serum from a sample pack I bought (Oily/Acne), my skin cleared up for the first time in YEARS!!!!!! When I ran out of the expensive serum, I started to get zits again but not as bad as before. After a few months I finally had money to buy it and my skin immediately started to clear again. I love Mychelle products, if you have oily/acne skin,Vitamin C serum is a MUST!!!!!!!! Mychelle products are great because they are not full of chemicals. I just wish that it was less expensive. Amazon seems to have a good price compared to retail."
128031,1,"This is the best perfume...ever!!! And I don't just say that because my name is Tatiana (I was named after this perfume). I love the scent of Tatiana and always mourn the end of a bottle. It's my personal trademark so I can't leave the house without it, and I love the compliments it gets me.I haven't tried the blush or eyeshadow yet, but if they are anything like the perfume I'm sure I'll love them.Anyway, hope this perfume makes you as happy as it always does me! And thanks Amazon, I've been looking everywhere for this perfume! Nobody local is selling it. This was perfect!"

31898,0,It lasts for an hour or so and will rub off. It also stains your lips in a bad way. Beautiful color though.
79064,0,"I really like the scent of this soap. It is woodsy/green and very refreshing. It's quite expensive, but it's a large container and reminds me of a past trip to Paris, so I'm willing to put up with the cost. My problem is the bottle. It's difficult to undo the cap every time you want to wash your hands. When it starts running low, it takes forever to get any soap. I've been placing it upside down (since the top of the lid is flat), but then when I turn it upright and undo the cap, gobs of it come out all over the place. Of course, if you have your own soap dispenser to pour this into, none of this will be a problem."
15116,2,"Smells like a old woman's perfume! The worst Creed ever, too strong and repulsive. Three people told me they couldn't handle the smell of this!"
218335,2,"This is one of the most disappointing products I have ever tried. Who ever is marketing this junk is doing an excellent job, you fooled me. This stuff is purely for people with overly processed hair. You hair has to be super damaged for this to work and even then it maybe questionable. It makes your unprocessed, healthy parts of your hair (roots) very greasy and weighed down while leaving a filmy residue on the processed hair. It gives the effect of your hair not looking washed for days. I can't bring myself to use this stuff again in fear of another embarrassing and uncomfortable day at work. A pure waste of money!"
141101,0,"I also did not find this to be strongly scented and having read the previous reviews, was a little disappointed with the product. It does smell good, but not as strongly as I had hoped, and cleans very well. I find it a little drying, however, and had I known, would have purchased a different product. They do include samples of some of their other products and having used those, found the shampoo, conditioner, body wash combo to be better for my skin and hair. Will I purchase a philosophy product for myself again? Maybe. Will I be happy to recieve it as a gift? Absolutely."
19870,1,"My first use of this product was today. Lastnight I took a shower and put on a dime size amount, focused on my ends and top layer. This morning, super soft!! Applied and tiny tiny amount to the ends that always seem to fry when I flat iron. Flat ironed it all and I have NO fried ends and my hair is super soft and silky. I have fairly course and natural wave, that looks frizzy without some produc on it. I MUST say I LOVE this stuff. I could see where using too much would cause an oily look and weigh it down, so go light at first. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!"
106328,2,"I saw this selection of men's cologne from Lalique and thought they would make a nice gift for my nephew. I admit to a certain innocence regarding the brand as I thought that the bottles would be Lalique (I should have realized from the price that it would be unlikely). When they arrived, I could smell the cologne through the packaging, so I opened it up to see if a bottle broke. Indeed, one bottle had leaked. Even more disconcerting, though, were the bottles themselves. The decorative tops are a cheap, molded plastic. The leaking, cheap bottles simply could not be used as a gift. I have to say, though, that Amazon was wonderful when I contacted them about my disappointment."

230962,1,"...for this great wall-unit hair dryer. 9 years ago we bought 3 of these units (one for each bath room) and we are just now having to replace the first one. We ordered 3 more because the remaining two of the orignal units MAY finally quit, although they seem to be doing just fine. At any rate, great service and a very economical price considering the logevity of the units with proper care and cleaning of the filter.We definitely recommend these units."
78155,0,"This product was recommended to me, as I have very painfully chapped lips in the winter. I've been using lanolin on them, and with how pricy this product is, had hoped it'd be a miracle.

I took a small dollop of this product, applied it, and almost instantly, my hair curled and 30 minutes of hard work was completely ruined! I suppose it works well with your natural hair type, so if you like your hair type there won't be any problems; however, if you put hard work into curling or straightening your hair, this product is likely to ruin everything you work for, so I do NOT recommend it."

107016,1,"I only have this because I was getting the set with vanilla and cotton candy. If it floats your boat, more power to you, but I'm a HIGHLY vanilla-y kind of person, and I love cotton candy scents as well.But I don't feel as if I wasted money getting the set with white musk ( I wanted to get stuff purse-sized) because if I needed air freshner, it does the job to kill odors. So, for that reason, I give it a five."
85904,0,"I tried this product on my daughter, who's 23 months old. She has the habit of sucking her fingers to go to sleep since she was a few months old. It works the very first night. I tried it myself. It is very bitter and lingers in my mouth for a long time.I continue to apply the product to my daughter's fingers for about a week when I started noticing that my daughter's finger started showing redness and became harden with small bumps. I have stopped applying the product immediately. After a trip to the doctor's office, it seems my daughter has an allergic reaction to the product that applying 1% hydrocrotizine might help. We've done the hydrocrotizine regimen for two days now, it seems to have lessened the overall effect.This just a word of caution that some people might develope an reaction to this otherwise wonderful product."
42167,1,"I was given a tube of Pre de Provence lavender shea butter hand cream as a gift, and loved it so much that I made it last a couple of years, as I had no idea where I'd ever get more. Just a tiny bit -- about 1/4 inch out of the tube -- is enough to moisturize your hands, and the lavender fragrance is sharp and true and lingers. I am a potter, and use this sort of thing often to keep my hands from drying up and cracking. Just on a hunch, I checked Amazon to see if this wonderful stuff might be available through them, and much to my joy it is! I am not only getting myself some more, but buying a few extra tubes as gifts for my lavender-loving friends."

I wasn't intending to write up a review of it, but I was searching for a new dryer and came across this product, and then I got mad all over again!It shuts off all the time. You don't even finish drying one small strip of damp hair before bam! it's off. I thought it was overheating, but so quickly? No, it's just a junky product, because this ""overheating"" bit starts almost right away. I was vigiliant that the brush stayed clean. It's easy to remove the barrel for maintenance.I bought mine at Walmart (or Target, can't remember which), and went through two of them before I finally got it through my thick-head that it doesn't work. I love this type of product, but I am now on Amazon looking for a different brand and hoping for something that will last longer than this junk did."

Sadly, the heating element went out on it this morning. As many other reviewers have said, I'd expect this dryer to work for much longer for the cost. I will say that the dryer was pretty quiet and did a great job drying my fine, straight hair. However, my cheap hair dryer that I got back in high school STILL works. The quality of this hair dryer apparently needs to be improved."

I would not say this didn't work, because I didn't use it long enough. I just hated the scent."

This stuff smells so light. and it does not last! I spray it on and it only lasts 10 min, then its gone. I'm very disappointed. This must either be a fake or a oversea import. I assume I cannot return it since I have used it once already. If the seller lets me return this, I will give a better comment. but right now, I'm am not a happy customer, definitely feel cheated."
163665,0,"I have 90% gray, have had it since I was 18, so I color my hair and roots frequently. I liked the idea of an herbal color and thought I would give this a try. The color was good, but I had to recolor with a traditional, loaded with chemicals brand within 2 wks. This is great in theory and maybe if you have less gray it would work great, but for me a miss."
207140,0,Its difficult to find a product that reduces rosacea and doesn't harm your skin or is too harsh. This product is a wonderful face wash. It is great at calming my skin and preventing outbreaks of bumps and redness.
119666,2,I was excited to purchase this product because it was so inexspensive! I recieved it and was disappointed because you have to have your face in it with a towel over your head and it gets old. You can boil water and have the same effect.
149939,0,"This is very mild and smells exactly like coconut! I wish it ended up being as strong smelling as the other reviews led me to believe...but its not. Still a good product though, hard to mess up mineral oil LOL!"

217315,2,"I was hesitant to purchase lipstick without actually seeing it first but, went ahead anyway. I was happy when the package arrived however, when I opened the package I saw a small, dirty box. Inside was the lipstick, very true to color when I removed the top and looked but, at the same time it had a stale, rancid smell which immediately indicated to me that this product had probably been sitting on a shelf for some time.If I'm going to pay over $10 for a lipstick, it better be new and smell fresh. BEWARE."
227686,0,"Overall, Coriandre is an easy-to-wear chypre (really?) that is as season-less & classic as a lightweight gabardine suit. The opening is crisp, clean & clear. The coriander note is subtle to me, not spicy, and I have no problems with wear. As it goes into the heart, I am picking up a bit a soapiness & barely-there soft florals. Dries down to a dry moss & vetiver scent, yet it's quite feminine to me.Coriandre is a soapy woody on me that's not very long-lasting. I've heard so much about the rose in Coriandre, but it's nothing to write home about in the formulation that I'm testing. In fact, I purposely picked up the 33ml frosted cylindrical bottle based reports that it was close to the original rose chypre formulation. Sadly, it's not.This Coriandre might be a good choice if you're tired of big floral scents and overtly sweet ones. However, I wasn't looking for a soapy woody floral, and there are no redeeming qualities in this fragrance that would encourage me to give it shelf space."
209222,0,one of the better and less harsher dyes out there. you may still exhibit some allergic reactions but they will be milder w/this product.
25356,1,"I bought EARLY TAN in Normal/Combination Skin formula and I can tell you that it provides good coverage but not without being weighty and heavy. Some people like that. I find I can only wear it during the winter. (During the summer it makes my skin break out)I haven't noticed any moisturizing feature, although it's heavy enough that it provides some protection against the harsh winds of winter.It's a good product if you like heavier coverage.Pam T~"
201709,0,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
32069,2,I purchased RoC Retinol Correxion night Cream and it irritated my eyes and mademy skin burn. I couldn't use it and the Amazon dealer refused my request for arefund. Very disappointing.
180503,2,never buy in website.For the first time I tried in website and it turned out be worst product that I have ever bought.
210552,1,My Husband LOVES curve....and we normally pay a lot more for it! I was thrilled to find his fav at a great price!
48599,0,"I have an extremely dry scalp, and it helps! It smells slightly like kerosene, but is a good shampoo. The stink dissipates."
169329,0,"This dye is meant to be used on light or bleached hair. so if your hair is black, it will not stay.Anyway, I did bleach my hair before using this, and it's ok. It faded sooner than the usual brand of hair dye that I use, which I ended up mixing it with for the next application. I won't be buying it again, though. it also kind of smells weird, for a dye that doesn't have bleach in it."
10339,2,"I own this product and it was working great, a little greasy if you sprayed too much, but after a month of having it, it has clogged and nothing comes out. I tried pulling off the top and rinsing it out and cleaning the tube but nothing worked. What a waste."
186949,2,"This eyeliner is suppose to be wine, but its really blue.. Thats what is difficult about buying make up online.. It would be great if seller had a better description about product, or maybe a swatch of the color..The pencil is nice quality, but wasnt color i was looking for, butI will not purchase again from this seller"
196664,2,JUST A HEADS UP TO EVERYONE ON FAROUK CHI. THEY WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY IF YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS FROM A LICENSED BEAUTY SALON. I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY!
101805,0,"I've been using Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment for 3 weeks now and sadly I have to say that my $5.00 drug store stuff works better. I followed directions completely and it just doesn't do the trick for me. It also has a very strange odor that does go away after a while, but it is hard to get used to. Maybe this works better on some skin types than others, but it just isn't for me."
8060,2,This soap listed as regularly selling for the list price of $125.00 which is also represented as weighing 60lbs and as a 72 bar case is really just O-N-E bar of soap. They sold it to me for $6 and then reduced the price after my call a few minutes ago. The TNT customer service acknowledged this listing is a misrepresentation of what they are selling but refused to fulfill the order after sending me just O-N-E bar of soap. Funny that they changed the price but not the all the other purposeful misrepresentation.
63388,2,"It is very easy to apply. If you are looking for a good peach shade, this is not it; ""Just Peachy"" is a light pasty-looking peach that when applied to the back of the hand shows up in the pores and that is not what a cream blush should do......plus it looks garish. I threw it right in the trash. But if you like that light, bright, pasty-looking peach shade that looks like clown paint, then go for it. I also didn't care for Revlon's Photo Ready blush in the ""Pinched"" shade for the same reasons."
92959,0,"I had no problems with red highlights at least initially. After a few days my hair started to get redder so obviously if you use this you need Sally Beauty's No Red to add in. The smell is pleasant and goes on well, but it doesn't cover grey very well so the ultimate colour is much lighter than what is shown on the box probably a dark blonde instead of a light warm brown."
130052,0,"This worked to lessen my scars, but did not get rid of the larger ones. I think this is a good product, but very expensive!"
112834,2,"the straw broke while trying to wash it, that was before I even got a chance to try it. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would."
6259,1,I ordered it for my wife and she liked it. Its handy and easy to use.
166472,0,"I enjoyed this fragrance myself but perhaps I applied a bit too much by accident. It has been the only fragrance I've received multiple complaints about at the office, people literally running away, saying ""I'm allergic!"" very embarassing, as you might guess.Beware, it is loud, but that could be good, as a small bottle should be a 10 year supply."
55957,2,"Although Amazon indicated this supplier had the product, after the product was ordered, I received notice from the supplier that they are out of the product. However, the supplier managed to send me another item and charged me for shipping of a product I did not want without the product out of supply. I am very disappointed with this vendor."
208855,1,"While I like the whole philosophy skin care line, this is the one product that absolutely blew me away. It's a combination exfoliating scrub and peel that takes off all the dull, dead skin that I didn't even know I had. But when I rinsed it off, the smoothness of my skin and the glow just amazed me. It's a very visible difference - and it lasts for a good couple of days.When you use the exfoliating scrub, just don't scrub too enthusiastically. You're supposed to rub it *around* not rub it *in.* Start gently and you'll get a feeling for how much you need to rub. Then when you add the activator, be prepared for it to foam and get warm - I LOOOOVE that part! I just wish it stayed warm. I leave it on 5 minutes - the longest time recommended and then, before I rinse it off, I do one last quick scrub to loosen up any dead skin that the activator may have worked on.I do this peel every weekend and it's something I look forward to - and what's more fun is that people are commenting on how beautiful my skin looks - and when you're 50 years old, that's a really nice thing to hear."
157474,1,"i bought this hand cream from amazon. i was most pleased with the hand cream. a friend had given me a sample size to try several months ago . my friend is from idaho and i am from florida. we all met at a dog show in texas. i loved the product. but coul;dn't find it anywhere in west palm beach, fl.now that i finally have my jasmine juice i find that i do not like the pump. it takes several pumpings to get the cream (juice) up and out of the bottle. the product is very thick and feels wonderful on my skin. i feel it is a design fault that the pump is not easier to use.i received another pump when i previously complained about the pump. the replacement pump is the same as the original. made no difference.a real co-incidence occured with my friend in idaho and me in florida. we originally met in texas in MARCH. after trying to find the hand cream locally i also tried on line and couldn't find it. i sort of gave up when someone said try amazon. i did and lo and behold you had it. ordered it, received it . i e mailed my friend in idaho to tell her i finally found the jasmine juice. she replied to me that i would soon have 2 bottles since she just found it on drugstore.com . at least $2 cheaper than amazon!!!"
19911,2,"This item is fake. It looks like someone took real biosilk therapy and added 3/4 of alcohol. We know that ethanol actually dries hair so I wouldn't recommend using it. I just bough real stuff in the store and it's like it should be - thick and smelling of roses with no ethanol.The original company making the product warns again counterfeits, and this is one of those.Don't buy it!"
170404,0,"I love OPI and have been using it for years. I was on the hunt for the perfect mint green shade for summer and came across this one. I've never used China Glaze before, but see it in salons so thought it has to be decent. It is a very cool color and I love it, but it doesn't last long at all and I will never buy another China Glaze polish. It chips after only a day...very disappointing. Doesn't hold up near as long as OPI."
9120,1,So do I! ;-) Very nice scent. Can't recommend this perfume enough. Thanks Chistian for such an amazing Eau de Parfum!
91688,2,"I bought this after seeing great reviews of it on YouTube. I am sorry, but it does not smell beachy at all. There is no coconut smell or other summer scents. What I do smell is aftershave cologne. It smells just like a man.I don't want to smell like a guy."
246177,1,Item was just as it was stated in the for sale add.It was shipped & arrived on time.
1358,0,Although this lipgloss does moisture the lips and gives beautiful shine it is very greasy and very sticky. Don't buy it if you don't like sticky lip glosses!
223377,0,"The scent is not terrible, but it's not great. It doesn't last very long either. I wouldn't purchase it again."
31613,0,"I don't dislike this scent by any means - it's perfectly nice. A clean, fresh scent that is particularly well-suited for the summer months. The citrus notes are heavy and dominant. I can't imagine many would find this scent overpowering or offensive (which is nice is a day-to-day wear scent), but for me it's too generic a smell. Since I don't wear it on my body often, I sometimes spray it to freshen up a room and I personally find it better for that than to wear as a cologne. Keeping in mind that scents are hugely personal, for me L'Eau Par Kenzo Men is simply too conservative for my tastes. Furthermore, it simply doesn't last long on me at all. I find the scent to be very fleeting, which perhaps is not surprising given that it's less expensive than many other colognes. I find it to be a pleasant smell but unremarkable and perhaps worse, unmemorable. It's not a bottle I'd personally own again, but I think for the right person this could be a nice scent."
87406,2,"I bought the giant size of this nearly two years ago, it does last a long time! My hair is colored and highlighted and I wash it 2-3 times a week. A couple of months ago it occurred to me that my bathroom counter is crowded with about 6 or 7 different leave in conditioners and several hair masks. I don't know if it is the shampoo or the matching conditioner that I have used along with it but these products are very drying. That said, I think they do preserve the color and it's nice they are not tested on animals, which is a must for any product I use. When my hair dresser pointed out my hair was breaking off I had to switch."
250028,1,"Great smell, great consistency. Leaves my hair feeling really smooth and hydrated without being at all greasy. I think you're supposed to leave it in, but I've always washed it out for great results."
132024,2,A friend suggested this product since I have curly hair so I thought why not it may do something different 2 help my curls out. This product in my opinion is WAY OVER PRICES $ 23-25 a bottle !!!! Did not improve my curl texture/hold that my PANTENE CURLY GEL DOES & alot cheaper. The shipper for this product was great though no problems with them. I would buy from them again just not Mixed Chicks.
203972,1,"It came on easily and lasted a long time, but was smaller than I expected it to be."
234590,0,I don't like the icky residue on my hair when it's applied twice a day - and waiting for hair to dry before applying styling products is a bit of a pain. Jury is still out on this one.
94840,2,"Okay, I have to say this is the wierdest scent I've ever come across. It's a very dark woodsy smell that gives you chill when you breath it in. It's cold... there's no warm to it at all. There is a hint of Jamine maybe but that's counter acted by an intense bitter root afterglow. After wearing it for a couple of hours I'm not happy to report that I actually became nauseated. I really tried to embrace the diversity of this scent, give it a shot and not judge it to harshly but unfortunately my physical reaction won out. Go ahead and try it if you enjoy unatural unearthly scents. My recommendation is to get a sample first of course, but I have to warn you; It just may jump start a vomit!"
63744,0,"I wanted to love this stuff, I really did, but it's just not living up to it's hype. I bought the natural coconut, because I love the smell of coconut and didn't want any other scents added. The smell is okay, but a bit too sweet and heavy for my taste, not as light as I had hoped. Also, I'm not terribly impressed with it's skin softening abilities either...again, it's okay, but nothing extraordinary. It does soak right in, and leaves absolutely no oily residue. I haven't used it on my hair yet, so the verdict is still out on that. All in all I'd have to say it's been fairly mediocre and under-whelming so far."
9556,2,"Dove has traditionally been known for gentle products, but this shampoo caused major allergy problems for both myself and my daughter. This shampoo has a VERY strong odor, which caused intense nasal congestion for both of us within seconds after applying the shampoo. Furthermore, my daughter's cheeks became red and swollen about an hour after using the shampoo. She was still sneezing 2 hours after using the shampoo, and she finally felt better after we washed her hair (with another shampoo) and gave her Benadryl. My daughter's 11, and this is the first time she's ever had an allergic reaction to a fragrance. The smell also gives me a headache, so I have to keep my distance from other family members who use it.That said, not everyone in my family has problems with the smell (which is otherwise pleasant). However, I would be wary of purchasing this product if you are sensitive to strong fragrances or have sensitive skin."
37031,0,I previously had my Bed Head curling iron and I must admit that I liked it a lot more than this Infinity one. It kind of feels cheap and temperature control buttons always get on the way :( . The black point on top is not long enough so I have burned myself a couple of times already so you should be carefull. Other than all these minuses to the product it's not so bad to create curls. I actually like the end result a lot :). So if you don't mind the design of the product but care for the way your hair comes out more than definitely buy it !
98729,0,"This is a great brush but it's huge and a bit heavy. Works very well but a little too big and unwieldy. I ended up buying a smaller 2 1/2 inch diameter brush to use instead. If you have long curly hair that you want to dry straight then this brush is for you. Otherwise, it's just a little too big and heavy to use all the time."
166991,2,"I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, FROM ANOTHER SELLER.EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A 2017 DATE, ON WRAPPER,WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN EXPIRATION DATE,THIS BAR OF SOAP, USED FOR THE FIRST TIME, HAD NO SUDSING ACTION, & MINIMAL FRAGRANCE,UNLIKE PAST PRODUCT USAGE."
161919,0,"This model replaces an earlier one that put out a lot of heat, but the replacement one, while seemingly appearing to have been upgraded, does not put out the level of heat as the one I replaced after several years of use. That one ""died."" Also, the digital clock is not included in the replacement model. That was a feature much appreciated so without it I feel a bit more of disapointment. However, the replacement model does look ""smart"" mounted on the bathroom wall."
64974,1,I have used this products only a few times because it takes some practice to figure out how to roll the hair without getting creases in your hair. It seems look fine when it's rolled until I take the rollers out and there are lines in my hair where the cover has left a crease. The curl is extreme so figuring out which sizes work for the look you are after takes a few tries. I like loose curls so I used the largest rollers all over my head. I had to purchase an extra set of rollers because the kit doesn't come with very many. With practice you can get some amazing curls!
119215,0,"Yes, it is far reaching. But the bristles are rather short and not very stiff. Great for a woman, but not for a guy who likes a good strong scrub."
184867,0,"I have replaced the filter in this system a few times before with no problem. This time, it leaked like crazy until we realized that the O ring on the shower head had come off with the old filter.....had to get the old filter out of the trash and remove the O ring from it which was tricky to get back in the right place on the shower head and make it stay. After that, it was fine, but I'm wondering if you have to buy the whole unit again to avoid this problem."
251815,2,"Very disappointed. I try to avoid plastic as much as possible. This was supposed to come with an organic cotton baby t-shirt, but instead it came with a ""recycled"" reusable polyester (plastic) type bag. Not interested. Detracted from the rest of the products in the box."
68665,2,"I purchased this conditioner after doing some searching for good products for color treated hair. This product with the shampoo had some of the best reviews, and responses. I did not go out and smell this somewhere else, so I went based strictly off the reviews. I will say that I love the way the shampoo smells. It has an almond scent combined with something else I can't quite put my finger on. It isn't overly powerful, just something light.The conditioner has a completely different scent. When I first applied it I really thought of flea and tick shampoo. I am not sure that it has that scent, but it definitely makes me think of times when I have bathed my dog. I have seen other promising reviews, so maybe my chemistry does not mix with it. I have tried mixing up the conditioner, and I've used it a couple times hoping that it was just a fluke, sadly that hasn't been the case. When I use this product I am left smelling like a wet poodle. I've never had this happen with any other product.As far as the product conditioning properties, it has not provided any of the softness that I saw others post about. My hair is thick, and I do need conditioner as part of my regime. The only thing that I can think of with this particular product that was promising for me was that it is sulfate and dea free. While those are important factors for me, it is not enough for me to continue using this product."
185429,0,I like the spicey fragrance it was probably my third favorite out of them all would probably use this one again.
173269,0,when i bought this movie i thought it would play in my dvd player and it did not luckily it only plays on my computer but would rather watch from the comfort of my couch.
169492,2,I like the liquid Grecian even though it smells alittle bad. This foam producat to me has a very strong stinky smell that gave me a migraine headache all night. I threw it in the trash and then ordered more of the liquid Grecian which I do like.
111417,0,"This stuff is just barely better than any random gel you'd get at your local drugstore. If you want a good shave, get a real badger hair brush and a shave cream like Musgo or Proraso. This stuff is too liquidy and doesn't stay on the skin, I don't understand why everyone seems to think it's so good. Go try a real shave cream, you will not be disappointed."
137401,0,This nail polish is very thin and goes on extremely sheer. You need at least 4 coats to make it opaque and to get the color you want.
178613,1,"Love this shampoo, I HOPE THEY DON'T STOP MAKING IT. I can only find it online and now Amazon can't find it either. PLEASE bring it back"
58156,0,"I rated this as ok. It's great to put on if you want a slight hint of pink, or use it over another polish to give it a sheen.I do not like that it doesn't last long. I go to work out in the pool at our local wellness center and find this polish does not hold up. Guess it's the bromine they use in this pool for disinfectant."
123594,2,* John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Perfecting Spray did not do anything for my curls* I will have to try something else that might work better* I liked the Beyond Zone or the Got2B Smooth Operator to make my curls soft and managable
120315,0,"I recently purchased this gel after giving birth to my 3rd child. I had high hopes for this product, but didn't really notice much of a difference. I did not use the postpartum gel after my first two children. I used it 1x everyday for the first month and then 1x every other day for the second month following delivery. One bonus -- it did help remove the itchiness from where the skin was stretched (better than moisturizer)."
80296,0,"My girlfriend told me about how awesome this product was and how it made her darker than any other lotion she has ever used. I do not think the same, I don't find it any better or worse. I do have a couple qualms with it. The first is the cap and dispensing. The cap opens like a water bottle. I would expect one of the caps that has a little hole in it. I wind up using more product than I need. It also has a slight self tanner smell.I bought two bottles at my girlfriends recommendation but probably would not again in the future. The seller was great though."
63733,0,"I usually like products from this company, however this cream cleanser leaves a film on my skin that i didnt particularly like. I have sensitive/combination skin and this cleanser made me break out. I would not recommend this to anyone with acne or combination skin. This is better suit for people with very dry skin or for people during the winter."
10501,1,"I guess I misread the description, thought I was getting a set of two different sized brushes, I only got one. I do love it though."
186276,0,"I won't be buying this again, only because it is so expensive! But if the price were lower, I'd use it again -- it's a nice lotion with a subtle smell that didn't irritate my skin."
194692,0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
237075,1,"Good product, but it came two days later than expected and it was a christmas product. So my complaint is with the shipping."
158450,1,"I bought this product during the worst breakout of my life. Day 1, my skin felt smoother. Day 2, still smooth, no other change. Day 3, HUGE improvement!! Redness GREATLY reduced, inflammation GONE. Day 6, perfect skin.This is the only skin product that I have religiously used, because it works so well. I wash my face with it every morning (and it's a great way to wake up because it feels really cold and refreshing). I also use it in the shower at night, on my face, neck, and chest. You will notice that your skin feels much smoother, and redness really does fade.Bottom line, you don't need the entire 49 step Murad line-- you just need this product. It really does work like a miracle."
179802,0,The site showed me a picture of a perfume bottle. It still smells pretty good though. Was trying to revisit fond memories of when I was younger.
82761,0,"On my skin, this reminds me of '80's pop sensation Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth. It's not bad, but it smells a little cheap and somebody didn't put a lot of effort into making this perfume. I think that I will stick to my Chanel Cuir de Russie and Frapin 1920."
35738,0,I purchased this item as a gift so I'm not too sure what the products are like!
234064,1,"This hair dryer works as advertised! It is quieter, lighter, and performs better than my old Revlon hair dryer. Although I was initially skeptical of the hype, this ""tourmaline / nano-ceramic"" hair dryer did indeed leave my hair shinier and smoother than my old ion hair dryer. It worked so well on my thick Asian hair that I felt like I'd walked out of a salon. My husband is happier because it doesn't wake him up in the morning.I also like that it uses a small plug for the wall outlet, so I no longer have to unplug my husband's electric razor to use it. Also, the concentrator attachment partially screws on so that it doesn't fall off every time I set the dryer down on the counter, like my old Revlon's attachment did. I also *love* the look of it; the red is bold and stylish. I honestly can't think of a single way to improve this hair dryer (other than to make a completely silent levitating one).So overall, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, would recommend it to my friends, etc. I'm actually considering buying a second one for my gym bag, even though my gym provides hairdryers in the locker rooms. It really works that much better."
171585,0,Smells good but iv smelled better. Definitely a unique smelling cologne but I don't think I'll buy it again. Just not for me. I suggest you buy a sample size bottle before you invest in a larger one.
17748,0,"This shampoo was thick and rich feeling and produced a nice lather in the shower. The drawback that I instantly noticed, though, was a very strong """"mediciney"""" type odor that lingered on my hair even after I dried it. On the plus side, it gave me lots of volume and body and really cleaned my scalp thoroughly. While I generally don't like Head & Shoulders because of its strong smell, I think it does an excellent job of cleaning hair and controlling dandruff."
22074,0,"I love the smell of tomato leaves, and I was hoping that this perfume would smell just like them. Answer-- not really. There's a little bit of an herbaceous, leafy sort of smell, but it's combined with kind of a generic floral scent. The smell is okay, I'm just disappointed that it's not what I was expecting."
157538,2,"I thought at least the redness or the bumps were gonna disappear but no 3 months later my arms look the same, I'm didn't use only the lotion moisturizing but the scrub and serum as well not even because I was using it daily, I'm seriously very sad about the results"
187972,2,"The on/off buttons are in the position shown on the pink/purple iron above, not on the close up of the black one. It is really easy to hit them with your fingers as you manipulate the iron and turn it of. Many new conairs have this issue. Shame - this one is going back."
52496,1,"I wanted to try out a different scent by Cartier. I think Le Baiser Du Dragon beats out Must, which I have always worn before. This scent is a bit lighter, but still has the deeper, richer, exotic notes that Cartier is so famous for. I love ""The Kiss of The Dragon!"" I ordered the miniature just to try it out, and now I will definitely get the larger bottle! This is an exceptional scent... you'll love it ; )"
48224,0,"I like the smell of this conditioner, though it can be over whelming if you use it on a daily basis. I have also noticed that every time I use this conditioner, my hair has a lot of static."
214425,0,i was fairly happy with this product - the color is very close to my natural lid color so it doesn't show as much as i had hoped but it still lends a pretty sparkle
84986,2,"This product contains two things, as stated on the package. Pills, and a cream.The creme contains a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide mixture, which is similar, if not exactly like, about 50% of all acne treatments. Acne treatments work using either a 2.5%, 5.0%, or 10% Benzoyl Peroxide mix, or, a Salicylic Acid mix. BP works by directly killing acne bacteria and increasing skin turnover rate, which means the pores get clogged less. Salicylic acid works by actively removing epidermis cells, which again decreases clogging of pores, as well as decreasing inflammation, since Acetylsalicylic acid is what we call Aspirin, and decreases pain and inflammation.Basically, either of those two ingredients work for scientific reasons. The cream included in the Natures Cure package contains an ingredient that works, period.The pills however, are pure insanity. Homeopathic medicine is probably the biggest medicinal fraud on Earth, even more so than magnetic bracelets or thinking that getting sick is caused by ""bad blood,"" as was thought hundreds of years ago.For those that don't know what it is, homeopathy states that to cure something, you have to introduce into the body something that produces similar ailments. If you have a headache, you should take something that gives you a headache. So they test things. Does taking arsenic give you a headache? It does? Then you'd better take some of that. Sound crazy? You don't know the half of it. Homeopathics think that in order for the like+like=cured effect to take place, the item must be diluted. This is what those ""12x"" and ""30x"" numbers mean. Here's how dilution works for them:If you take one part of an item, say...""Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower)"" as is in these pills, and mix it with 9 parts water, you will have Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower) 1x. Now take one part of that mixture and mix it with 9 parts water. This is 2x. At this point, there is 1 part of the original ingredient and 99 parts water. Do it again, 3x. And again, 4x. So on. We get to Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower) 12x, which is what these pills contain. If you know math, then you have already figured out that this is 1 part Cone Flower to 10,000,000,000,000 parts water. That's 10 trillion parts water.10 TRILLION parts water, 1 part cone flower. If they started with tablespoons, as in, 1 tablespoon cone flower and 9 tablespoons water, you would now have 1 tablespoon of cone flower in 39,062,500,000 gallons of water. This is almost as much water as the ENTIRE United States uses every day. Sprinklers, drinking water, toilets, everything across the country. If we took all that water and put a tablespoon of cone flower in it, how big of a difference would it make?Now here's the big thing. At around 23-26x, it is doubtful that your current ""1 part of the previous mix with 9 parts water concoction"" would contain even a single molecule from the original. Every time you mix again, you reduce that chance by 90%. Now look at the ingredients to the pills. ""Hepar Sulfuris Calcareum (calcium sulfide) 24x, Carbo Vegetabilis (vegetable carbon) 30x, Cimifuga racemosa (black cohosh) 30x, Graphites (graphite) 30x."" I would be willing to bet all the money I'd ever make in my life that these pills do not contain an ATOM of the ingredients listed here.Don't be fooled. Like one customer said, the pills tasted like nothing. Guess why?You can buy similar creams for $2. Homeopathic medicine is trash and this product is as well."
149584,2,My CHI model GF 1001 didn't even last one year! The plates are chipping and now I need to buy a new one. I wasn't aware that I bought a knock-off last year until I started searching for a new CHI and read the reviews. Very disappointed!
19160,0,"I didn't have any experience with loose powder prior to using Bare Escentuals, so some of my issues are not necessarily with Bare Escentuals per se, but with loose powder in general.First, I'm of the opinion that it's fairly messy, compared with liquid, cream, or pressed powder foundations. When I'm done putting Bare Escentuals foundation on, I usually find most of my fingertips as well as the inside of my sink to have a light dusting of it. I don't feel safe tossing the container into my makeup bag and taking it places with me; I don't trust the lid not to come off. I'm sure it's just my paranoia, but still. Some sort of thin rubber seal or lid that clicks when it's been closed all the way would have been sufficient to alleviate my unwarranted fears.Secondly, I feel like it neither offers enough coverage nor stays put well (I use a brush to apply it, then a finishing mineral powder on top). Granted, my foundation prior to it was a liquid, so I was probably spoilt in the two areas of coverage and staying power.The only upsides I found to it was the ease/quickness with which it can be applied, and not being able to feel it on your face."
137271,0,"Made in China, previously they probably weren't; though I can't say for sure. I prefer Champion combs(not made in China) as they are cut to shape and not molded resulting in a smoother comb. Material seems cheaper as well. I'll pass on buying these again."
75201,0,Wasn't particularly impressed with this product. The odor was just ok. Wouldn't pay that much money for a soap I use daily since this one doesn't last any longer than my usual brand.
218952,0,"The text is simple and restricted to the name of the mascara. Difficult to tell what is unique about it and why I should buy it. The bottle is slender and small and would fit nicely in a small purse. The mirror on the back side is a nice touch, the perfect size and effective for applying mascara on the go.The brush is fairly standard, though the pile is on the thicker side. The chocolate color is also pleasant, but standard. The liquid appears to be a little bit clumpy. The combination of the thicker pile of the brush and narrower opening of the bottle causes the mascara to build up on the outside edge of the opening, as the brush is plunged in and out during application.The product however, coats the eyelashes nicely. There are few, if any clumps, and the lashes are separate."
74398,0,"I purchased this hair turban because a previous one I purchased from Sephora years ago finally bit the dust. I found the old one useful in keeping my hair out of my way as I was getting ready, and the material it was made of helped dry my hair faster than a regular towel. The Aquis Microfiber towel secures your hair very well, but the material it's made of leaves a lot to be desired. For some reason, it doesn't dry your hair much faster than a regular towel. While it's technically microfiber, it doesn't feel as high quality as the Sephora brand (which is also more expensive). However, it works well for keeping your hair secure and out of the way; the elastic that goes around your head is pretty tight (but not uncomfortably so), and the loop with the button work very well. I'd say buy this only if you want a better alternative to using a heavy bath towel on your head. If you want something that will speed up drying time, check out the microfiber turban from Sephora. When this one wears out, I'll probably go back to the Sephora brand."
31444,2,I love the smell of lemongrass but this was a little overwhelming and the soap seemed to dissolve away to quickly. Lathered up nice and left skin feeling good but fragrance was to strong for me.
207539,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Colors are all similar & the polishes are low quality. I literally received 8 bottles of Love My Nails polishes, which can be purchased for 99 cents at many stores. This is not a $129.99 value, as it states under the product info. I was going to give this to a friend as a Christmas present, but would be completely embarrassed. I guess that's what I get for going into this blind & allowing them to choose the 20 polishes to put in my order. Do not make the same mistake I did! To the seller: maybe you should let the customer know exactly which polishes you plan on giving the customer before you send them 4 of the same shade polish (which is what happened to me!). Or maybe you should let the customer choose which colors/brands they would like. Because the system you have now is not customer-friendly & frankly, it's sketch. Can't believe I fell for it, but at least I have time to return it. Customers, SAVE YOUR MONEY. DO NOT BUY."
104110,2,"I ordered this parfume spray as a gift and it wasn,t the original. I purchased the original so many times from the department stores. Even the box was fake. Iam very dissappointed. Thanks..."
65390,0,"When I sampled this scent I was attracted to the smokey wood tones, and it has been a nice addition to my collection. I've never gone for the all-too-common citrus scents, and I was glad to find this alternative. But after wearing it a few times my verdict is that the smokey/black pepper aroma is just a little too dominant and could have been softened a bit, maybe with a trace of jasmine or even light sandalwood. The pepper overtone reminds me a lot of Dolce & Gabanna's Pour Homme. Tommy Bahama might have come close to being one of my favorites, but while I like the masculine tone I feel little too much like I've just walked out of a barbeque place if I apply more than a trace, hence the three stars. But because I enjoy having a variety of masculine scents to choose from, I am glad to have this around even though it is not at the top of my list alongside favorites like the discontinued Abercrombie & Fitch Woods (for casual wear) or Roger & Gallet's L'Homme (for dress up). (I found that softening the Tommy Bahama with a trace of Woods yields an almost ideal fragrance for me.)"
133583,0,I am 49 years old male and after 3 months no noticeable growth. I still have hair but it's thinning on the front hair line and has receded about a half an inch over the years. Maybe this product will slow down the hair loss but I don't think I'll ever see hair growth at my age. Great price for the product and I have not experienced any side effects.
183466,0,I don't see how some of the reviews would call this hair dryer light weight. It's pretty heavy compared to the cheap drugstore brands.
251271,0,"This product works well for toning the skin, but the name is horrifying. Obviously, Estee Lauder marketing did not do enough research into what the term, ""throat lotion"", means in the urban vernacular."
110321,0,"Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it. Its a tad thick for my taste but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application."
203211,2,"I was so excited to start using this product and agree with multiple reviews stating that the product is practically the same as rubbing alcohol. It did nothing but dry out my skin and I used it for two weeks twice a day and saw not a single improvement in my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and get harsh painful razor burn and ingrown hairs that cover my legs from top to bottom, and this product did not a thing to reduce any of it."
224147,1,This brush is awesome..better than my $65.00 brush....I was so happy to finally find it again.
33394,1,"This perfume is my favorite! I have worn it for many years, and I always get a cimpliment when I pass a stranger and they smell it. They ask me for the name of the perfume. It is not too sweet. I usually have problems wearing many perfumes, because of my acid-like chemistry. This perfume always seems to be just right for me. It has a hint of spice and a bit of floral mixed together. It also lasts for quite a long time after you spray it on. I highly recommend it!"
149817,0,Es un buen producto. Lo que no me gusta es que a causa del Retinol no se puede usar por las ma&ntilde;anas para no exponerse al sol. No lo vuelvo a comprar.
82116,1,"This product really does what it promises. Frequency of shaving did reduce once I started using this. Hair growth was slower and whatever hair grew was softer and lighter. I gave this only 4 stars because I didnt like the way it smelled. It didnt smell bad, but I wouldnt wear that scent if this were a perfume. Also, this moisturizer doesnt offer UV protection."
246030,1,"I am not sure if I'm qualified to rate this as a ""tanning"" lotion; I never really paid attention to the quality of my tan, since I was spending time in the bed for health reasons (psoriasis). When you tan for only 5-8 minutes at a time in a medium bed, I wouldn't call bronzing your goal.What I can tell you, as someone with sensitive skin AND psoriasis, is that this never ONCE:* irritated* itched* burnedAnd it doesn't have:* mineral oil (duh, it's for tanning)* fragranceDo you know how impossible it is to find a regular facial moisturizer, even for sensitive skin, without mineral oil? Nearly IMPOSSIBLE. I used this for both tanning AND my regular every day moisturizer with fantastic results. I highly recommend it, especially if you have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make your skin react. As with anything, if you have sensitive skin, you should test some first before doing your whole face."
246401,0,"When I first began using this product, I definitely saw results for the first two weeks. After that period of time however it appeared as though the product stoped working as effectively as it had in the beginning and my dandruff was starting to show up again. I'm not sure if my scalp somehow became tolerant to the product to the point where the product was no longer effective, or the product I had bought might've been too old. I think it's definitely worth a shot to test this product out, but if you don't find lasting results then don't bother buying it again."
98258,0,"Having received a sample of the parfum version, I was hooked. Just one spray and I would get the pleasure of gentle wafts of the pleasant aroma all day. I decided to get a bottle of this intoxicating juice, but to my shock the parfum was incredibly expensive. The toilette was much more reasonable, so I made a purchase. Surely it can't be that different?It is. Although it is unmistakably from the same family, the toilette is like the slightly uglier sibling. The perfect balance of aromas is gone, replaced with a slightly off, astringent quality. After spraying it once and not getting the same intensity, I sprayed a second time. Now it is about 3 hours later, and I don't smell it at all! What happened to the longevity?I long for the parfum version, but can't justify its price. Such is life."
126475,0,"I was pretty excited to receive this Hot Tools flat iron. I had used my ConAir one for about 2 years before I wanted something that had more heat and could straighten my hair even if it was slightly damp. Well, this flat iron did exactly that, for about 6 months. It left my hair shiny, straight, and ridiculously soft. I used it once every 2 days, for about 5 months (being that for a whole month I was out of the country) and now the thing won't even heat up. I leave it plugged in for 20 minutes and its still as cold as ice. Also, the on and off button keeps sliding so when you're using the straightener you'll find it goes cold sometimes because the switch has been turned off. If you're looking for something to last, I wouldn't invest my money in this one."
172899,2,"I've tried them all. Proactiv, Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, Phisoderm, Clinique, other over-the-counter treatments, as well as prescription washes, creams, and pills. I can honestly say this is the WORST one I've ever tried. Seriously disappointed.I used this religiously for three weeks and my acne has actually gotten worse... not one sign of improvement. And if that isn't enough, the creams are not even comfortable to put on - the night cream being the worst. It's thick and sticky and leaves your face feeling like a dried up raisin. It dries out your face and makes it tight and itchy. Seriously unpleasant. The day cream has an SPF in it, and although that sounds appealing, I feel like all that's in it is sunscreen. It smells like sunscreen and makes my face extremely oily. The general face was is okay but leaves a bit of buildup unless you spend five minutes rinsing.So please... read all of the reviews here and make the decision for yourself. Everyone's skin is different, but at least take this review under consideration. It's a serious waste of mulah!"
119373,0,"It beats going to the salon & getting charged an arm & a leg, but by no means is this perfection. Be very careful about color selection and/or how long you leave it on for. Also, I've had relatives (who both used to be beauticians) use this to color my hair, & both times there was still a little bit of grey left on the sides. Really wouldn't recommend that you shampoo it in yourself."
221767,0,"Lacoste Booster is a fairly cheap cologne but it's kind of tough to find nowadays. It's not overpowering and doesn't last too long. It's on the borderline of smelling like a woman's perfume. Basically it's what you wear when you have a controlling and nitpicking girlfriend who wants you to get manicures with her, so...if a girlfriend buys this for you because she ""likes the way it smells"" head for the hills."

56020,2,"I purchased the Helen of Troy SoftTouch Volumizing diffuser about a month ago. It claimed to fit most hairdryers, it did not fit the one I had purchased recently even though the hairdryer I have is quite small. Also, I found it was very cheaply made; it's thin plastic so I found it really impractical to use since when you trying to slip it onto a hairdryer, it is so thin, there is a fear that it may break. So I haven't used the diffuser for this reason."
193542,1,in addition to my training with makiwara boards i find the iron palm bag essential to my conditioning. although surprisingly heavy for its size its pretty portable. this makes it convenient for training both indoors or out. my bag is filled with stainless steel bb's but you can replace it with lighter material like beans or rice if you are just starting out and then progress to more resistant material later.
191108,1,I wouldn't go a day without using it! It doesn't clump or flake and I don't feel like it is noticeable that I am using it! Love it and it is the only brand that doesn't flake!
70119,0,Purchased this Headband on Amazon & I am Fairly unimpressed. The day I wore it in Ohio it was not that hot or humid low 80's & about 72% & I am not a Runner who Sweats Heavily. Soaked it through & had sweat running down my Nose. About an hour later it still was not dry and it had been laying on the Kitchen table & the AC was on in the house. Will stick with my Ratty Nike Featherlite Visor.
183825,0,This hairdryer does have some oomph to it! It also has temp choices. I like the velvety grip on the handle. It does not seem to dry as thoroughly as an ionic or ceramic variations.
190132,0,"i really appreciate the quality of the liptstick-being made with good ingredients and not all those artificial chemicals. the color was also pretty true to what you see in the picture, of course, i expected with my dark lips that it wouldn't pop as much as if i had lighter colored lips. with this expectation in mind, it was still a bit of a let down that for the price it didn't hold up at all. it rubbed off pretty quickly-i had to repeatedly reapply. all in all, even for the price i wasn't too dissappointed. maybe you might have a better experience and not eat like a cow like i do with the lipstick on :^>"
80128,1,"My hair is naturally curly,wavy,frizzy and dry all in one. It is also very dry and gets tangled. I applied this mask to my hair and felt a difference almost immediately. This mask detangled my hair and I didn't have to struggle with comb. After I rinsed it I just let it air dry and it just felt different and looked different. It was shiny and more manageable. A great buy to me. I am definitely going to order again. :)"
210542,0,The only reason I give it 3 stars is the VERY strong aroma. The scent is very noticeable and lingers for quite some time.
173884,1,Love this foot scrubber! It's not too harsh as to be uncomfortable but not too soft as to be too tickly to work. The only problem I have is: it's more blue than purple. I have a lilac bathroom it does'nt look purple at all.
15226,0,"After reading all of the good reviews, I'm pretty disappointed with this product. I don't think it is necessarily any better than any of the other ingrown hair products I've tried (eg. Bump Patrol) and its more expensive. It is soothing to the skin (no burning) and has a nice scent, which is nice compared to other products but I don't think it warrants the increased cost. It also hasn't helped to fade the dark spots from past ingrown hairs (which others had mentioned). I think I would recommend sticking with one of the cheaper alternatives."
7749,0,Smells great when you spray it on but fades away really quickly. I like when I use a cologne for a while that my jacket starts to smell like it a bit at all times and that simply never happened :/Pros:*Good price*Smells goodCons:*Scent doesnt last

123366,2,"I'm a 51 year old woman whose eyebrows have been getting a little thin at the ends. I thought this product would be a good way for me to get a nice, even brow. Based on the reviews I purchased it. It has been a big disappointment. First, the brush that comes with the kit can only be used with the stencil so if the stencil isn't the shape you want you won't be able to use the huge brush that comes with it you'll have to acquire a different brush. The eyebrow stencils are all quite thin, even the one marked thick and all are very angular. If your natural eyebrows are more rounded like mine the stencil just won't fit. Also, while other reviewers said the product stayed on all day I have to mention that the first time I used it I accidentally brushed up against my eyebrow right after applying it and completely erased that eyebrow.I tried to use the stencil, more than once, just on the ends of my eyebrows with limited success. I tried using the eyebrow color on it's own with no stencil and a different brush but truthfully, I have some Maybelline eyebrow powder color that was half the price and does just as good a job. I'd probably like this product if I had a different stencil that more accurately fit my eyebrow. For now, it's a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this. I have gone back to my eyebrow pencil."
66013,1,"I bought the Maxiglide and wasn't quite sure what to expect. You see these infomercials on TV, then you go buy them, and they don't do what they say. When I finally received my Maxiglide, I was blown away. Usually it takes me about an hour to do my hair, sometimes longer. When I used the Maxiglide, it only took me 10 minutes!! No joke!! My husband was really impressed too!! He said, ""Now if you could find something to wear in less time than that!"" I would and have recommended this product to my friends and family. Works great!!!"
63366,0,"Web MD recommends the Olay Regenerist line so I tried it. This product is easy to apply but, so far after a few weeks, I have no results. I also did not like the small pump bottle. I couldn't get it to work a few times. Maybe a tube would be better."
31474,1,"Third bottle for me. I wear virtually no makeup, but when I do want a little cover and even tone, this is it. Flows smoothly, covers evenly, doesn't leave a dry or dusty look, matches my skin tone, even when it changes over the seasons, somehow. I use a moisturizer (Neutrogena for me) under it, working it in very well, which may help."
203681,0,"I was up late one night with my 3 year old daughter and caught the infomercial for Wen. It sounded too good to be true. I am white with shoulder length naturally curly hair that leans toward the fine side. It's more than wavy but not kinky curly--by the end of the day it looks like a bad perm. My daughter is African (from Ethiopia) with 8"" super kinky natural afro hair. So I was excited to see if Wen would work. After reading several reviews I decided to get it on Amazon so I didn't have to worry about the issue of Wen sending me more each month and charging my account.We have been using the Wen Fig Cleansing Conditioner for about 3 weeks now.Ok, so here are the results:On my hair:I am white with shoulder length curly hair. I like the smell (some other people didn't like it, I guess). It was not too strong, but does have an odd smell that is different than most hair care products. I LOVED the 1 step. It left my hair shiny and soft. The first time I used it I did not put any styling products on it, just let it dry naturally. My hair seemed a little limp when it dried and not very curly or springy. The next morning I used a large round brush to straighten it. It blew out really easy and was soft and silky. I did not even need to use a flat iron. That was nice, since straightening my hair usually means 3 steps: drying it, using a round brush to blow it out, and then a flat iron to smooth it.Overall, I like it, but now when I am leaving my hair curly I will put another product in it called ""beautiful curls"" that I buy at beautifulcurls(.)net that gives my hair more defined curls and body. I will continue to use it and may even try other ""flavors"" to see which I like the best.It was a bit of a letdown after watching the infomercial, though.On my daughters hair:She is Ethiopian 3 years old with very kinky, nappy beautiful natural hair that is about 8"" when pulled straight. It is very thick (for a 3 year old) and very, very dry. I have struggled to find the right product for her hair. I have spent a LOT of money and a lot of time trying to find the right products for her (olive oil, kinky-curly, beautiful curls, mixed chicks, carols daughter--you name it, I have probably tried it) . I was so excited to try Wen on her hair. The results were not as good as I had expected, but not altogether bad. I love the one step process. It is easy and simple to use in the bathtub or shower. It did leave her soft and fluffy, but somewhat dry and a bit dull. I even used 5-6 pumps as a leave in conditioner. That seemed to make her hair more ""dull"" than usual. It did clean her hair well, though.The next week I washed her hair with Wen and then used ""Beautiful Curls (see website above) as the leave in conditioner. That did the trick. It defined her curls and made her hair nice and shiny. Each morning I spray her hair with a combo of water and Beautiful Curls and style it as usual.The Bottom Line:Wen is the not as good as the TV ads claim. It is not a miracle product. I like it well enough to buy it again. The cost is comparable to what I was using before. The one step process is nice. I like how it leaves my hair and my daughters hair soft.I think a lot depends on the type hair you have and where you live. We live in Arizona where it is soooo dry. If we lived in a more humid climate we may have a different review of the product.I say give it a try and see what happens."
176874,0,"I would pay for this pillow w/ shipping & delivery charges around $20.95 just because its not worth $29.95I got the pillow yesterday and I put it right away in the tub however after 5 minutes, I noticed the pillow was fell down. I kept on pressing on the pillow to attach it to the tub, kept on falling down. Even cleaned the area with wet cloth and tried to re-attach it, kept on falling down. So I shall see! Maybe it needs some of that hot water heat and it will stick to the tub.Because once I got it wet a little it wasn't falling down.So my only disappointment-wasn't sticking to the tub."
232377,2,"The curlers in this product are better described as medium and small, so they are a challenge for longer hair.Also, they don't seem to heat evenly, so playing around to get them all up to temperature wastes some time -precious time when getting ready for work or other appointments. Also the clips do not hold the curler in well.I would hesitate about recommending these, as I will soon be replacing the set I purchased just a few months ago."
189131,1,I really like this gloss. It is nice and thick. Gives lips a beautiful shine. Can be worn alone without lipstick or liner. Kind of pricey but worth it. It is better than most glosses in that price range. The tube is perfect sized.
139874,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's been discontinued and you may get an old item like we did.My wife likes this product and couldn't find it in the stores anymore, so she purchased it here.

62051,2,"I started using Tints of Nature 4N to try to correct the dreadful redness that came with the Naturtint colours. My hair is a medium golden-brown and I was aiming for a darker golden-brown. My results were:- Less fake-looking red undertones than Nauturtint.- Colour lasted about 3 weeks before fading became obvious. About 60% colour remained at 3-4 weeks.- Greys were covered adequately.- Condition was bearable. Hair was 'squeaky' and tangled easily, rather than soft and silky, and the ends were suffering, but all of this was less severe than with some other chemical dyes.- No allergies or irritation.- After 3+ months of using this product once every 3-4 weeks my HAIR WAS FALLING OUT at such a rate that my hairdresser panicked and wanted me to see a doctor! My hair became so thin it was ridiculous. I had to stop using the product.At this point I officially gave up on chemical hair dyes! I researched how to use a mix of natural Henna, Indigo and Amla herb powders. This has been freakin' fantastic!!! My results are:- Hair loss normalised within 2-3 weeks.- Condition is superb - silky, soft, full.- Colour is natural-looking and very resilient - 90% remaining after 3-4 weeks.- Grays are adequately covered.- I am not doing untold damange to my health and the environment by using gross chemicals.I WILL NEVER LOOK BACK. I am actually ashamed that I was so ignorant of this awesome, far superior option for safely colouring hair! For anyone whose hair is on the spectrum of 'stawberry blonde - copper - auburn - brown - black' (i.e. everyone except blondes) I cannot recommend highly enough that you dump chemical colours and learn to mix and use henna/indigo/amla at home. There's no comparison and you will never look back."

50258,0,Produce just like described. The service was wonderful but I had to return the item. The wife already bought one. the return went smooth. I will do business with them again.
182730,2,"These definitely cut well enough, but as soon as you get them out of the box, you see that the construction quality is shoddy. They just look cheap, with very rough finishing. Additionally, after a few weeks, they started to rust terribly and are now a rusted mess. This is only from keeping them on my bathroom shelf and never getting them wet. Low quality product way overpriced. 1 star."

Not only will it rev you up in the shower by exfoliating your skin and stimulating circulation, it releases the most wonderful scent and natural oils that give you a renewed and refreshed feeling.It's also long-lasting. You can get about thirty uses from it, according to the packaging! This is great stuff according to me, and now, according to Oprah!I hope you'll trust at least one of us and give this a try!"

185278,0,"I bought this product a few months ago and used it religiously for about a month and a half. I would use it after cleansing morning and night. I can't say that I love the product, but I also do not hate it either. The smell at first was very odd and almost unbearable, but it quickly went away and after reading about the wonderful things it could do for acne, I sucked it up. After about 2 or 3 weeks, the smell did not bother me so I was happy about that; I think I just got used to it. After using this for a month and a half, I can say that it did not do anything for my acne. It did not make it better, or worse. The only thing it really did was clean up the extra things my cleanser did not and it dried my face out slightly (I do have a sensitive face so, this might be the reason. However, I am usually pretty oily). Also, for those looking for an ""all natural"" product, this one is not. It is 14% alcohol. For me, I am trying to find more natural products and go away from the chemicals and I was disappointed that a good percentage of this was alcohol. Alcohol can be an irritant for the skin so beware. I recently just bought ""Thayer: Witch Hazel Toner"" and it is alcohol free and seems to be working on my acne. It does not have the odd smell and I love it so far. It also does not dry out my skin. I would suggest trying that one instead of Dickinsons.However, I will keep this bottle as Witch Hazel has other uses besides on the face. I give them credit because it was a good price for a large bottle and it will last a very long time. I just would not recommend for the face or for curing acne as it did nothing for me."

5028,1,"I have combination skin which is also sensitive, but I don't need a moisturizer with SPF. It seems that everything comes with SPF these days!Neutrogena's Oil-Free Moisture is GREAT for combination skin. They do have another formula for sensitive skin (Neutrogena Moisture Oil Free Formula, Sensitive Skin - 4 fl oz) but if you have sensitive combo skin like I do, this product will mostly likely work well for you, too. It's fragrance free and non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) like most sensitive skin products. I wash my face in the morning and in the evening and use this moisturizer afterward both times. One pump is enough to last the whole day--I don't know how, but it keeps the dry parts moisturized and the oily parts un-shiny! I haven't tried it under makeup yet, but it looks and feels like it would do just fine.If you just need a plain old moisturizer without SPF, anti-aging voodoo or anything else, this is the way to go."

I'm 45 years old and was surprised to see this tighten my sagging skin. It's based on the Chinese acupressure method of using reflex points to stimulate the muscles. You only have to wear it for 15 minutes every other day, and it's been fabulous for toning my sagging skin and getting rid of wrinkles on my forehead and around my eys. I can read, watch tv, or do house work while wearing the mask. My skin just glows when I use this product."
154467,1,"I have been wearing liquid foundation for twenty years. I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers. I always go back to application by finger. Seems the easiest and most effective way. Then I saw Beauty Blender in a YouTube video. It intrigued me. I watched a few You tube tutorials, and decoded I should buy one. At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down. I've tried too many gimmicks... but this is no gimmick. It REALLY WORKS! It transforms your foundation to an airbrushed look. So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp). And you end up using less foundation.Hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!Suggest you go on YouTube and and view some BeautyBlender tutorials. It will help you perfect the application."

I had it a year and use it every 2 weeks without any problems. Great price. Buy one!"
74006,0,"UPDATED AUGUST 2011I bought my first jar of this cream in the winter & I loved it. It was a light, non-greasy moisturizer which was great for my oily skin. It seemed heavy when applied, but after it absorbed it left my skin with a nice matte finish, like a powder & moisturizer in one. I had to slather a lot on in winter, but since the formula was so gentle, the jar was big (4oz), & the price was affordable it wasn't a problem. The ingredients are vegan (came out with a 1-LOW risk score on the cosmetic safety database) and it's cruelty-free, so I thought I had found my face cream. I wrote a 5-star review & recommended it to others. Near the end of spring I bought my second jar & it started to develop a consistency issue about a third of the way through. The texture was more thick & lumpy and I had to stir it to get it smooth. I blamed this on the heat, so I stopped storing it in the bathroom which helped a little, but didn't totally eliminate the problem. I still had to stir it up frequently to get it smooth, but it was still moisturizing fine, just a little more tedious to apply. A slightly annoying problem, but not enough to keep me from buying the cream again. However, I was shocked when I applied my third jar (bought in July) & within 5 minutes my face was bright red. The previously gentle formula was completely harsh & burning! I contacted customer service & was told that yes they did have a quality problem with the product and would send me a replacement. The problem was related to the preservative level (Sodium Benzoate). Customer service was very friendly and my replacement & free samples were sent quickly. Unfortunately the replacement jar was not as wonderful as I hoped it would be. It didn't cause a severe reaction, which is good, but the formula was still slightly stringent & not moisturizing at all. This had previously been a light moisturizer, but now it dried out my face. I had to stop using it, because it was ineffective and not nearly as gentle as it had been.Overall, I got really fed up with this cream! I understand that they are trying to get the formula right for all seasons, but it would be better if they removed it from the market temporarily until they do rather than sell sub-par versions along the way. Especially ones that cause serious, harsh reactions. The company obviously does not perform quality checks, and apparently for D.E. no animal testing means no testing whatsoever. Customer service was top-notch, but they can only do so much. The production people need to get it together. Lately I've been using my body lotion,Nature's Gate - Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion, 18 fl oz lotion, as a face cream also, and it's working out well. I use other Desert Essence products (the SPF moisturizer hasn't given me trouble yet,Day Cream Gentle Nourishing Spf15 2 Ounces) and although this situation has given me doubts, I probably won't reject the company entirely. If you do have problems, the customer service department is very easy to deal with, and nowadays that's a rarity. But as for the Daily Essential cream, I probably won't buy again unless I learn that they've revamped the formula. Make it as gentle as it was in winter, without spoiling in summer.Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glyceryl Stearate (Vegetable Derived), Stearic Acid (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Palmitate (Plant Derived), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Propanediol (Corn Derived), Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin (Plant Derived), Gluconolactone, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, Geranium Maculatum Oil (Plant Derived)"

I purchased the Conair curler set specifically for travel purposes and I have to say, the Remington set went back into its box and up in the closet. I use the Conair set for everyday use now and I love them. The Remington set left my hair kind of ""fly awayish"" from static or something. The Conair set, while giving great volume and curl, eliminates the static, giving a much healthier look and shine to my hair. And the final advantage, there are no clip marks left from use.

180742,0,"This dryer is lightweight and easy to handle. It worked great for a year then stopped working. Now it will only blow cold air so it takes a LONG time to get my hair dry (and my hair is pretty thin).

I just wished it would've lasted longer."

881,0,"I was hoping that this would take the place of both blow dryer and flat iron, but it didn't finish the ends of my hair smoothly enough to truly replace the iron. Maybe with some practice using the cold setting to finish the ends, it will get better. Here are some of the advantages of the product: 1) The ionic dryer doesn't throw off extra heat (it goes directly to your hair), so I didn't work up a sweat the way I do with my old blow dryer. 2) The built in brush is easier to use than holding a brush separately in your other hand, though the highest tension setting isn't strong enough to grab my hair. 3) If you can just use this product without having to finish off with a flat iron (maybe if your hair isn't so curly), then it's faster than drying + ironing. FYI: my hair is thick, between chin & shoulder length, and pretty curly. Overall, I think I will use it, but it's not as miraculous as the ads (and some of the reviews) make it sound."

I'm going to give it a few more weeks and if I don't see more improvement I'm going to stop using it.
72019,0,"Years ago when I started wearing makeup in the dark ages (I'm 62 now) I always used cake eyeliner because it is easy to apply and to control the line width and darkness. As an added benefit, the eyeliner cake lasted for literally years. To my chagrin, when I tried to replace my Clinique cake eyeliner it was no longer available, and I couldn't find anything comparable in department stores or drug stores. I was resigned to struggling with pencil or gel eyeliner products for some years. Then I was inspired to search for ""cake eyeliner"" on Amazon, and up popped ""Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson"" in brown or black. Eureka! I ordered a cake in brown and it is unfortunately just OK. It is easy to apply, but it is almost black it is so dense, and it is very difficult to remove. I use washable mascara, and I expected that this eyeliner product that is mixed with water to apply would also be washable, but it is definitely long lasting. If you like to use eye makeup remover this would be the product for you!"

When I called I was told that it was shipped to Tennessee instead of Texas. I was told at that time it was being shipped that day. I also received an email 2 days later telling me the warehouse had burned and orders had not been shipped. They evidently forgot the story that it had been shipped to TN. I finally got my shipment and a refund."

177858,2,"I gave the keratin shampoo and conditioner a month to see if it would work and all it did was make my hair worse. I liked it at first, it smelled great. but about half way through the month my hair was weaker then it was before, all broken and dirty feeling. It made it almost impossible to even get my fingers though my hair when it was wet, and combing it when dry was so difficult that i ended up breaking a lot of it. It also made my hair feel dirty and greasy. I had to was my hair twice a much not to feel dirty, which also lead to the brittle broken hair. Over all I was shocked at how terrible these products were. Oh and don't let me forget to mention It did absolutely nothing to smooth or straighten my hair. I wasn't even able to flat iron my hair while using the products due to the terrible condition then turned my hair. I used the shampoo, the conditioner, and the anti breakage serum. None of them did. I bought the flat iron spray, but didn't have the opportunity to use it. I will be throwing the remainder of the products out. To the best of my memory I cannot think of a family of products that are worse then these. As a new customer to the Orgainx brand, I say with all certainty that I will never buy another product again, and will try my best to pass on my experience to as many people as possible."

The only way I can stand this is if I spray it on my clothes the day before and the next day there's a faint smell"
221324,2,I thought with so many good reviews it would work for my 18 month old. Maybe she is allergic to something in it but it makes her eczema even drier and flakier and now she is waking up at night scratching herself. But I gave it 2 stars becuase oddly it is the only cream to help my dry heels and feet. So i am on the hunt again for something to relieve my daughters hand and body eczema. It kind of stinks too. Pump is helpful though for ease of use.

I only applied this threesome once and it dried out my skin for 3 days. My face also felt burnt and itchy for 3 day as well. I do have sensitive skin but Ive used proactive in the past and it was great, cleared my skin up, and no burning. Lesson learned, dont go for the imitators, spend the money on proactive."

197180,0,"I expected a little more from this product. Beware, there is no heat adjustment, so you just have an on or off. Therefore, it is a little too hot to use on my five year old. I tried some else's Chi, which led me to purchase this one, they said get any of them, but apparently this one isn't as good. I switched from a Hot-tools (ceramic), which still works great but is getting little worn, its about 5 years old. I don't think there was much of a difference from the first day I used the Hot-Tools and the Chi. I thought that the Chi wouldn't smell like burning hair when I used it, but it does! So, Its okay, but I think you could go with any Ceramic. (BTW I have mixed hair, if this helps)"

223266,2,"In case you couldn't tell by the other reviews, this is old lady perfume. I used a small amount before work and immediately tried (and failed) to wash it off. Unfortunately the smell of the perfume is also very strong. 8 hours later and I still smell like my grandmother...and I'm sure all of my coworkers can smell it before they see/hear me coming. I feel like I need to smoke a pack of cigarettes while wearing it to get the full experience. My husband has banned me from wearing this perfume again. I just can't wait to get home and take a shower. Will be looking for a little old lady to give my bottle of perfume to...or someone I don't like."

No.Would I recommend it to somebody else? No."
173756,2,"It does the job. The product quality is great but the lids do not stay screwed on tightly as others. Its compact and great for traveling or carrying it for everyday. The bad thing is that for the largest case, i placed my power foundation and its a bit too small for that. i use the lid to spread the foundation and the powder gets stuck in between the screw lines and causes the container to become loose. One of the lids with a clear top, the clear part came off. now there's the use of the lid."

I just put it on, go do the dishwasher or something and then take a shower and get it off. I take it off in the shower with water/soap and then follow it up with the mint julep facial scrub. When I get out of the shower my face is smooth, pores are reduced and my skin is glowing.The bottle lasts forever too!"
178009,2,The product feels nice on the lips. But it did not do what it promised. Way too pricy.
219857,0,"I used this kit tonight. This is only the 3rd time I have used a brush on kit. I usually use a cap or have my hair foiled at the salon. I have to say this technique takes a lot of practice. About two minutes in to the application I gave up on the brush and used my fingers to select the hair pieces. I have shoulder length, very thin hair and I did not have enough product to finish the job. I will have to purchase another box tomorrow. Good thing the price is very reasonable."
55336,1,"I'd been eyeing this product at Walgreen's for months but didn't purchase it because...well...it seemed too good to be true. And the price - yikes! But about a week ago, after feeling the telltale signs of two more developing blemishes, I decided to take the plunge. (I am appearing in a play that opens in three weeks and just couldn't face the thought of zits that might last that long - or additional ones.) I immediately went home and treated the spots. How did they diminish right away?! I almost wept with joy.Yeah, the thing's expensive. BUT...when I figure I spent $100 last summer to have a doctor lance a single blemish that had already been there three weeks (and ended up looking hideous for another two), it's worth it. Also, if you have a flexible medical account...or itemize on your taxes...Zeno is DEDUCTIBLE. (That was a very happy surprise.) And, of course, there's the immeasurable psychological benefit of not walking around looking like an adolescent when you're 47."
220221,0,"So I ordered this brush after reading the other reviews and was expecting it to instantly detangle my daughter's knot-prone hair. It didn't. It does work well on children's hair (and my own as well) when it is wet or dry. But, if the hair is very knotty (as my daughter's is), this does not work wonders. It's ok for the price but will not do anything super."
89733,2,"This is my first review on Amazon and though I'm a long time shopper here I usually do not take the time to write reviews. In this case I thought it was needed since there are literally hundreds of products that claim to reduce dark circles or puffiness under the eyes. I bought this product based on reviews here and on other websites with high hopes that it was a cheap and effective treatment. It was cheap, but totally uneffective. I have been using this product over a month religiously and have seen no change whatsoever in the appearance of the areas under my eyes. Won't be purchasing another time."
177112,1,"This body wash is great. I have skin that dries out easily, so during our Michigan winters, I usually splurge on a moisturizing body wash. This year, instead, I have been using Neutrogena Body Oil after my shower. I use the oil right after I turn off the water, before I get out of the shower. I stand for a minute to allow the oil to penetrate. With this method, I do not need the extra moisture in a body wash. I've fallen in love with Neutrogena products. I've seen Rainbath at the pharmacy before, but I finally bought some a few weeks ago and was instantly hooked. The scent is quite pleasant. People complain that it wears off too soon, but I prefer a product with a scent that isn't so strong that you are ""stuck"" with it all day (that's what perfume is for). I wish the body oil came in the same scent though. This body wash does not dry out my skin (surprisingly), and it leaves no residue. It is now my go-to product for body wash."

I've been using it for 2 months now and have really only seen about a 50% reduction in the bumps on my arms. I've been using it as directed 2-3 times a week (basically every other day)and I've tried using a washcloth to try and get a little extra scrubbing action and the bumps are still not totally gone. I'll keep using it until its gone (its a pretty big tub so it will last quite a while) but I probably won't buy it again unless it starts working better. I guess this just isn't for everyone.
73822,0,"Normally when I would use a Glycolic cream on sale at Ross, I could tell it was improving my skin. This one I can't tell any difference and the first few times it seemed like it actually contributed to pore clogging. It's possible I'm beyond hope at this point (hormonal acne makes everything feel like it doesn't work).The other thing is the smell. It's a subtle and non-chemical smell that's mildly annoying. I have aloe and I know it's not the aloe that smells like that."
134842,1,"Bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to Europe. Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews. Great dryer but LOUD!"
243446,0,"While I understand your desire to clean your face, and clean it well, this formula makes skin ""sensitive skin."" I couldn't wash without the feeling I was using a medicated soap or bleach to wash my face, and I could feel the smell get into my eyes and nose. After using for about a week, I gave up and got the foaming clenser instead. It does the job, it's just very strong. If you *really* need some powerful cleaning, this'll work."
237420,0,"i have tried using this product when hand washing dishes and i don't know if i am sold when it comes to greasy dishes. there still seems to be a film left on them. in other uses, i really like it. the smell is a little unpleasant."
86878,0,I've been using this product nightly for a couple of months and i dont' really notice any difference in my pore size. It does help keep the oil down on my face though.
139853,0,"This product is very disappointing. I thought L'Oreal Paris was supposed to be a higher-end product than most, but alas it isn't any better than what I find in the dollar store."
25041,0,This perfume is nice but does not smell like my type of perfume...it is a clean smelling perfume but I perfer perfumes that smell more floral...if you like clean smelling perfumes that smell like soap this if for you!
178305,1,My skin breaks out if I even say the word pimple so I have to be very careful about what I use. This helps keep my outbreaks to a minimum. I also have &#34;more mature&#34; skin so a good moisturizer is important. This product is moisturizing without being greasy. It's really the perfect balance for temperamental skin like mine. I've spent a ton on pricey face creams but this one gives the others a run for their money!
5027,1,"If you have dry when washed to oily few hours later skin like me - which I find a lot of South Asians do, this product is fantastic for you. First it's super light, hydrates and doesn't cause your face to develop excessive amounts of oil like many other moisturizers out there.Highly recommend product, part of my Subscribe & Save items!"
220066,2,Nope. Works better as a hair serum than on my skin. It eliminates frizz wihout weighing my baby blonde fair hair down and won't cause breakouts. Disappointed with it as a facial....anything. Oh well. I say buy obaji and save your money on this product.
216294,2,"I've used the Nair depilatory cream for legs and even that product is hit and miss. But the specific product they make for the face does even less than that. 10 minutes is the maximum recommended time to leave it on. After 15 minutes I gently dabbed it away with a warm washcloth. Behold, still facial hair underneath all of it.I wouldn't recommend leaving it on for more than that, or you'd get some nasty irritation. In fact- I wouldn't recommend this at all!"
142310,0,"Company shipped product fast. The hair is not real wavey when you wet it. I also tried to dye it a darker color and it did not take very well. Over all the price is good for the hair. I would not buy the hair if it was at its usual sell price. One plus its a 100% human hair, thats why I can understand why it wouldnt dye. Oh well I am happy with my braids :)"
39442,1,Strawberry my Daiquiri is one of The Balms best shades. The natural rose tone lip gloss is smooth and lasts. Your lips appear plumper.
160739,2,"I never received my product from the seller and had to submit a claim to Amazon. It was a Christmas gift so that made me very upset. The person would have probably liked the cologne but I guess well never know. However, Amazon was very prompt and helpful."
200030,0,"I had a CONAIR dryer for nine years and it's finally on its last legs. Got this one after reading the rave reviews. It's quiet, and it dries fast. But if you have even a smidgen of product on your hands, forget trying to operate the controls. I have almost resorted to using my teeth! Very weird, because everything else about this dryer is very good. Oh, and one more thing. Would it have killed them to add a retractable cord?"
222617,0,"I first bought this product to use as a shampoo for my dandruff and a soap for my tinea versacolor, which I probably picked up after going on a course of antibiotics. It worked all right for both, no better or worse than I was expecting. The active ingredient, zinc pyrithione, has been found to be moderately effective against several fungi of the genus Malassezia. Malassezia is usually the cause of both tinea versacolor and dandruff. That said, I've now switched to Nizoral Dandruff Shampoo, which uses ketoconazole as it's active ingredient. In America, the OTC version of Nizoral is limited at 1% ketoconazole, but in Canada where I live the cap is at 2%.This soap bar is okay. The concentration of zinc pyrithione is strong enough to be effective and you can certainly feel the drying side-effect of it on your skin. I actually wouldn't recommend this as a shampoo without some sort of follow-up acidic conditioner because the product is really basic (non-acidic), as are all natural soaps, and dried out my hair somewhat. To be honest, the mix of natural soap and zinc pyrithione isn't fantastic in terms off keeping things reasonably moisturised. After a few weeks of use, my hair was brittle and my skin felt really quite uncomfortable. Not really a problem with the product, but I really wished they'd included more effective humectants to counteract the drying effect. I wouldn't use this on your face.I'm not sure why the oatmeal was included. It doesn't change the effectiveness of the soap and was unnoticeable from a comfort standpoint. The smell is neutral with a very slight oily-metallic odour that disappears once you rinse it off. One bar lasts a long, long time for me. At least several months. Overall, this product pulled no suprises, either good or bad. It's okay.If you are battling tinea versacolour or dandruff and can spare the change, try using Nizoral Dandruff Shampoo. If you have long hair, short nails, or both use ashampoo brush, so that you can effectively reach your scalp. No matter which product you use, make sure it stays in contact with the affected area for at least five minutes so it can work it's fungi-killing magic. Wash often. This goes for both your body and the things that touch your body, like bedspreads and towels. Good luck."
235856,0,"As with the Mist-Er Right, this product makes my hair gummy and sticky. I'm hoping with the continued use of the No-Poo and the One Condition, my hair will improve and I'll be able to use this product (sparingly). All the products smell wonderful. I can see this one with the Mist-Er Right being excellent for people with thicker, longer hair. :)"
84917,2,"I dont understand the great ratings. This product is like a fake proactiv, and proactiv is garbage. The cream dried and damaged my skin. The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin. Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews. I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results."
80240,2,"Don't know what is going on with this online Essie lacquer. I purchase Essie all the time; at the salon, and even at my local department store. Never have I seen this product so watered down. I know Essie has a sheers products line; however, not the ones I normally wear. Sugar Daddy is a new Essie color, and I know this is not supposed to be a sheer. But to verify my knowledge, of this product, I went to the department store, and pulled the SUGAR DADDY, and opened it, and it was soft, semi opaque, not sheer. Two or three coats will do the trick. Guess I'll continue to spend more money for OPI, and Essie locally; therefore I'll know what I am getting, before I buy it; and won't have to spend extra money on return shipping, that will not be reimbursed; even though it is a lesser quality product.I think it is in the pricing; if you normally pay 8.00-10.00 for either of the basic lacquers; more than likely this product will be the opaque version.Don't know where they are buying this stuff from? The sellers are great thoughUpdate: seller did refund cost of product, and shipping! Thanks H.O.A"
215234,2,I used this product because I was told it was created without chemicals by the inventors for his wife who had cancer. How true this story is I don't know however it irrated my scalp I give it only one star as I am sensative to many chemicals. If you are sensative I would not recommend this.
102553,0,The fragrance is very good. It lasts for around 3-4 hours even if we drive two wheeler or move outdoors. Considered to be a long period in Indian conditions.
79147,0,"I bought the ""blood orange"" color to go along with the Pinch Me line of sheer gel cheek color in ""peach afterglow"" ... The colors look nice together. The lip stain could taste better. It is a roller tip, which I am not crazy about, but I like the stain because it isn't goopy like gloss and can look natural or applied in excess for a really robust color. I sometimes use it with Sally Hansen lip inflation for a pouty look. This review sounds like an ad, haha, I'll stop now."
212754,2,This product has a strong smell that is very unpleasant. The odor lingers. Maybe the one shipped to me had already gone rancid. I returned it.
243258,0,This is a good shampoo but I did not notice any difference in my red hair. It faded the way it always does.
147985,0,"They are ice quality tools and look just like the pic.................the only thing is I can't extract my blackheads and zits better with these then with my nails, in fact these leave more of a scar/mark then my fingers do!"
82866,1,I love this product I have used and shared it with others in my family. As an African American woman its nice to find a repair treatment product for our hair type that actually works.
200907,0,"I bought these for the blackheads on my nose and chin. It does work, but it is such a pain-at least for me-to sanitize them every time I want to use them (don't want to get an infection) and I find that it takes me longer to pop out blackhead. If you are very good at using these tools, then I think they are very durable and this pack had a great assortment of different ""pimple"" tools. On a side note: my son gets a large build up of wax in his ears-to the point I was taking him to the doctor to remove it every 3 months-I was a bit nervous doing it myself. After watching the doc do it, I decided to do it myself at home (saves a lot in doctors' bills). After my son gets out of shower, and ear wax is nice and soft, I use the tool with the open, hooked end. It gets the ear wax out great and I feel safe using it because the part that you hold is rough, so it won't slip, and the metal is medical grade and very smooth. Of course, if you are going to use this for ear wax, please confer with a doctor first. You can damage someones ears if not done properly."
39629,1,It heats up fast. Curls last 8+hours with proper care and style products. The cable does not get tangled up.
109368,0,"So i got my straightener yesterday afternoon. It arrived in 3 days, which was great. I love when items ship quicker than estimated. I plugged it up right away and tried it out. It does a great job of straightening my hair, but when i FIRST plugged it in, it started making a weird rattling/ticking noise and makes it the whole time the device is plugged in. I'm not sure if this is normal or if it means I received a somewhat defective piece. Anyone have any thoughts or experience the same noise upon first use of this product?"
107299,0,I wanted something that wasn't super sweet smelling i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn't as strong as the one I got here. But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.
98099,1,"I use Neutrogena Body Clear in lieu of other shower gel or soap rather than in combination with it. One thing I like about it is it takes much less of this scrub to be as effective as larger quantities some other body washes I've used - one bottle lasts several months for me. It is also much harder to squeeze out of the bottle. Once you get down to the end of the bottle, you have to pry off the cap to get it out - not exactly convenient. The odor is a little bit too sterile for my tastes, but it seems effective as an exfoliator and leaves me feeling clean. While it hasn't really combatted my minor body acne/KP that I can tell, it has kept it under control. I haven't found anything better in effectiveness or bang-for-buck in terms of shower gel or bar soap. I recommend it."
227973,0,"Can be used with dry or wet hair, but it's my first pass with my daughter and then I add Twig's leave-in conditioner. It doesn't seem to make the hair greasy or sticky when used when the hair is dry."
234394,0,"I have long, thick, wavy, and slightly frizzy hair. I am always on the look out for quality straighteners at a low price. I owned the Conair CS26JCS wet/dry straightener for about 6 months until it stopped heating up. Up until that point, I loved the straightener. I'm not sure how long this product says it's suppose to last but if it's used everyday, it's definitely not going to last you more than 6 months- not unless, you want to keep going over what you just straightened because it didn't hold."
7261,1,"The cream to powder foundation you are selling for the price of $13.50 is the old shape. The new shape is smaller & square and sells for $14.00. Why would a prson want to pay $13.50 for the old shape ? I would pay you 1/2 of that amount, want to make a deal ??"
120594,1,This product arrives on time and always delivers the results I'm looking for - I have ordered it several times and will continue.
109695,1,"I have recieved so many comments on this product,that were so wonderful that I didnt know how to reply to all of them. The name is kind of hard to pronounce. I knew it was me wearing this product that they were commenting about and it made me feel really good."
188691,1,"I love this stuff, it smells like 7-Up! It's not overly-drying and makes my skin feel so smooth and squeaky-clean. My only gripe (and I see I'm not alone) is that it doesn't come with a pump to get the product out. I'd figured my bottle was just missing that piece for some reason (I'd purchased it from Nordstrom Rack--a discount store), but now I see others reporting theirs didn't come with a pump either. Very strange, as it's difficult to get the correct amount of cleanser into your hand (especially in the shower) without a controlled pump. And the bottle looks like it was designed to be used in conjunction with a pump, so the whole no-pump thing is just weird. Whatever, it's still a 5-star product."
105288,2,I have used this product before and loved it. It did not seem like the same product. It smelled like Suave instead of the rich coconut smell I usually associate with this product. I will buy the product from a retail store or directly from Bumble and Bumble in the future.
204738,2,"The androstenone nonsense has been around since at least 2001 and not surprisingly internet marketers have cherry-picked science to make avery weak case for this derivative of testosterone to turn your average make ""6"" into Brad Pitt.B.S.The facts:The ability to even perceive the odor of androsterone is in all likelihood dictated by a single odorant receptor called OR7D4.Not all human being s are even capable of detecting this scent for reasons that are not yet fully understood.There are two variations of this receptor--RT/WM and RT/RT. Those individuals possessing the RT/RT genotype have been experimentallyproven to perceive androsterone as offensive: a foul urinous odor or one similar to heavy sweat. Those possessing the former genotype--RT/WMreport a less offensive odor, while a few suggest it similar to vanilla or a floral.The implication of the Rockefeller study is obvious: you can't know who can detect the scent or who will find it offensive or, conversely, slightly less offensive.Clearly, the suggestion that androsterone will attract women to men like moths to a flame is utter nonsense. It may very well be that even if you are drop-dead good lookingwith a body like a Greek God, the woman you're attracted to you may be one who gets a whiff of a urinal when you approach her; at the same time, if you connect with a woman""out of your league"" (you're a six and she's a nine) it could be because you're sitting next to her at a bar during the Super Bowl, you're both Patriot fans and they win a nail-biter in overtime.If she's with other girls (no boyfriend) she'll experience a rush of dopamine (The brain chemical that creates euphoria) which will give her a jolt of strong sexual feelings and you could,under those circumstances, suddenly look like a nine to her.The point: figure out a a way to get a girl to experience a dopamine rush and you're going to look a lot sexier to her."
30720,1,"I layered Pink Sugar and Lush's Karma perfume, which it heavy on bergomot and patchouli, it really brought the sweetness down. Real cotton candy scent on it's own. I love it but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age. I think mixing may be the only way to go with this one but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf."
16620,2,"I feel bad giving this a two star review, because scents are so personal in general. I did a blind buy of this, not having smelt it before. That was perhaps a mistake on my part, but typically I know what I like and am not disappointed. However, the smell to me is too powdery, too soapy, and too overpowering to really be enjoyable. If you love ""clean"" scents - then this might be the scent for you. It's extremely clean, and that is the dominant theme in the scent. In its defense, I personally find the smell more appealing after it settles on my skin for a few hours, but immediately after spraying it, I tend to find it to be overwhelming and overpowering. My personal opinion is that a scent should be defining and appealing, but not overpowering. I personally don't want people to smell me the moment I enter a room, but rather prefer that they notice the scent when they come closer. I personally just find this scent to be too one-note and dominant to be something I'd wear with any regularity. It's not offensive, it's just too much. But scents work different on everyone's body, so perhaps it's simply not the right fit for me. I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
6222,1,"This curling iron is pretty good, but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling. I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl. Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand. If you try to clamp your hair at the tip--it will not hold. You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold. But if you do that, and if you hair spray it first--this curler can make some excellent spirals. I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find. And this product does give me the curl I want, it just takes a little bit of finesse. But if you want something stronger and easier to use, look elsewhere."
90241,0,"the product is good and I love the products of this brand, but the price they charge for the office is very high, 50% of the value of the product, therefore, not recommended."
161125,0,"We found this product to have adequate coverage, but it goes on sticky and makes the skin feel tight. We even stuck to our towels after using it."
83707,2,"This purchase was my second bottle of Paris Hilton perfume, due to the fact that I absolutely LOVED my first bottle (probably my favorite scent). I was so disappointed when it arrived (I was anxiously counting the days), as it smells nothing like the bottle I bought at a department store a few years ago. It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch. It smells like most perfumes eventually do after sitting for some time- cheap and like rubbing alcohol. I would have sent it back, but Amazon does not allow for perfume returns. I am a frequent Amazon customer, yet this is my first time writing an Amazon review, so obviously I feel motivated to do so. For the first time, I am disappointed with Amazon. Shucks."
164613,1,"I read some of the other reviews. My advice: I mix the tinted product with a really creamy, fairly cheap moisturizer. That way it spreads really well, covers and protects my skin. I mix a bunch in a jar with a lid so I only have one cream to apply in the morning and go. Travels that way well also."
178858,2,"I bought a bottle of this back in the late '90s and always got compliments on it. My then girlfriend now wife loved it. Unfortunately Nautica stopped making it so I switched to other colognes. When I found this on Amazon I was quick to pick it up, but unfortunately this is not the same scent. Nowhere near as good."
78266,0,"Sounds a little rickety and rattling right out of the dirty box... I expect it to break soon, as most of these hot air contraptions do... Sounds like there is something in the fan..."
159313,0,"First of all, I love to use Goldwell Ultra Rich Conditioner to treat my hair. This product restores vibrant health to even the most deeply damaged hair and sets the hair back to its original stage. It dramatically helps increas strength against breakage. Normally, after 2-3 treatment, my hair has a shiny healthy look. My hair was never soft but this product give my hair a sleek look that I don't have to spend time to straight or style except comb my hair in the morning after shower.Second, a small bottle goes a long way. My previous 1 liter bottle last a very very long time. I don't know if they have expiration date but after a year, the quality of the product still very good.I was disappointed for my recent purchase from ASAP Beauty. The conditioner came out very watery and it doesn't have the magic effect on my hair any more. My hair went puffy and curly at the second day after the treatment.I am not sure if the company changed its formula or just something wrong with this bottle but I will give the product another try from a different seller."
125241,1,the towels were great for my daughter before her prom. We started using them 2 weeks before and she looked amazing. Forget the tanning salons
51351,1,"This scent has a tropical appeal to it. My wife is making me write this review. Seriously, this is a winner."
189924,2,"After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes that Grandpa's Pine Tar soap would help with my psoriasis, but after using almost daily for 3 weeks, I can't say it helped all that much if any at all. If anything I would say that the soap leaves the skin feeling dry, and I found myself using more lotion to compensate, but would still end up itchy towards the end of the day. Psoriasis is a weird thing though, so you may have better results.Like the other reviews note, the odor is very strong and takes some getting use to, but it is not entirely offensive either. Kinda manly actually, and not too dissimilar from the smell of coal tar shampoo."
225759,1,Buy this item in sets or in bulk - priced better. Soap lasts a long time and is larger in size than your normal bath-size soap bar! Great scent! Great to give to your man as a gift!
237802,2,"I used to use this soap until I found out the company uses palm oil. Palm oil production is pushing orangutans to near extinction in violent and painful ways. I'd like to use this product if they would use an oil that isn't harmful to wildlife. Sidenote: ""sustainable"" palm oil is a green washing term. If you go to my profile, I advise where to get more info."
93932,2,"This stuff is just ok. It smells nice. It gets hard when it dries, kind of like hair gel, if you use too much. I'm not sure it really makes the Toppik fibers stick better, or if it makes it so you don't have to use as much. If it does, I can't really tell a difference from when I don't use it. I purchased this stuff a year and a half ago, and I still have it."
157972,2,the bottle I got was smaller then the bottle that i ordered. As you can see the bottle is already pretty small. So you can understand how upset I am to get something smaller
233244,1,Very good product and love the color. It is almost clear polish with sparkles - great for holidays to add a little shimmer. I am allergic to formaldehyde and it's great to finally find a polish that doesn't contain this ingredient.
9402,1,"This is the BEST wide tooth comb I have ever used! I have thick fine textured hair that breaks easily, especially when wet. I use my Mason Pearson Rake Comb to detangle my hair when wet and in the morning to get the knots out. Unlike other, cheaper wide tooth combs, this one eliminates almost all static, has smooth teeth that don't scratch the scalp, and the plastic does not peel off (which can increase hair breakage). I would highly recommend it for delicate thick hair or for coarse or curly hair that's hard to comb.The price is relatively expensive for a comb but WELL WORTH it!"
153136,0,I have been using polo black for years now and travel a lot so I was looking for a small size bottle to travel with. I found a 1.3 oz bottle on the website. When it arrived it was only a 1 oz bottle. Was upset since this isn't a cheap cologne. Not worth sending it back so I guess I'm gonna eat the cost and suck it up. Guess shipping the correct order is too difficult these days.
57206,0,"This product made my skin smoother, just like it claimed. It's much thicker than other body washes and lathers well. The scent could be better. The aroma isn't bad, just not really good either. It smelled similar to fabric softener. This is a gentle, lotion-like body wash. It's not a body scrub, so if you want exfoliation, you have to use a loofa or bath scrubber with it."
134276,1,My wife used this Chi everyday....the GF3000 N Ceremic Iron Hair Dryer with Nano Technology is by far her favorite of all time~! Thanks again.
243847,1,"I have extremely sensitive skin so I was hesitant about purchasing this product after I read the negative reviews. I found that the first night I put on the white gel (kind of looks like cream) my skin was soft and smooth and all pimples that had started forming were gone. I made the mistake of putting it on again in the morning... SO much burning and my face became bright red and puffy so I applied lotion to ease the tingling, burning sensation. By the end of the day, my face was super dry (and still is 2 days later) but I haven't formed any more acne and my face, though dry, is bright and soft. As long as I use this product once a week, I think it will work perfectly! Also, I haven't noticed any bleaching, as many of the reviewers have, but I'm trying to be very careful and not wear dark clothing when I sleep with it on my face."
241607,0,"Well, I was excited to get the thickening conditioner that I used years ago but when I got it it didn't smell as strong as I remember. I can't smell the lemon sage scent and I was looking forward to it. The product does the job but doesn't have the scent so I was wondering if the product may be old."
247568,2,"This is no good at all. Streaks and uneven paint. As much as I tried to make this look good it would just not do it. I have been doing my own nails for years so I know a good product. It's is cheap, poorly made nail polish. It makes your nails look like you painted them with pink chalk. Do not buy this."
224918,0,"The things I like about this hair dryer are the convenient speed and heat switches (it has 3 settings available for each) and the size. It is shorter than majority of the hair dryers, which makes it easier to use on the short hair. Also the bigger nozzle delivers more air flow, speeding up the drying process.So why only 3 starts? First of all, it does not deliver on the ""quiet"" part and is as noisy as all my previous hair dryers. Second, the concentrator attachment, which is a vital accessory for styling, does not stay in place and falls off easily. After falling several times on the bathroom floor, it cracked and the ring that is supposed to connect it to the nozzle, fell apart piece by piece, making the attachment useless.Also it seems to have the same problem as many other hair dryers: after less than a year of use the ""hot"" setting became too hot and now I'm down to ""warm or nothing""."
26661,1,"I have very thin, dry hair and this product made my hair look and feel fabulous! It is pricey but worth every drop! I wil always keep this product in my shower. You do not need a conditioner and just a tiny amount goes a long way."
171160,1,"This hairdressing is mostly petrolatum and olive oil. What does that mean? It means that it is shiny, VERY shiny. I'm talking sheen like you've never seen. It also means that unlike normal petrolatum pomades (e.g. Murray's) this will wash out in only one shower. You will still need a strong detergent shampoo like Dax Removing or just some plain dishsoap, but it will come out. The downside, of course, is the hold. It just isn't very strong. I have seen some water-based pomades with hold like this, although they don't have the same texture and they certainly don't have the same shine.Bottom line, if you have long hair and want to sport a big pompadour or something of that ilk then this is not for you, stick with Murray's. However, if you have shorter hair and want something that has the look and feel of a petrolatum pomade, but something you can still wear everyday and wash out at night, then Royal Crown might just be for you."
198191,0,"Flat iron works fine, but did not appear to be in brand new shape. Would not make another purchase from this supplier."
99458,1,"This is my daughter-in-law's favorite perfume. It has a luscious, heavenly scent that is not too overpowering. Perfect for someone who works with the public on a daily basis, as she does. Makes a very nice gift. She was happy!"
234499,2,"I have been a person struggling with acne the past three years and I thought maybe I wasn't thoroughly washing my face well enough, so I thought a scrubbing brush would be able to go deeper inside and get the impurities out. I've used this product for about two weeks, and I absolutely no difference in complexion or tone. I still have the blackheads on my nose. This product really costs a whole lot for something that doesn't really do what it says it will do. I gave it two stars simply because I'm sure it cleans, it just doesn't clean any better than your hands would."
167684,0,"I bought this makeup kit for horse shows so I don't have to swap around makeup back and forth. Coming with mascara, blush, powder, eyeliner, lipgloss, and eyeshadow, it fit my needs very well. The makeup is good quality, and the eyeshadows are good colors.But, when it arrived, the top cover of it was unattached, and I have to use tape to keep it in place.Overall, this is a very good product, and if your looking for an all-in-one travel makeup case, it should fit your needs perfectly."
202401,1,I used this on my first pregnancy and I did not get any stretch mark. I used twice a day and I love it.
28033,0,This product is great for what I had to buy it for. I forgot my blow dryer and knew it would be cheaper to get it on amazon prime than buy one at cvs.I have no real complaints since I paid less than $15 for it.I would not buy this product if you have long hair. My hair seems to always get tangled in the dryer when I use it - and that is really quite frustrating. I wish I had paid more and purchased one that had a slightly longer barrel.
143421,0,The color I purchased was the same NAME as other Covergirl foundation but a totally darker shade. Disappointing. Smelled good though.
201585,0,I just had my toe digits done and was a little disappointed. The Pink look in the bottle is not what landed on my toes. More of a beigy look. Can anyone suggest a another color for me. I tried Vanity too and the same thing.
224987,1,"excellent all very well, arrived in perfect condition 100% recommended, all very good, especially for women very good and special"
67362,1,"I first smelled this when standing in a group of classmates, when I casually said, ""Someone smells good."" One of the men stepped forward and asked if it was him, and it was. He said it was Kenneth Cole Reaction. A few days later, I sat next to him in the library, going over notes. Once I smelled his cologne, I forgot everything I was trying to teach him and sat there stumbling over words like an idiot. I'm not a very sexual person, and I was never attracted to him before, but this cologne made me melt in my shoes. I don't think he knew why I was sitting there blushing, and it was all I could think about for the rest of the evening."
19316,1,"I absolutely love bare minerals products. I am 26 and have been living with acne prone skin since puberty. I use to use liquid foundation and then a powder, which was the only way to get full coverage. But then I tried the bare minerals and thought for sure it wouldnt be enough for my skin type but sure enough it covered completely, and feels so much better on my skin. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, to anyone!!!!!!!!!"
147414,0,"What I ordered and what I received were two different products. I ordered Biosilk Finishing Spray Firm Hold - Hair Spray and received CHI Flex Hold Firm Hold Hair Spray. I chose not to return the product received because I thought I might as well try it, the price paid ended up a great sale for the amount of hair spray in the can. The CHI Flex Hold Hair Spray does not hold the hair style for as long a period of time as the Biosilk Firm Hold. I should have made contact with the seller to see why the product was switched or if the other product was no longer being manufactured. I will still make future purchases from Amazon.com and possibly this seller."
17845,1,Was looking for this item for years and was so happy to finally find it! It is great stuff for hair that is very damaged and can't get a comb through it! Nothing out there is like this miracle stuff and I have tried it all!!!!!!!! Could not find it in any stores for a very long time! St Ives has always made great products!
114861,0,"It's an okay conditioner, but for me not fabulous. It does a fine job of moisturizing, and it smells nice . I like the texture, and all, but it just doesn't quite do IT for me, not enough to spend the money on this product. I don't detest it like Creme de Coco, nor love it like the Color Support or Pureology's Nanoworks. I will get through this bottle, and most likely not repurchase.It isn't quite hydrating enough, and it doesn't give my hair as much shine and movement as I like. Like I say it's ok, but not my HG.It does no harm.... I have highlighted, long, wavy hair, that is pretty healthy despite all those things."
201742,2,"This nail polish is a good one. But I was expecting more of it. First of all, I say it is very expensive so I thought it would be a great quality, I wanted it for french nails. but for my suprise it came to my house with a thick consistency. I don't know if all essey nail polish are like this, but this was my first essey nail polish and all I can say is that I prefer buying the inexpensive revlon I have always buyed."
10723,2,"One look into this 5X magnification bathroom mirror told me how poor its quality is. The wavy image of my face looking back reminded me of a funhouse mirror. Price-wise, this is a very cheap mirror, especially for its large size, but the cheapness of its glass makes it a very poor purchase, indeed."
170361,0,"you can't tell from the photo that this is a sparkly color... but i figured i'd keep it for a halloween costume or some crazy night out. the shade of blue is really nice, just wish it was not full of glitter"
36089,2,"I got this product in ""Liquid Kiss"" and it was a dark red/brown on me. It would not stain my lips properly and I had to put a ton of it on just to get the color to look even on them, which resulted in that dark red/brown color. I'm not picky about shades normally, but this one just looked gross on me. I am white with dark hair and goldenish skin. I would consider trying another shade if I could find this product locally and try it on my skin before spending $20+ on it. Yet, I suspect I'd have to put so much on, it'd be gone quick and I'm way too thrifty to buy a stain every 3 seconds. Overall, just not for me."
9298,0,"I like the set up and quick heating and velvet covered rollers. However, the clips are not very snug and on top of that they leave indentations in your hair. I will try another kind, this is my first experience with hot rollers, and for now I'm back to my trusty revlon ceramic heat curling iron I've used for 12 yrs!!"
182351,0,"I liked this product but not as good as some of the other china glaze ones, it just didn't glide on as well.."
220815,1,"No need to overpay for a department-store brand when this powder does the job as well or better, unless you are into impressing people with what's on your dressing table. Over the years, I've bought many different brands but always come back to the Coty loose power in translucent.Use it to set your foundation, over your moisturizer, or over nothing. It will control oil and it never feels heavy or gets cakey. A little dusting on your eyelashes makes them look longer and fuller after you apply mascara. It will tone down a little too much blush. It makes your skin feel soft and smooth. All in all, you're not going to find a better powder for your money."
53952,2,"Do not waste your time and your money on this product. The metal clips are completely awful and do not hold your hair at all, the end up falling right out. Then when you finally get them to stay, after much frustration, they poke at your scalp to the point where it is unbareable for them to remain in any longer. The curlers do not reach a high heat, and therefore do not curl your hair. I kept the curlers in for about 25 minutes, and when I took them out, my hair was exactly the same."
82750,0,This perfume smells good but some of the other ones from burberry are far better than this one. Try the Brit Sheer.
131825,1,"Clears up any diaper rash or bump within a day and can be used for scrapes, dry skin or chapped lips. Great on dry elbows, too. I've used it for years for myself and now for my baby. Stock up on the 3-pack - it's a great value!"
202685,0,"I bought it after a magazine beauty editor raved about it. I love the idea of combining moisturizer, sunscreen and foundation, voila - tinted moisturizer. But I was disappointed. It did not provide as good a coverage as Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. May be if you have flawless, porcelain skin it will work well. It just did not work well on my oily skin."
114378,1,This product is one of the few that actually stopped my hairfall completely. I might see maybe a couple strands falling in the shower or on my pillow but overall it has reduced if not almost diminished my hairfull. The claims that it regrows hair I am doubting as I have not seen any new patches of growth but it is an awesome system to maintain what you have!!
69537,2,"[[ASIN:B000184Z1G Adagio Marketing ShowerTek WV2 The Original Fog Free Shower Mirror]I have owned this in the past and not been satisfied, but when it was the only one available on Amazon with the features I wanted, I got it again and now it's worse than the first one I owned. The first one was only a pain to try to clean and the mirror is not receptive to normal cleaners and gets spotty. The new one has leaks at some of the connection spots and squirts out of the valve switch when the flow of water is opened to de-fog the mirror. So, great, I can shave but now either my walls, floors, or ceiling will be soaked, depending on how I position the bendable arm mount (which, again, also leaks depending on how you bend it)."
49529,1,"I don't know how I have put up with tube after tube of dry, orangey, overly bright or just plain drab lipsticks that clutter up my drawers and purses. Now that I have found NARS Dolce Vita I will never need another. It is creamy soft, feels incredibly smooth and moisturizing, and offers just a hint of color. More than just a &#34;nude,&#34; the color goes with probably 98% of everything I wear. Love, love, love it!"
158119,2,I ordered this hair dyer because I have had two before (which keep overheating) and couldn't find the same on in any stores but have always liked it. When turned on It smells horrible!!! Like it has been stored in a musty basement for years!!!
240014,0,"This product returns to the age old debate: healthy hair vs killer style. This product is better for your hair. The fabric is much softer on your hair than metal plates, and I could tell a difference in the shine/softness of my hair.However, for me the fabric created it's own problem. Friz. Every time I'd release the pates it looked, well, like I had ran fabric over my hair. Also, although the straightener gets nice and hot, it had problems with my thick and wavy hair.Overall the product is not bad per se. It just depends where your priorities are when looking for a styling product."
115231,1,"Easy to use, quick melting pellets, nice soft scent, I will buy this product again."
60443,1,"This is my 2nd favorite nail polish color, the first is OPI's Natasha &Boris. This one is great cause its super light, I would call it a ballerina pink. Looks great with one coat or two."
223390,2,"Do NOT buy this product. Really a big disappointment... I bought few of these products for my mom and cousins. It turned out that they have the same impression about the product. The fragrance / scent only last for a few minutes. Even if they tried to use more, the scent didn't last longer. BEWARE!!! NOT recommended!!!"
85241,0,I bought two of these. One for each of my sons. They both liked the product but the brush stand arrived broken in one and on the other the brush was unstable (kept tipping) and fell.
80914,0,"Since the packaging looked dubios, I am not sure if this is an original. I am hoping that it is.It sure smells like it. But i was a little disappointed that it was NOT a perfectly packaged box."
208156,2,Mild fragrance but VERY disappointing that it takes so much product to get the &#34;foam&#34; to wash during a shower. I won't buy more.
18147,0,"Before this brush I would not even attempt to run a comb through my thick, natural curls. After watching fellow naturals on YouTube I decided to give it a try. While I love that I can actually brush my hair easily, it definitely takes lots of victims with it. I have a lot more breakage with the Denman than with my wide-tooth comb. I love how the Denman cuts through my naps and clumps my curls but the breakage is too much. I started detangling with my comb and then following with the Denman...same results, less breakage, longer time spent in the shower."
36789,0,"Lilac is a difficult scent to reproduce. This soap was not really as fragrant as I had hoped. And the scent it had was just a bit ""off"". I'm sure the soap will be fine in use, but I was hoping for something that would remind me of the lilac bush I once had. This one really doesn't do that.The packaging was very nice. It makes a nice presentation for giving as a gift."
220085,1,I have two young girls that hated to have their hair brushed because it hurt. With this brush I can send them off to do it themselves. It's gets tangles out without hurting them. I don't have to put their hair up in buns all the time to hide the tangles :)
76211,0,"I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can't see any difference in my skin at all. I used this in combination with the Mychelle Clear Skin serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts. I wish I could report different results!Also - my bottle had a faulty dispenser in that the pumping tube was much shorter than the botte, so a good portion of the product would not come out. Unfortunately, I did not realize this at first -- I just thought the product was gone already -- it is a very small bottle -- but I was using only 2 small pumps per application, so I was really surprised it didn't last longer. Thinking it was empty, however, I unscrewed the pump and dumped the bottle energetically into my hand, to get out the last few expensive drops ... only to have th product GUSH into my hand and run down the drain. Ouch.The product didn't seem to be working for me, anyway -- But I hope my warning will keep you from experiencing the same [expensive!] loss."
54269,0,"I like the shampoo, but it is too much money"
178415,0,I had purchased one of these devices back in 2006 it is designed on the scientific basis that lasers regrow hair however finding how simple and common the lasers were in these devices I found I could build a more powerful device with about 10 times as many lasers for about 100 dollars. The lasers are 350 Nano meter that just means they are red and they have the power of a laser pointer so you could build this device for about 100 bucks and a trip to radio shack. Do your homework it is easy other than that great product.
3847,0,"For the price I wish there was more to go around. It's a really small amount in each jar. I am already out... but over all it's ok, I have yet to see any imporvement but again I only had ONE jar so far, I am thinking about buying another one, but not sure yet.KEEP IN COOL TEMP AT ALL TIMES MELTS IN HEAT."
251284,0,I haven't decided yet if I'm keeping this item or not. Some of the clips seem to be a little too large for the roller so sometimes the rollers don't stay in place. I would like less of the large rollers and more of the small and medium ones. So I'm still holding judgment on this set. It is hard to find a set similar and I've been using this type for many years. I've tried other types to no avail. I did like that a couple extra rollers were added.
56408,2,"I ordered two (2) 3.4 Oz. Paloma Picasso but the wrong size 1.7 Oz. was shipped and received. I contacted your company but they said they could not ship the correct size until I return the wrong order that was shipped. I asked your company to just ship me the correct order in the meantime, that it was your mistake not mine and that you had my money. They said they could not and I would have to wait on a refund (that would take about 6-weeks) I really got upset and told them that it did not take them but 1 1/2 days to take it out of my account and that it better not take them 6 weeks to get it back into my account. Had to return the wrong products shipped and received my refund promptly after your company received their products back. I had told them to just ship me the correct product order and they said they could not that I would have to get the refund.Ordered from ebay!"
233107,1,"I got this color for free from zoya.com to celebrate the 4th of July. It is amazing! I only put one coat on and it was all I needed, virtually unheard of in the world of nail polish today! I won't say all of Zoya's products are as great because I've not tried them but this is a winner to me. They now have a loyal customer in me!"
238454,0,"The product itself was fine, but the shipping charges made a $4 item cost $14. Next time I will check before I buy with One-Click shopping."
143595,2,"This isn't so much a review of the product as it is a warning to all you guys buying for your sweetheart.I purchased this being fairly sure that her perfume was ""Beautiful"", and also fairly confident in Amazon's return policy if I was wrong. My bad, she wears ""Miracle"" and Amazon won't take this back.So I'm not so happy getting another one of those $77 lessons....to double check before ordering (even if it means letting her know what you are buying)! And if anyone needs a bottle of Beautiful, I have one I'll let it go cheap."
193989,0,"I love the color of this polish. It's bright and unique and complimentary to most skin tones [I would imagine]. However, the texture of it sucks. It has glitter, and it makes it really hard to apply smoothly and evenly. It's pretty thick. Getting it off is impossible, you have to use 100% acetone. With that being said, it doesn't really chip easily and stays on well."
249685,0,"Update (2012): I have been using this for over half a year now. I really enjoy this product, but the motor has decreased significantly. I still use it for microdermabraison once a week, but I hardly ever use it to scrub my face anymore because I feel like it's not doing anything. I received the clairsonic in July and I have to admit that I prefer it significantly over the dermanew.Initial review:You haven't really cleansed your face until you've used this product. At first I thought it was useless because it didn't feel like it was even cleaning my face, but once I washed and touched my skin afterwards my opinion changed. My face is baby-smooth after I used this two days in a row. I use acne-wash in the morning and the Dermanew cleanser for oily skin at night. I got a chance to use the microdermabraison wash last night and I think I see a decrease in my scars already. I can't wait to see what my face will look like in a couple of weeks.Update: I've been using this for a couple of months now and it really helps fight my adult acne. I went two weeks without using it and my acne got doubly worse. The mircodermabraison works fairly well. The scars have decreased slightly, but they are still visible on my jaw line."
49620,0,I did not like the smell of it too flowery for my taste it smells like some cheap imitations i've sampeled in the far east quite a disapointment .
119988,0,"I love Maybelline - almost all my make-up is from them, and everything they make has always worked fantastically for me, and looks beautiful, but this was a bit of a disapointment.I wasn't expecting humongous lashes when I tried this, but it didn't make my eyelashes look any longer than they do when I use Great Lash mascara (another mascara brand by Maybelline which is THE BEST). It did look fine, though, just not what I was hoping for.And then when I tried to take it off....geez. Took out at least 5 lashes on each of my eyes, and I'm gentle when I take mascara off! If you have naturally long, thick lashes that grow quickly it may not be much a disaster, but I'm not like that, so that doesn't go too well with me."
222929,0,"Last time I used a L'Oreal was about 5 years ago - with younger skin so no complain, I guess. After that I have been pretty much with Kiehl's and RoC. Back to L'oreal this one, somehow I feel it comes with small particles. and a few times it peels off like srcub masks. Not sure if it's me - using wrong lotion underneath or... just the way this product is."
78444,0,"I bought this product because I started losing my hair due to harsh chemicals with other products so I liked the fact that this product didn't have any PPD, Peroxide, and Amonia which I thought it would help with my hair loss but it didn't. I've tried it for a few months now, and every time I put it on, my hair gets really dry and starts falling out again. However, it does give me a nice tint and highlights my grays, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have hair-loss problems."
60980,2,"DISAPPOINTED WITH OPPOSITE RESULTS. DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT DISCRIBED & I ALWAYS USE THIS SAME COLOR. INSTEAD OF LESS BRASSY BLOND , I NOW HAVE RED! TRYING FOR REFUND..."
148713,2,Terrific product that really does what it purports to do. Leaves your skin literally sparkling! I use it on my face s well as body. Has a minty feel and smell. It is good to use an exfoliation particularly if you are using a self tanner. The only reason I gave this product a 2* is because I found it at Macy's website (same size) for $22. That is a significant difference in price!I was surprised because I usually buy at amazon because I have prime and I usually get a better deal but it is always a good idea to check prices elsewhere.
227404,2,"It does make my hair shinier than any other product on the market so far, BUT the scent is absolutely horrible and the scent stays on my hair for days. Also it is greasy, not creamy & after using I have to wash my hands, not only to get the grease off but to get the scent off. I've emailed the company about the scent & they just sent me a free coupon for another VO5 product & said their product had been tested for years. But I wonder who tested the scent? Not women who would be using it!"
42282,0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
25320,0,"This make-up comes out very thick, and if you follow the instructions you end up with a blob of make-up surrounding your hairline. I try and mix it on my palm with some face lotion, but still it is very thick. Not a good product for anyone who wants light to medium coverage."
64223,0,"They work awesome. My wrinkles were GONE overnight. However, the pad is too small to cover my chest and they only last 10-15 days instead of the 30-60 promised.That was a huge disappointment as they are not cheap."
141152,0,"This eye cream is amazing. i love the duality. however, the instructions came in another language so I had to do research to figure how to use the product correctly."
150827,2,"I have dark circles around my eyes, and was looking for something that actually worked, also on a permanent basis, as this product describes.I was so excited when a person told me how this product works, and of course I read about it also in these reviews. I threw a hundred dollars in the garbage so to speak and was so disappointed. It did absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing! I gave it one star for the delivery and packaging, but what a waste of money!"
5713,0,"The coverage on this could be a tad better, but its a nice alternative to full make up. As a coverup, I'd say no."
79872,0,"I bought this because I wanted to give my eyes a little extra moisture, but I'm 20 so I don't need anything for wrinkles yet. This gel feels nice. It goes on smoothly and cools (especially if you keep it in the fridge!). Sinks in well so that make-up goes on over it without a problem. My eyes don't look/feel any different after using it for awhile. Then again, I don't have many problems in the eye area to begin with. On the plus side, it lasts FOREVER. Great gel for a little extra moisture, but doesn't do much in the brightening/dark circles department."
75450,0,"I absolutely love this fragrance on my wife. Problem is it doesn't last, otherwise this would be a 5 star handsdown."
222758,2,"I ordered the product 8 weeks ago. It still hasn't arrived. After so many emails with the company, they would not send out a new one to replace it or give me a refund. They told me I have to download a refund form and POST IT IN TO THEM! I asked could I scan or fax and they said NO! Every update I got was only a generic email and they said for me to do all the follow up with USPS. I will not use this company again. The product I have used many times and it is great!"
223341,0,I don't know if this is the real thing but I find that the scent diminishes fast. Maybe I got a bad one but I usually like Elizabeth Ardens perfumes.
153310,0,"This cleanser gets the job done. Yet, most cleansers do. I do notice a difference when I use it with my Clarisonic. But, that is probably the Clarisonic and not so much the Vitamin C cleanser. I will go back to the Murad clarifying cleaner which leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and glowing. I don't know why I switched in the first place. You know us girls, we're always looking for something new to try."
20687,0,I used to relax my hair a lot but now i just straighten it. I would recommend and buy again if need be in the future!
223461,1,"OPI is one of the best and longest lasting nail lacquers on the market. I love the vividness of the colors they offer especially this one. They are long lasting, on my toes they last about 2 weeks without chipping and a week and a half on my hands. Thats without a top or base coat by the way. The picture shown is very accurate for Linoln Park after Dark, it is a beautiful color."
104206,2,I ordered this product from a seller on Amazon (Khanh Hoang Mai) to only find out that it was either watered down or mixed with another solution. I say this because I bought the same exact product from Smart Styles in Walmart and it was very strong and creamy and now my hair has shine and body since purchasing from Smart Styles.
72361,0,"I bought this perfume before, but this time I thought the scent very weak. But the quality of fragancy is very sweet and the womens love it."
221376,2,"I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't as effective in clearing up my son's eczema as CeraVe. I did purchase 2 orders to give it a fair try. The second order had leaked out during shipping (about 25% of the product). On a positive note, I do like the thick consistency and the pump dispenser. However, for the price and effectiveness, I prefer other products."
72546,0,"This flat iron spray is a great deal. However, it left my hair really greasy and I would not over spray or anything and I also felt like it was not doing anything. If you want to save money I recommend it, if you are looking for high quality, you should keep looking."
54431,0,"My daughter was disappointed that there were only three scents to work with. She thought the spa part of it was geared towards older kids, but they would not have as much fun with the perfume making. Overall she thought it was ok just not very versatile."
245305,1,"I bought this cream to use on myself and my 11 month old son who has eczema. I wish I would've discovered it sooner! It's a great cream. Not too greasy in my opinion. It leaves his skin feeling like baby skin again. I find it superior to Eucerin or Aquaphor. Rubs in well, also."
168656,0,"The tube is correctly labeled for LIGHT natural brown. However, the color comes out a very dark brown. If this is truly their idea of light brown, then I would have to order a blond color to get light brown. Ordered two tubes, so am hoping the other tube is an ACTUAL light brown color."
175153,1,My wife absolutely loves this foundation. It is the same quality if not better as much more expensive brands and gives the same look and cover. Fantastic product line and I'm happy with the price....:)
209133,0,"I bought this on Amazon and I have been using it for a week now.I must stay it is an effective cleanser for oily acne prone skin (which is what I have).However, it is costly and sometimes I feel like I have to cleanse my face twice, especially when I wear sun screen so I am using it a lot more then other cleansers I had and leaves my skin dry. I wouldn't recommend it to dry or normal skin.That being said, however, the skin feels really clean, squeaky clean.Also, the skin feels refreshed but when it goes near your eye (not even in the eye, but NEAR), it really stings.Would I buy it again? maybe. I can use this 2-3 times a week but not as a regular cleaner. Also, given the price point, I can find better products that will last longer."
48821,0,"While these are well made products, they are not worth the money. Nothing special here, but does get it's job done."
249366,0,"I picked this color because I am working on going back to my natural color. This dark blonde turned out more of a light brown. Still not a bad color, just not what I was going for. Oh, and the color holds very well, it's been 3 weeks since I colored it and hardly any change!"
11952,2,I love the smell of lemongrass but this was a little overwhelming and the soap seemed to dissolve away to quickly. Lathered up nice and left skin feeling good but fragrance was to strong for me.
133886,2,I got it a couple weeks ago and left it in my roots for an hour. I swear it was half washed out after the first wash 2 days later. A week after and my roots were nothing more than tinted pink. Highly disappointed. I think I'll stick with N'Rage :/
43592,2,this product didn't protect my skin under the sun. I used once then threw it away!
26955,1,"Item came as expected, very prompt delivery! Can't go wrong with this burberry perfume...i would definitely recommend it to anybody. This bottle is huge too!"
181335,1,"After searching for this at the mall (Penney's, I believe) for a shade over $90, we decided to check online. Very impressed with the price (less than half of what Penney's priced it at), the checkout was simple, and the delivery very speedy."
53130,1,"I bought this because I needed to cover gray roots of my permanently colored hair.I wanted something gentle as my hair is fragile. I put a small amount on the roots and combed through. It blended the color nicely and even covered some gray. It is hard to find non-permanent color these days, so I was glad to find this."
36286,0,"The product was as ordered and arrived in good condition, however I thought I was paying for expidited 2 day shipping and as the item was shipped on the tuesday before Mothers Day and as it was a gift for Mothers Day I was disappointed when it took 5 days to arrive, the day after Mothers Day."
250603,0,"I bought this item from Sally's Beauty Supply, in Jan of 2011 it is now May 2011, and the lights don't work at all, like others I had a hard time trying to figure out how to get the bulbs out. Since I bought this at the store I never read any reveiws before hand. I was going to replace it until I read the more recent reveiws which explained how to get the back off, it was difficult at first but I soon got the hang of it. Like others I did break something (the slider) but I don't use it anyway, so that being said I can now replace the bulbs myself. Now I don't need to throw the mirror away or replace it. I only gave it 3 stars because it should have been easier to replace bulbs."
176395,0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying perfume online, especially since this one have different reviews. So I researched the perfume from other web sites as well and it had ok kind of reviews so I bought it and they were right it does smell good."
12618,1,"I've been using this product for a week now and I noticed a big improvement in my skin. The red marks are fading and no pimples.But I do want to mention that I did a test on myself before I start using this product. I read an article how dairy food can cause acnes because of the antibotics that are injected in the cows to product more milk. The anitbotics are like pregnant hormones, so when you eat dairy food, your body thinks you're pregnant and cause your hormones to go out of balance.So I did a test to see if it's true. I had no dairy food for 2 weeks and what a difference I saw in my face. I noticed right away no more development of new pimples or cysts. Then I decided to go back to dairy food again. I started breaking out again. From then on, I cut out dairy food and I haven't had another pimple again. But I had another problem. The scars and red marks are still there.This is when I found FOTE from T-tapp website. Once I started using this product, I noticed the red marks fading immediately and my skin seems more smooth. I use this every night as a mask and wash it off with St. Ives Apricot Scrub (oil free only). My skin would look radiant and healthy in the morning.I would definitely recommend this product to help the red marks and scars on your face but do try testing yourself to see if dairy food is also another problem that is causing your acne."
83877,0,"Hmm I ordered this and received it within three to four days i don't remember.. But anyways, I have been using this product for a week now and haven't seen no changes.. my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before.. I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I'm 20 I don't bite them as often they're just short.. I hope I see progress soon or I'm going to be upset.. that this product was all hype smh.."
39817,1,"I added this to my rotation due to its striking difference from the majority of the scents I wear. Its very nice. I hesitate to speculate what is actually in the scent, but it is certainly distinct in a pleasant way."
211473,1,"It is not a scent you run across everyday, it has a bold musk wood smell...but it grows on you. If u want an unique odor that's not too loud but will make a guy turn his head to see whose wearing it, this is your scent."
92472,0,"I am 29 years old. I will say, this fragrance is possibly more suited to a more mature adult. The fragrance is very true to the scent of an actual rose...but...there is a tinge of, something. Sorta smells like, nail polish remover somehow. I wouldnt return it at all, its an OK, prefume. But I wont be a repeat customer for Tea Rose. :-("

202148,1,"The stores where I live don't carry this hair gel any more, so I have been without it for a few years. I was so happy to have found this gel on Amazon. It is amazing the soft curls this gel gives my hair. The gel doesnt leave my hair sticky or ""crispy"" and it holds my curls all day long. Ihave more compliments on my hair when I use this product as compared to other products. Hands down, this is the best gel for curly hair that I have ever found!"
76594,2,"At first, it did not smell like I remembered it to do. Went to a Duty free store and try the original and it is completely different smell that the one I purchased.Will not return cause I have used it already, but it seems to be fake! !"
118104,2,"#1. It has FARMALDEHUYDE ! Per WebMD: ""Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate.""#2. How on earth does putting this on top of the nailpolish penetrate the nailpolish to strengthen the nail under it?! It doesn't! That just goes to prove that it's the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it's actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.I was shocked when i put it on to see that it's basically just clear nail polish and not something that penetrates the nail it's self to strengthen it! It's just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!)."
85382,2,Do not order this if you think that based upon the reviews this is the product to stop sucking thumbs. I mistakenly read the reviews and didn't look at the product and was shipped nail polish
139665,0,"For those of you who know the wonderful fragrance of Freesia flowers, you will be disappointed by this spray. I have tried many scents and cannot find one to match the flowers in my garden. This spray does not smell much like the flower, however it does have a lovely fragrance."
9000,2,I bought this for my daughter and at first it was great. Her face had broken out really bad and it one day it cleared up 50% better by the 3day it was barely noticeable. Then one night we started noticing bumps on her face. We just thought it was because she put make up on that day so she washed her face off. Well the next day her faces was covered in bumps and red and puffy. Not to mention it was itching and she felt like her face was on fire. She even got sick. Not sure if it was from her red inflamed face but DONT try it. She has NEVER broke out from anything until now!! So dont think it wont happen to you because you have not had allergic reactions to anything. Well think again......Dont waste your money. Unless you like having rash on your face instead of pimples!!!
10655,1,I am really enjoying this product. It is just like the ones you find in the store but not so expensive. Have used it a least 2 times and my skin feels great.
111740,2,"When I received this product in the mail I was very excited to use it. Unfortunately, after the first use of the product, I was very unsatisfied. The product turns on and off while I am using it, therefore making it defective. I contacted the seller and told them of this problem to try to receive a different one and they responded with that I would be responsible for all the shipping costs. After purchasing this thru that seller, I will never purchase another Vidal Sassoon product again and nothing thru that seller again."
76458,1,Mom was amazed that Amazon carries her all-time favorite Revlon color after all these years. I think it's the perfect pale shimmer pink whether you're in your teens or 80.
248766,2,I bought it because I love the brand but I expected it to be at least as good as Neutrogena on the spot and I saw no results at all.
129976,0,"good lotion, but smells just like sun block. the whole reason for me to purchase this lotion was to have sun block on mt kids arm during the the day....with out smelling like sun block.. i wish they could change the odor to something more pleasent. i could have just bought regulat sun block, if i had known."
115834,0,"I love Philosophy's products and the fact that it's a 3 in 1 product: shower gel, shampoo and bubble bath.I have used this as a shower gel and shampoo. The shower gel, to me, seems like it takes more to suds up. The shampoo makes my hair nice and soft.However the smell of the raspberry in it doesn't last long. Only in the time you wash and rinse off."
194324,0,"I couldn't wait to try this cream with the wonderful orange scent. I did not buy directly from Avalon, but from an Amazon merchant. There is no expiration (or best used by) date on either the jar or the box. Based on others' comments about the wonderful scent that is so faint in mine, I wonder if the jar I received from a reseller was past its prime. That aside, I have had to stop using the cream on my face. It is so heavy that I believe it is blocking my pores. I still plan to use it on my hands and feet, and am interested in trying either the moisturizing lotion or serum. If you don't do well with heavy creams, you might want to try a different Vitamin C product."
91462,1,"This was the first perfume I ever owned, my mom got it for me when I was much younger, I loved how refined I felt wearing it and it didn't take long for me to empty the bottle. I am much older now and I recently started collecting perfumes as my mother did. I hunted this perfume down for sentimental purposes, but I find myself wearing it more than other more expensive perfumes I own because I still feel refined wearing it. I cant smell any alcohol as with some other perfumes, even some expensive ones. I think its an excellent winter perfume, very earthy and warm. Its an excellent perfume for any age too, I spray my own daughter in the mornings with it."
29967,0,"I like this face creme but I wouldn't count on it to help with the wrinkles. I think the words ""wrinkle treatment"" is a little misleading. Overall it's a good moisturizer for the face, elbows and feet. Would I buy it again? Maybe."
66798,0,"I bought this cream to try and fade some acne scars that had darkened in recent years. As an adult, I have tried many different things to heal these areas with little success. I tried this product for three weeks. The first week went great, I saw the acne scars lighten, and actually had a slight breakout that improved seemingly overnight. It even lightened the mole on my neck (bonus!). Second week, I had to take a break and reduce use to just a few times, my skin dried out and seemed sensitive. I had to rehydrate for a couple of days. By the third week, I definitely saw the lightening effect, especially when applying my makeup, my regular foundation seemed so dark when I put it on. So I stopped using it. I don't have age spots, so that wasn't an issue, but my freckles have faded, and I am pleased that my acne scars have lightened and are less noticeable now. Downfall of this product is that (silly me) when applying, I accidentally lightened my eyebrows as well! Don't let that happen to you, take my advice and avoid your eyebrows!All in all, I do like this product, and I do recommend it. As for me, I will continue using it, although just for spot treatment instead of my whole face, and definitely not everyday. Maybe just a few times per month."
167575,2,"I got this product about two years ago and i've had some trouble with it. while it does to a decent job at straightening it would take at least twenty minutes for me to get my slightly wavy shoulder length hair straight. it pulls at your hair and takes about a minute to heat up. after about a year it started turning off randomly while i was straightening. i also recommend using a TON of product, because if you don't, your hair will be wavy again in an hour. i just purchused the herstyler for $50 on amazon and i recommed that one!"
46826,1,"Feels really great on the skin. The only issue I have with it is that it has methylparaben and propylparaben, preservatives that are estrogen mimicking and might be something that women who have/have had breast cancer might want to avoid. They aren't listed in the ingredients in the Amazon product description but all 35 ingredients (most of them natural extracts)are listed on the product bottle."

210654,0,"I love lipglosses and Jessica Simpson's dessert line and was so excited to try this. This product came in a long generous tube with the 'Dessert Beauty' logo on the front. Very pretty and exquisite. I give 2 stars for that alone.I was dissapointed with the fact that hardly anything came out on the applicator when you tried to pull the applicator out of the tube. I had to use 4-5 swipes, when in most lipglosses I only need 1 or 2 swipes on the lips. This smells and tastes good, however, I just was very dissapointed in the amount of lipgloss aspect. As far as lasting power goes, this wasn't that great. It lasted about 2 hours WITH my glossy chapstick underneath.If you love strong lipglosses, pigmented lipglosses, or just a lot of product type of lipglosses, this isn't for you. But if you want a sheer coverage- it does it's job decently. (However you're better off paying $1.00 on a E.l.f lipgloss than this more expensive failure.)"
51345,1,"My Mother suggested I try using her Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion Exfoliating face cream, and I am certainly glad I did. I will not use any other product for exfoliating. My husband and I both use this product weekly, and we can both see a definite difference in our faces.Thank you to My Mother and Dr. Brandt."
10710,0,I have purchased this mirror several times. All my older relatives love it to shave with etc etc.My BIG complaint is that most of the time it is not delivered intact. Amazon has reshipped them to me at no cost but please Amazon start shipping them in bigger boxes and with more bubble wrap around them! This latest replacement was also broken! The box was shipped USPS and the box was covered with grease as well! Yuck! The grease had seeped into the inside of the box. AND no big surprise the items were damaged. One had a fracture on the inside glass and the acrylic frame was damaged too. The other mirror (glass part) popped out of the acrylic frame. I called amazon and they refunded my money and told me to order them again. This is annoying and I'm not sure I want to risk it.
42035,0,"OK... first off I have never used this product,But I understand the basic premiss. I have used a very similar product by shiseido, that I feel was strongly based on the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.Here's the skinny: (and I am dead serous this works fabulously) I use white rice flour or sweet rice flour for extra sensitive skin. It can be used to cleans and or leave on (like a mask) for 15-20-mins and wiped off w/ a damp cloth.you can recycle and clean any large shaker for cheese or spices to dispense from the bulk amount of rice flour.compair white rice flour at $2.00 a LBs to $36.00 plus S/H for 2.60zA chemist once told me when I was 13-yrs old and in love w/ Noxzema, that the best skin care products, are things you can eat. Because our skin eats what we put on it. How cam it really digest all the chemicals and waxes, etc????Another cool idea: roes water, cucumber juice or aloe vera juice put into travel size spray bottles, make great skin toners. (just remember to always keep them refrigerated and check their freshness, before each use.I hope some ppl think this is useful - : )"
82482,2,This shampoo was harsh on my fine hair when it was uncolored. I tried it again now that it is colored hoping (after buying this large bottle) that it would work better on colored hair. Left my hair looking and feeling like frizzled straw. Fortunately have a good shampoo now that is keeping my color safe and my hair looking glossy and soft.I gave this to my husband to use (truly doesn't care what goes on his head as long as it cleans :>)) and he doesn't like it either. His thick healthy hair looks bushy and unruly when done. Off to the trash it went.
174150,0,"love the color. can't use BE every day on my eyes or they swell up. I do love the color, though."
43825,2,"This product smells good and feels rich and creamy on my face. But it caused dry patches on my face and eyelids and I didn't feel reassured that it removed my makeup. Although I couldn't feel a residual film, I felt like I needed to apply a toner to thoroughly cleanse my face. People with sensitive to ultra sensitive skin, like me, probably wouldn't benefit from this product."
164054,1,I'm already a tall guy.... matched with this... I turned heads and I get comments all the time and ladies flat out say 'you smell reallllllly good'.
239026,2,"Giorgio Armani 'Acqua Di Gio' Men's 6.7-ounce EDT Spraythe perfume arrived broken, that bad is that I paid $ 94.82 for this perfume, this is a hoax. Do not buy more at Amazon."
87194,2,Does exactly what it supposed to do and that is wash your hair. You'll get the same results from a bottle of Head and Shoulders. And at a quarter of the price.
26771,0,I used this for a few months happily but then lost the little rubber bits.If I end up buying another I will probably either superglue the thing in or keep it in a ziplock bag by itself.
1331,2,"I've bought this cologne before and really liked it, but the most recent sample I bought from the Perfume Emporium smelled like some cheap no name brand. I don't no if my sample was an old bottle that was past it's shelf life or it was watered down, it may have been in the right container but it wasn't the same cologne."
7186,1,This is a beautiful barrette. It holds my thick hair without pulling. These are definitely an investment but worth the price. I've lost track of how many cheap barrettes I've broken over the years.
226946,0,"I purchased this callus shaver with vision of all the money I'd save by not getting pedicures at the salon, but I must say I am disappointed. I don't know if I have tougher or thicker calluses than other people, but I have not had the best of results with this product. At the salon, I see strings of dead skin come off of their callus tools, but this product barely creates any, and then, only with more pressure from me than I feel really comfortable about. Another thing: do not leave this item in the shower! The blades are extremely prone to rusting- one or two days left there will render the blade totally unusable!On a positive note, the rasp is useful and the design is pretty good. I purchased a bunch of replacement blades from my local Beauty Brands (though they are also available here on Amazon) and I am hoping that will make a difference in how this product performs."
184590,0,"The color is a bit off from what is shown and not exactly what I was looking for. However, I did like that it's very creamy. While I won't be using this often, again, not the color I was expecting, I will use it now and then."
92219,2,"When this product arrived, I glanced at the ingredients and noticed it contains methylparaben and propylparaben. Both are known carcinogens that can be absorbed through the skin. It's beyond me that these substances have not been banned in consumer products, but they seem to be everywhere, including anitbacterial soaps and many lotions. So, I threw it away and experimented with some alternatives.For a better, cheaper buffing cream, try one of the following homemade recipes.* 1 teaspoon olive oil + 1/2 teaspoon powdered white clay (kaolin)Mix together to make smooth paste. Massage into nails and cuticles, then buff as normal. You can find kaolin at health food stores or online.* 1 tsp. toothpaste + 1/2 tsp. lemon juiceMix together. Massage into nails and cuticles. Wipe off excess, then buff as noraml."

231539,1,"I am always on the lookout for astonishing nail color. I do not have pretty hands. I have a lot of red in my skin and dark, bright polishes seem to emphasize this. I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle, but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result. Who has time for that? Two coats of Delicacy covers well; three is better followed by Essie topcoat. My nails look neat, finished and not bare but they don't scream ""I've been polished"" either. The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance. It's a perfect shade for me."
120766,2,"I am a Cetaphil cleanser fan and also thought this would be perfect.But, alas, it feels sticky on my face when I put it on and in the morning it really feels sticky. Sorry I bought it."
129966,1,I have had the hardest time finding a shampoo & conditioner for color treated hair that didnt either make my hair feel dried out...or too oily & heavy. This product seems to find the perfect in between. My hair feels soft & silky & smells great too. I used with the matching shampoo.
160041,0,"this used to clearly be my favorite lotion, BUT it no longer has the pleasant smell of cocoa w/ a hint of vanilla. some new, hard to identify, ""chemical"" smell now predominates--and it's not a fragrance i like.maybe they started putting in less cocoa butter (cocoa beans are now costlier)and added this off-putting fragrance as some kind of artificial cocoa smell. it's a wrong move; the lotion doesn't smell nice.keep the lotion's formula like it was in the past. if you have to charge more, then so be it; it's not like it's expensive already."
63784,2,"Pros:- This top coat has the weird ability of being able to even out a streaky polish application, if you apply it while the last coat is still tacky. I'm not sure how it does that, but it was useful back when I was still buying cheapo streaky-formula polishes. With sheer colors I can't just hide streakiness by adding another coat of color - but I could smooth it out with a coat of Zoya Armor.Cons:- It dries very slowly. Even with the Zoya quick-dry drops I still managed to get at least one sheet mark.- It's not shiny - it will follow the contour of every tiny bubble and slight imperfection in your polish.For a while, I was using Zoya Armor as a sort of ""pre top coat"" - to even out my polish and make it less streaky, and then I would put my ""real"" top coat on top (Dior) to solve the drying time issue and the shine issue. But then I discovered that some polish brands aren't streaky. And I stopped buying streaky polishes. Chanel polish is my favorite brand now and it never streaks. Dior is my favorite top coat and it dries lightning fast with a smooth shiny surface. Zoya Armor became an unnecessary step."
11587,1,"I especially love the brush. Natural bristles, but soft enough for baby. (Also just sturdy enough deal with newborn scalp flaky blahs.) The yellow color is adorable & has a vintage feel. This set would make a great baby gift!"
57580,0,The picture makes the product seem like it is a lot larger; It seems as though you will get a deodorant sized stick of sunscreen when in fact the product I received was in the shape and size of a dry glue stick. It does what it isintended to do but I expected more of the product and feel mislead by the picture which is not the format or size theysell the sunscreen in.
108123,0,"Have been using cream for about a month, and it's just okay, nothing special. Not very rich feeling on skin; does not moisturize any differently than other low price creams. Will not buy it, again."
216169,2,"It was Ok. it dries my hair maybe a little better than a regular tower, but it's not noticeable. I've really thick curly hair, so it makes my hair frizzy when i take it off. Most of the time i wear my hair straight so no big deal, but it does not dry much better. if you're on a budget, save your money and buy two cheap towels at Walmart instead"
170419,0,"As a turquoise fanatic and nail polish enthusiast, I had to purchase this.Pros:-Only two coats needed-Bright color-Dries insanely fastCons:-Appears to be flat, no shimmer /gloss to it and thus a top coat of clear is needed. Some girls choose to skip this step but you can't really do that with this one.-The turquoise ended up being a teel that leans very green. This wasn't what I was looking for at all.-Thin polish that chips easily, another reason to need a top coat of clear."

174792,1,"I have been using this foundation for years, and recently was doing some research on the products I have been using on skindeep.com. I was astonished to learn that this product was rated a 9 out of 10--10 being the worst. I know there are others out there in the same boat as myself--what do I switch to? When I mentioned to the girl at the cosmetic counter at Nordstrom's what I had learned, she said that several other people had also told her the same thing. Now I see on beautypedia.com that this product is being discontinued, and I believe it is because of the bad press it is getting from websites like skindeep.com making us aware of the harmful ingredients in the product."
194059,0,This nail polish is very thin and goes on extremely sheer. You need at least 4 coats to make it opaque and to get the color you want.
187667,2,I'm not crazy about this brush cleaner. It's too thick and gooey. Doesn't lather very well and takes a lot to completely rinse out from your brushes. Save your money and use baby shampoo instead.
196505,0,"I got my first CHI (Nano - not digital) a little over two years ago. After about 11 months, it pooped out and stopped heating up, so I contacted Farouk and quickly got it replaced before my warranty ran out. I am on my second one and exactly 13 months later, it did the exact same thing. I am looking into a new one to replace it and will not be getting another CHI. I know that there have been issues with fake CHIs, but mine was purchased through a hairdresser so I don't know what to think. CHIs work great and quickly straighten hair, but they are too expensive to replace every year.I am looking into either a Solia or Sedu, which are comparable in price to the CHI if you use the 20% discount on Folica.com. I have only read a couple of reviews that complain about these not lasting multiple years, and both of them come with a 2-year warranty. I'd at least look into these brands before buying a CHI."
199942,0,"It took me a few weeks to get used to this hair dryer. It's heavy and the buttons/adjusters are not in the best place. It's also a little noisy and the ""low"" is not that low.

182610,2,"I'm in my late thirties and was looking for a less expensive skin care regimen for my aging skin. I usually use Dermalogica. I tried Aveeno because I like/use the products they make for babies. Boy, was I disappointed! Although I liked the way the cream made my skin feel and look, the fragrance was completely overwhelming. I tried to get used to the smell, but it continued to give both my husband and me terrible headaches. Yuk! A perfectly good product ruined by a horrible fragrance! Do not buy this product if you are at all sensitive to smell!"
218882,1,"This cologne was difficult to find in brick & mortar locations, easy to get on Amazon!"
129513,2,"This was a horrible product - a complete fake. It looked extremely cheap, and when i plugged it in and turned it on, and it would not even get hot. Amazon charged me for returning it too. I would NOT recommend this purchase - its better to spend the extra money on a real one from a reputable retail store."
130448,0,I haven't yet used the product so not sure about quality but since it's OPI I'm sure it will be fine.But when it arrived the lid was loose and some of the polish had leaked out.be more careful when packaging
140517,0,"Years ago I bought the pre-made product which lasted forever and did a beautiful job for cleaning jewelry. It works really well on diamonds and gets them to sparkle unlike anything else I have found. So when it finally ran out I was happy to find this refill concentrate here on Amazon. It is a great idea as I am all for reducing waste and being environmentally friendly. However I found the product to be less satisfying to use, it just didn't look the same. It doesn't have the consistency as the original product which seemed to cling to the jewelry better. Mixed as directed this just seems like grey-blue water. It will clean, but I think I would prefer the original formulation. This is unfortunate because it is a great idea and more cost effective to mix your own. I would still buy this again if they quit making the original because it is still a good product."
139899,0,"I've had mine for a long time, but use it infrequently. It's a bit of a pain because it runs out of water for the steam really fast, and unless you use distilled water, it's prone to scale. Also, the steam concentrators are seated very shallow and are easy to knock over. I'm surprised I haven't broken them yet. Aside from that, the facial sauna is a nice thing to have for a variety of uses. I'm just keeping an eye out for one that's more stable."
194986,0,"I have tried it for about a month and haven't experience any magic difference. It does what shampoo normally does, but regarding ""volumizing"" function, disappointing, it seems not work on my hair. Maybe I should continue to use it and then see what will happen."
127379,2,"I have used other Alba products and have really enjoyed them but this was nowhere near as good as the others. It doesn't lather and it doesn't smell like lavender... If you want a better lavender scent, try avalon organics."
2840,2,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair. The item does not heat up and it takes at least and hour just to crimp her hair. Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back. This product is a rip-off.
127255,1,"Forever Krystle for women, I absolutely adore it, .This one is in my top 10 of all time, Just wonderful fragrance, However I did find mine at a much better buy at Thefragrancefactory.com"
229155,0,Nice all in one kit for someone like me trying it out of the first time.
123506,2,"At first when I found that Amazon carried Love's Lemon Cologne I was thrilled to say the least. Upon receiving the product after opening the cologne, I discovered that the fragrance was nothing like it used to be which I wore often. I don't know why it changed so very much but I will probably not ever wear it.LaLoie in California"
25554,2,"For 9 bucks a bottle, I was expecting a better product. It has a very mild and pleasant smell and rubs in easily leaving behind a slight greasy feeling. Sun protection was mediocre at best. I applied it once every 2 hours with no water exposure and I still got burned. They claim it is ""sweat proof"" and that it will not get in your eyes and sting... Totally inaccurate. I have never before experienced such a stinging sensation around the eyes from a sunscreen before.Terrible product and I will not be purchasing this again."
76983,2,"really strong scent, i would say this is for men only. would not by for myself but my husband likes it."
203503,2,I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead. I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit. Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps!
14304,1,"You cant find this lipwtick hardly anywhere. I found it , you shipped it immediately and thanks!"
239783,0,"it is a very small size, but the fragance smells really good. it is my husband favorite so he keeps it in the car. love it"
180729,2,"The dryer works well, but the diffuser hardly diffuses the hair at all. The air still comes through almost directly which defeats the purpose of it. I ended up returning it."
175535,1,"will buy again! great price! perfect size! spray pattern is a fine mist, just what I needed!easy to store!"
171534,0,"I think this replaced a product before it, pro-v frizz control but it is not as good. Both products have been discontinued and I knew this when I purchased this item."
159552,0,"Positives:-The moisturizer hydrates very well.-Smells good.Negatives:-Pricey.-The fragrance is a bit overwhelming.-No SPF.-The formula is a tad bit on the greasy side.-Product has also caused me to break out a little bit. Never really had any pimples present until I used this product more frequently. This may be due to my sensitive acne prone skin, but that's just me.Overall: Good product, but you can spend the same amount of money and buy a better moisturizer that's non comedogenic and has an SPF. Also, the texture is a little too thick for my taste. You only get a small amount for the price. The bottle only lasted me for about month. I'd rate this product as average."
156954,2,I bought this for a trip o Europe. I used it twice and it started to act funny it would turn on but the turn itself off after a few minutes. This continued for a couple of uses then refused to turn on at all. I had two weeks without a curling iron which was not fun. I can't return it as it is over 30 days so will just throw it out.
61913,0,"This is an okay shampoo- it's light, it lathers well enough. The scent is light and clean. I'm not sure exactly what the scent is, perhaps soapwort? It's a very light scent, not at all perfumey. The main problem with this shampoo is that it's runny. It takes quite a bit to lather up one's full head (especially if you have long or thick hair). Given that this shampoo is pretty pricey, it becomes pretty hard to justify given how much gets wasted. For a shampoo that's just okay it's not worth the price."
162211,2,"This new product line just popped up on ShopNBC and Amazon. They played up their cult following in Europe on ShopNBC (complete with rep with accent) but I have not been able to find 1 review on the web for this product. Given the pricing, I would not buy until someone, somewhere can tell me whether it is worth it. Their own site sounds more like an AVON pitch (be your own boss, blah, blah, blah) so that makes me leery of the truthfullness of their ""luxury"" tag line (with apologies to AVON but they know their market and don't price out of it). Has anyone actually used these products?"
53674,2,I am disappointed in this brush drier. It does not get hot enough to do the job. A good brush drier is not easy to find. I wish Conaire could do better.
171611,0,"First off, I would like to say that until I tried this color I have loved absolutely every other punky colour shade that I've tried. I've been in love with the reds and purples that I've tried. But Alpine Green came out a weird sort of muted blue green and then after a week or so turned blue. It was a lovely color of blue, yes, but I was hoping for a pine green. Yes, I bleached before hand. I will say that once it turned blue, it stayed nice and bright for a couple months. I've had great experience with punky colour lasting for weeks on end. Definitely the best crazy hair dye I've used, and I've tried them all. I was just disappointed in this particular color..."
61605,0,"It comes in a very tiny pump bottle. It does feel nice and soothing when I apply it on the eye area. But the firming, the tightening and the lightening claimed by the manufacturer are not there. Will not buy it again."
116930,0,"This blush is SO intense I find it hard to apply. I'm very fair and this makes me look sunburned! I have to put light powder over it to tone it down. The good news is it should last forever since so little is needed. I use a big brush and a light touch and it's still too rosy.If you're fair, try a really light color."
82144,2,this lip stain is most likely for cool toned people cause it was not flattering on my warm toned skin the color was not long lasting just a plain fail for me
124087,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
214181,1,Really enjoy the oil and the benefits with massages - not too strong of a smell - lasts a long time.
200332,0,"I have used several colored hair sprays and this one is middle of the pack. It sprays out well and covers well. The color matches good. However, it rubs off easily. Basically you can't touch your head after you've sprayed it on. This is the case just minutes afterwards, or hours. Streaks N Tips rubs off easily too. Graftobian and Adair won't rub off."
120285,0,"Because I am extremely allergic to the chemicals used in most hair dyes, I use a henna-based, color hair dye instead. Rather than wearing a warm towel around my head for 2-hours, I read that wearing a heat cap would help speed up the setting process. I receive the cap in a timely fashion. It functioned properly. However, the cap was a tight fit for me and it did NOT come all the way down the sides or back of my head. I was terribly disappointed. I was expecting the cap to give me the same type of secure, adjustable fit of a bonnet hair dryer. I did not care for the chin strap at all. I would recommend instead that you purchase either a bonnet hair dryer or the ""Belson"" jet bonnet hair attachment (matte gold style). Wear one of those thin plastic hair caps (the kind beauty stores sell in a package of 10 bonnets for 99 cents) and set your hair dryer at a low setting. It worked much better for me."
190125,2,This smells like like old lady....this is very different than the store. I would not buy this again or recommend. Amazon still rocks! Just don't like the product.
51479,0,well overall this was an ok product but it didnt keep my hair straight for a long time. also it recently broke(the top iron stopped heating up)i would say it is worth the money if u have ruly hair
111697,1,"This item is truly amazing. I love it. I have fine straight asian hair. However, within 8 minutes, I can transform my pin straight hair into a headful of wavy curls. I've gotten so many compliments. I am considering buying another iron as a reserve in case mine is lost or becomes broken. I would be absolutely devastated if Vidal Sassoon discontinued producing this product. The curls I have gotten are similar to the type of curls one would get from braiding wet hair and then sleeping on it overnight - except 50 times better !!! Give this product a try ... its amazing !!!!"
185734,0,I just had my toe digits done and was a little disappointed. The Pink look in the bottle is not what landed on my toes. More of a beigy look. Can anyone suggest a another color for me. I tried Vanity too and the same thing.
102397,0,"This T3 flat iron worked great until the temperature dial broke. Then, when I try to return it to T3 Micro, I find out that neither Payless Beauty, nor Amazon.com are authorized resellers of the T3 product. All T3 Micro can do for me is sell me a new one! Payless has not responded to my email inquiry from a week ago, so I guess a bad review is my only recourse. All I can say is ""BUYER BEWARE""."
102789,1,I love The Original Little Sprout! My daughter has the curliest hair ever and the Clean and Light Baby Hair Gel keeps her curls all day. They never get frizzy and she doesn't look like she has any product in her hair. People always ask me how I keep her curls looking so good and I tell them all about The Original Little Sprout. Thank you for making just a great product!
195318,0,"I've purchased this product for a number of years, however, It isn't what it used to be! It makes some areas darker than the others, and it looks blotchy!! It gets orangy on larger parts of the body. Probably won't order it again."
166221,0,"Its a peel off mask, I thought its suppose to peel off at least some gunk in my pore. Zip, Nada, none. And the smell is super strong if you put some on the bridge of your nose. But the good side is it leaves your skin smooth. I guess it does some good."
93121,0,"I tried this moisturizer for a few weeks. However, the product caused my sensitive skin to react, and I was forced to stop using the product and return it.As an alternative for those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Art of Shaving Eye Gel, which I have used for some time with no adverse reaction.This product moisturized well, but irritated sensitive skin."
230282,0,"This product performed as expected. It isn't a product that I'd recommend using unless you have some serious scalp disorders. Viewed as a medication, I would have to say that you could probably not find a stronger or more effective solution over the counter."
66336,0,Article is OKFast delivery made by DHLBut too expensive tax because the expenses of delivery are not mentioned on the document of import and DHL applies taxes to an amount very upper to that paidBest regards
230134,2,"This mousse totally bites! It doesn't deliver - plain and simple. If you're looking for something to do normal things that a mousse does, like give control or curl, then you're barking up the wrong tree."
115539,2,"this pencil is hideous. all you reviewers must have been paid to give a good review - this is NOT a soft pencil - it is hard and the color doesn't go on without a lot of pressure. i could have bought a similar item at the drugstore for about 3 bucks! it's like the colored pencils i used when i was a kid!since i tried to use it, i'm stuck with an almost $15 pencil that is not at all as described."
92915,2,"I am very displeased with hair outcome after using this product. Brunettes starting out w/ medium or light brown, Do NOT use 6A light ash brown unless you are looking for auburn hair. The color does not match color tone on box. I purchased the product in June of 2012~ not sure if this is new formula bc in past had different outcome. This new version left my hair with strong orange/red brassy undertones, esp on roots in direct light. My hair was just cut and very healthy. I plan to go to salon asap to ask for color correction treatment or toner bc I hate it. I would not buy this product again ever!"
58158,1,If you wanted to try bliss here is a great starter kit to see what the talk is all about. All of them come in convenient carry-on friendly sizes too!
199380,0,"I bought this perfum a long time but i couldn't fined it anywhere else so im glad that i founded here. The perfume arrived on time and in excelent condition, but it seems like the company changed smell and now it is too strong. It smells good but now it is too strong for me."
205583,2,"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes. I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing. yes the scent is great, I love it. But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me. Really really disapointed. I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines. They are quality and can last most of the day. This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days."
84465,0,"This shampoo does seem to add some volume to my hair, unfortunately, it's been really frustrating to use. It leaves my hair extremely tangled. Even when I put copious amounts of conditioner after this shampoo, I still have a really hard time brushing my hair. I've never really had this problem with any other organic or conventional hair product."
41060,1,"I'm a facial product junkie (hello, Sephora addict!) I'm always trying new skin care products and looking for something that will make my combination skin clean, balanced, and fresh. This stuff is by far the best toner I have ever tried. The Clinique stuff always dried out my skin too much (because of the alcohol). And then some toners that are alcohol-free don't actually do anything to clean your skin, so they are worthless. It's hard to find a good one, but this is it!I use this product after using my cleanser because I want to make sure I get any residue or debris of make-up off. This gets my skin smooth and clean without drying it out. Plus, I find the subtle rose scent to be quite pleasant.I will absolutely buy this again."
13282,1,This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do. It hangs on the wall and is convenient. It doesn't have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some. But that is really all I need. It has no attachments but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.
100715,0,"Smells like carnations to me (love that scent!) but dries down to a sweet, candy smell, but not rich enough like I would prefer. It's nice - but I won't continue to wear it."
229051,1,"I briefly dated a man who wore this as his signature scent. After one whiff, I've never been able to forget how amazing it smells -- I still pass men wearing this and want to jump their bones. The hype is right, men. Women love this scent. This is a scent that will get you laid.It's so good, in fact, that I've bought a bottle for my boyfriend and insisted he wear it. It really does seem to be a universally flattering scent, and at about $60 for 4.2oz, it's a better deal than most of the perfumes I buy for myself."
17094,0,"I used this product for 15 years, but this will be the last bottle I buy. The ingredients used to list Tea Tree Oil...no more!...and the fragrance is now fruity.There are other spray-in conditioners, and now Aussie has lost its advantage for me."
232302,0,Find roller holders don't work too well --- I would prefer something that wasn't all a hard plastic to stay in your hair easier
237061,0,"Yes bigen has long lasting results and is resistant to fading, but it comes at a cost. It is a metallic hair dye. That means even bleach won't lighten it. Your stuck with the color til it grows out. Second, it isn't natural as people seem to believe. It has peroxide. If you read th box it says no mixing required, well that's because the peroxide is in the mix, so that's not much different then your boxed dye. And yes, there have been severe allergic reactions associated with this dye. I'm not against this product, I just think you should be aware of what your getting yourself into if you choose to use it.Make sure you want to be dark, for a long while if you have long hair.Do an allergy test.And read the fine print, its not really that natural, but it its better then most.I've seen great results and happy people who use it.I've seen very upset girls after they tried putting dye, bleach, color remover etc, and realized that the're stuck, either grow it out or cut it off.And twice I've seen really gross blisters on the scalp and face, both were long time users who ignored the warning signs. Itching scalp, dry patchy scalp after use, but since they used it for years, maybe decades, they kept using it , til they had a VERY BAD reaction.Just be informed (:"
205840,2,I have the real one and it's amazing. This one is not the same! It's fake or reformulated. It's more synthentic and missing warm and sexy scent. Very upset with my purchase.
169887,0,"This is a really light oil, but I don't use this on my skin. The Grapeseed oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils."
4373,0,"The eye mask part is large and comfortable, so if that's all you're looking for, this is a great deal. However, I was interested in the hot and cold gel pack... It is too small to effectively cool or heat through the eye mask."
192450,2,"I thought this would smell like a sweet olive flower, but instead it smells like licorice. Great smell if you love the candy."
101205,1,Color is true to what is on the outside color swatch. Pencil a little drier than I would prefer but works nicely.
74339,2,"This product does not have a little tin foil sealant under the cap. As a result, this shampoo can spill out. I had this shipped with a larger item and it spilled out all over the box. I lost a good portion of it. It's good shampoo, but I will not buy it through Amazon again unless they put a bit of tin foil under the cap to prevent spilling."
106179,1,I have broke out in a rash in the spring and summer time since I was 2 years old and I'm 43 so I have tried all kind of things. I have dry skin and the sweat makes me itchy and I break out in a rash. I ususually break out in May and its the middle of June and I still haven't broke out at all!! It makes my skin soft. You cant beat $2 or less for this soap!! Diff a miracle soap to me!!
46690,1,"I bought this product about six months ago from doing some online research. I had cut my hair really short (Think Halle Berry in Die Another Day), and I suddenly wanted my hair back. I had begun to take this vitamin, and while my hair didn't grow at the rate that most people claim, it did grow faster. I also wear one of those hair bonnets that have the grow stuff in them at night, and that helped A LOT! I don't break up the doses (just because I will forget and don't feel like it), so I take all six tablets at bedtime. But another benefit that I got from this vitamin is that I no longer have acne. This vitamin made my skin literally bump-free! My family has even asked me about my skin, and I told them about my hair vitamins! Now, I'm just working on the spots that are there from past acne, but my face is completely acne free. The longer I take them, the better it gets. I tried the hair vitamins in the purple jar (also on amazon) and they are still sitting on my dresser collecting dust. I'm a HF37 girl for life!"
168176,1,"I had a salon in SF use this for me years ago, and when I changed jobs had to find it on my own. Very hard! Then found it through this vendor - they're great. The color is gorgeous, a warm, soft, glossy coral, and I have received so many compliments, I can't even count. I do have red hair and fair skin with some freckles, but other friends with vastly different coloring also love it. It goes with every outfit."
62015,1,"I do love the Smashbox Photo Finish Correcting Primer. I am 65 with dry skin, it doesn't dry out my skin and gives you a great pallet to put on your foundation or other makeup. Problem is it is now a bit too expensive for my tastes so moved on to Maybelling Age Defying primer. Works just about as well."
216893,2,"First, buying perfume through internet is risky. Even though there were many sellers offering in Amazon, I ordered the one sold by Amazon LLC. I quickly received the package. when i opened the box, I found the wrap around the perfume box is open at the bottom. Anybody who received in this condition should immediatley return it. I still give it a chance thinking Amazon would not cheat. When I use the perfume, I have the smell only when I put it on. Then gone. I would still buy things from Amazon but would not buy perfume through internet anymore."
121496,0,"The 1.7 size is decent-more than plenty, especially if your not sure about the product. I personally think two sprays is perfect, anything more could come off as too strong. When I first received the product I sprayed on my wrists and one over my uniform, I could definitely smell it. It's sweet but on the verge of being strong, I like it. I rated a 3, but 3 1/2 would be perfect. I'm deployed and I wanted something light, this will do for now, I probably will not repurchase though. My favorite perfume is Nina Ricci's, this doesn't compare, but it was terrific for the price, size and nice to try something new."
57114,2,"Not for the product itself, i'm quite waitng for this product to use during my pregnant time, however when i got it, the prodect has expired the time, hardly to imagine why this could happen, so disappointed"
208586,2,The dryer stand is a great idea but as soon as you clip the dryer on the stand it falls over and you can't keep it standing to blow dry your hair.
24751,2,"I buy my husband the Joop for men and I love the smell of it. I took a chance on this hoping it would smell as well as the men's colonge. I can't imagine any woman who would wear this fowl smelling perfume. I wasted $23. Right after I opened the package and took a whiff, it went right into the garbage can. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Keep your money. I learned my lesson, never buy perfume online unless you know how it smells."
160063,1,"I have only been using this product for two weeks and it really does seem to be working! For years I have struggled with breakage and have been at my wits end with my short hair, relying on extensions to keep the length I like. Though I have never tried a product like this, I was very skeptical, but knew I had to try it after reading all the reviews. I am proud to say that I've already seen a change! My hair is much softer, shiner and even a little thicker. Before I started, I was due for a relaxer, but now I will be able to hold out for quite a while. I have also noticed a little difference in length and can't wait for more results!"

92739,1,"I have been searching for a lip product that would go on and feel like a gloss, but look like a lipstick for, what seems like, forever. I almost can't believe that I found it! I get so many compliments on my lips now. I am horrible at putting on lipstick, and gloss was never enough color for me. So, this product is perfect for people like me. Yay!"
80431,1,"The Spin Spa is really a great product but the ""pumice"" started falling apart the first time I got it wet. All in all the Spin Spa is working great for me and it does make feel like I've gone to a spa everytime I use it."
54445,2,They took the payment and never delivered! I am a usual customer of Amazon but I have never seen such horrid customer service. All my other shopping items were delivered on time but no trace of the dryer stand. Tried to contact the company but no one responded.
187965,0,"The good part is that there are many heat settings and this curling iron heats up well, and turns off automatically if you forget it and leave it on. It also has a protective sleeve to put on the curling iron to cool down. It curls very well if you can hold the hair on the iron. The negative part for me is that either the spring is too weak (that's my guess) or the ceramic barrel is so slippery that it does not hold my hair firmly when curling. The hair slips out unless I apply pressure on the underside of the handle.Several years ago I bought a Conair that looked almost like this with the golden barrel. I loved it! It finally bit the dust. It was not easy to find another 3/4"" Conair with the golden ceramic barrel in the stores, so I ordered through Amazon. Immediately I found my hair kept slipping off the barrel, unlike my former one, and I contacted Conair asking if they could provide a stronger spring. They said to send it back and they would replace it. They did, promptly! However, the second one seems to have the same weakness, so I'm assuming I'll have to live with it, and may end up using the Revlon I also bought, even though it is not as nice a product, nor does it curl the hair as well."
210706,0,"I only gave Mambo 3 stars because it's not for everyone. If you're all about meetin' girls and meetin' guys and havin' FUN then it's perfect, if not then it's not for you. Luckily that's what I'm all about."
22158,0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
65572,2,"So, this lipstick lasts for many hours as advertised. However, I don't like it.The color does not blend well with the lips and it looks dry after a short time(it comes with a gloss, not a moisturizer).I'd not buy it again."
191614,1,"I live in Alaska, and the dry season here lasts a good 6 months. Anthony for Men face lotion helps with the dry patches on my forehead, eyes and nose. A good product. It would be better if it was less expensive, and if I knew there was no animal testing."
146336,0,"I purchased this product in May of 2006, and it works exactly the same as when I first used it. I have extremely thick black hair, and I have to admit, this product does an amazing job. HOWEVER, the horrible burnt smell that comes from this flat iron is worse than any other iron I've used before. And the smell stays with you! At first I thought I was hallucinating, but then one day I did my friends hair using the iron and when she walked past me later that day-I smelled burnt hair! So, the moral of the story is if you have thin-medium type hair and know that you won't be using this iron on the highest setting, then this product is definitely for you. IF YOU DON'T, and instead find that the strands of your hair are as thick as dreadlocks, be prepared to smell like burnt hair the first few days after using this product."
156266,2,"I bought this item from a local beauty supply store. I had several problems w/ the flat iron. First, my hair is fairly long, and when I would slide the hair along the plate, hairs would get caught between the plate and the plastic that held the plate, breaking the hairs. It didn't matter how big or small the section of hair was, some would get caught.Second, the iron completely stopped working after about six months. It was if the ""on"" switch stopped working. Setting the appliance to ""on"" didn't cause the power light to come on, and the appliance didn't heat up. I sent the appliance back to Helen of Troy, only for them to tell me they didn't have a replacement model in stock, and they couldn't tell me when they *would* have on in stock. They didn't tell me this until 4 weeks after I sent them the item for replacement.Long story short, save your money, buy a different appliance!"
8105,1,"Spritz.com really needs to check their product description - they're describing &quot;Paris&quot; not &quot;Pasha&quot;!According to Webster, pasha is a man of high rank. &quot;Pasha&quot; is also an elegant, sophisticated scent from Cartier.Unique in its combination of amber, cedarwood and sandalwood, it is also original because of the inclusion of a rare pure essense: Golden Alyssum from the Comores Islands.The handsome bottle holding &quot;Pasha&quot; was inspired by the masculine design of Cartier's Pasha pen. Oblong in shape the bottle displays the Cartier signature"
15873,0,"The smell was wired, more like alcohol, not very pleasant anyway. And after using it, my skin became very dry and I don't know why."
42565,2,"I would say this is a safe smell, enjoyable, clean and not overwhelming. I found it generic, many other fragances smell alike. In my opinion projection is low, as well as duration. I get 4-5 hours on my skin. Good for work I would say, unoffensive.The bottle is poorly made, the sprayer started failing and the liquid started to leak. I had to change the bottle in less than a week. Since the bottle has this strange design it's not possible to know where the failure is."
69419,1,Excellant product for the money. Have used it for over 25 years. Can't find a product as good as this
171613,0,"When I first bought this last year, it came out beautifuly! It was a gorgous teal color and I absoloutly loved it! When I bought it this year though, wanting to go back to that color, it turned out dark green...I was not happy. I dont know why the same dye would turn out two different colors, but it did."
161554,2,I bought two of these hair dryers and within months both of them broke. One would only work on high and the other would only work on low. Obviously I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.
59330,1,"I really enjoy this soap, and I actually mix this with the peppermint version (love the sensation) in a single bottle. Usually fill it with 1/4th of the tea tree and the rest with the peppermint. However, this is a warning to everyone: DO NOT USE THIS OR ANY OTHER TEA TREE OIL PRODUCT AS TOOTH PASTE. Tee tree oil is a great antiseptic and cleanser but can be VERY hazardous to your health if, for any reason, it is taken into your mouth. I throw this warning out there because other Dr. Bronner's all-in-one soaps are advertised as being adequate toothpaste, but there is considerable research that shows Tee Tree Oil, while being organic and natural, is indeed hurtful towards your body if absorbed orally. It is completely safe outside the body, though, for skin cleaning and such. Just be cautious."
107186,0,The Pro K Vitamin K Cream is very slowly working. It has been 15 days of using it everyday. I will know better after 30 days.
226516,1,Received package about 3 days after I ordered it and it was just what I expected. The perfume on the other hand not so great. The smell is too sweet for my taste. Not for everybody
2392,0,"Positives:Sticks well to the shower enclosure. It actually has three different ways to hang the mirror - stick it with suction cups, hang it on a nail, place it somewhere.If you wet the mirror, it works. No fogging etc.The magnification option works well. It's easy to magnify while shaving and at the highest magnification I can literally see every hair on my face. :)Negatives:You need to wet the mirror before you can use it or it fogs up. You also need to periodically wet it after a few minutes or it gets little drops all over and nothing is visible. Not exactly fogging, but large drops.However, for this price its a good mirror. If you don't mind splashing it a bit every 5 minutes or so, which I don't."
192064,1,The concealer does what it's supposed to do. I've been using it for a couple of years on my face and legs. I use it sparingly so a small tube lasts a long time. The consistency is just right even to the end of the tube.
118934,2,Went through all of this for friggin 60 days.....absolutely nothing !!! most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...
118599,1,"I love this face and body wash! Even though it's called rose geranium, it doesn't smell too flowery. IT smells almost like green tea. So refreshing I sniff and sniff as I wash my face until bubbles get in my nose!It also cleans really gently!"
26575,2,"Yes it's made in the U.S. and is durable. Yet the valve is so big it is impossible to inflate and keep pressurized when you try to put the cap in. Filling with water kinda worked, until anyone (no matter how small) went to sit on it.... again poor valve design."
53748,0,"This product for the price does the job. No bells or whistles, just a small mirror with a very low power light. That's it."
156186,1,"DELON Coconut Body Butter was an amazing find for me! The scent is long lasting and a ""little goes a long way"" I especially like the round packaging that the butter was in. Product arrived on time and in good shape. I will be ordering more.JADE"
42205,1,"Glad to find this perfume still available and at such a reasonable price. It is what my mother always wore, and it's a nice memory of her. I seem to have inherited enough of her body chemistry that it smells very similar on me."
47014,0,"Like the above reviewer, I love this scent but it never stays on me. I put alot on my body and the smell disappears within minutes. Too bad because its a great scent."
75867,0,Smells nice from the bottle but not so nice on me. And the fragrance does not last. I am actually using it as an air freshener in my bedroom.
115644,2,Putting something with this much chemical outgassing next to your eye can be a major problem. The eyepatches I always picked up at the drugstore all looked like these but there was no chemical smell and nothing attacking my eye.
244411,0,"I have done many chemical peels. This cream is just AHA 10%. That is VERY weak. I've done 80% ( chemical peel ) and that's still a weak chem peel too. The best what this product can do is improve your skin tone. If you want to see real results, you have to do a TCA peel. But, your skin will literally come off in layers. So I guess it's not for everybody. You shouldn't give this product a low rating because it ""didn't remove your fine lines"". You obviously don't know much about chem peels then! The stronger peels don't come in creams. You will have to apply the acid directly onto your face. Probably a good product for people in their 20's but other than that, it's not gonna make much of a difference. My expectation was that it would improve the skin tone. Not much has changed."
135832,1,I dab this on scabs and the skin turnover increases. Also very emolient so I dab on dry patches on face.
200124,0,"Did a great job blow drying my hair, but the dryer is too heavy for me so I am exchanging it for something lighter. Also, the cool button is located right where your index finger goes, so you end up accidentally pressing it quite a bit."
4103,0,"L'Occitane - Th&eacute; Vert au Jasmine Eau de Toilette is a light, sweet fragrance. There are no top, middle and bottom notes that change the fragrance as it dries down. So there are no surprises here; it simply becomes less intense over time. This is a good choice when you want a light, non-offensive fragrance because it's a hot day, or you don't want to take any chances on overpowering a room.There are similarities between L'Occitane's Th&eacute; Vert andGreen Tea By Elizabeth Arden For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces. Both fragrances have a ""green tea"" note that is more like fresh grass with a touch of mint than it is like brewed or loose green tea.L'Occitane's Th&eacute; Vert au Jasmine has a very sweet floral note, whereas Arden does not. For me, the floral used here seems quite generic. You'll have to close your eyes and use your imagination if you want to identify it as jasmine.This is supposed to include some citrus, but I missed that. The only other recognizable note is a hint of cedar. Sometimes I catch that note and it reminds me of pencils - but in a good way.L'Occitane's Th&eacute; Vert au Jasmine at $44.00 is certainly NOT three times better than Elizabeth Arden's version at $15.00. Arden's Eau de Parfum has a higher concentration of fragrance oils and is longer lasting.If you can afford L'Occitane's prices then skip L'Occitane and go directly for Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca by Guerlain for Women 2.5 oz Eau de Toilette Spray, a more sophisticated take on the same idea.I don't dislike L'Occitane's Th&eacute; Vert au Jasmine. It's just significantly overpriced for an eau de toilette that's nothing special. It gets 2.5 stars from me."
17101,1,"My hair is long and naturally curly. This is the best leave in that I have ever used for my hair. It leaves my hair with a nice ringlet curl and very soft and manageable. I have used most every product out there for curly, dry and brittle hair and I have used other products which say they help people who have naturally curly hair to regain moisture and curl but nothing compares to this one. I used to clear the shelves off when I could find it in grocery stores but have not seen this product for several years. I am elated to have found it again at Amazon. I can't wait to receive it. My hair is down to my waist and it's been almost impossible to manage without this product - I have been contemplating a short hair cut cuz I could not find anything that works for my hair like this product does. If you have natural curl to your hair you have to at least give this a try. For curly hair it is a must... And the smell? Is UN-speak able, nothing compares to the smell of this product, it smells so good nothing can compare to it. THANK YOU AMAZON"

34859,0,"I'm always on the lookout to eliminate liquids in my carry-on luggage when I travel. With this shampoo bar, there is no need to carry liquid shampoo. I liked this product at first. I found it best to use a liquid conditioner after rinsing the shampoo. My hair felt clean, and the bar lasts and lasts. However, after using this shampoo daily at home for about 2 months, I developed intense itching in my scalp. As soon as I discontinued using the Liggett's shampoo bar, my scalp returned to normal. I believe I can probably still pack Liggett's in my travel kit and use it for a few days while traveling."
107338,2,"I got the smaller, 'trial' size of this soap when I was on a trip and ran out of my regular soap.The orange dye comes off on white or light colored bathroom surfaces, as I found out, and the formula itself is pretty drying. The scent is light and pleasant but not worth it. Don't buy this."
104390,0,"I received this to try through Bzz Agent. I liked a lot of things about it, but did not love it. It is ""fragrance-free"", but still has a faint smell that is kind of pleasant. I think it must be the cotton. The cleanser is a little thick and hard to get off my skin, but my skin feels great after I am done washing my face. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and moisturized. I'm just not sure how much of my makeup it actually removes. I use white washcloths and feel like there is quite a bit on the cloth after I have washed my face. I don't want to spend that much time getting cleanser off my face if it doesn't remove my makeup."
167066,0,"This product was just ok for me, I wouldn't purchase it again and not that it is bad but I would rather try something else..."
38062,1,"The second best moisturizer product with spf I've ever tried, and I've tried many. This is almost as good as the Jason red elements moisturizing cream. The one and only problem I have with this lotion is that is leaves a tiny bit of a shine on my face that I sometimes wipe of with a tissue after a few minutes. I find this happening with a lot of spf moisturizes, and it is less of a problem with this product compared to many others. With the Jason red elements moisturizing cream, I didn't have that problem at all.I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to fragrences. No problems at all with the red elements products. A bottle lasts about 6 months (for me), but it has a shorter than average shelf life, so don't stock up on it.""Leaping bunny""-approved (cruelty free, no testing on animals)."

210201,0,"my order was sent very promptly, however, the top was broken off the bottle and the bottle was chipped along the bottom. i'm sure that these incidents happened during the delivery, but the bottle could have been packaged better."
65845,2,I usually buy this in the store and figured I would try it online. It is definitely fake and not the real scent. Never again will I buy this.
246367,2,i bought this perfume based on these amazing reviews thinking it would smell amazing. I HATE the way it smells.
111413,0,"I tried the Billy Jealousy shave product with my Panasonic Wet/Dry razor and it was ok. I found a product from Real Shaving Company that works great. And it costs less than half of the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane product. Amazon carries a limited product line of Real Shaving Company products, but they are currently unavailable. I can find them at my local Rite-Aid Pharmacy. They do not however have them on the Rite Aid website. The only online stores are in the UK. Hopefully, Amazon will carry this item."
175501,2,"These are incorrectly labeled as SALUX brand Japanese towels!As you can see I am not the only reviewer to complain about this and I can't believe Amazon hasn't done something to reprimand the supplier. I had read great reviews about the Salux towel on another beauty site and didn't think to read the Amazon reviews since I've had such success with them in the past.Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called ""Leyijie"" which was *totally* inferior to the real Salux towel. I know this because I have since purchased from them directly (same price) and was MUCH happier with the real thing. A quick internet search will lead you to the Salux website - buy them there!"
173609,0,It smells great just comes in a severly small bottle for the price of $14 and some change. Not worth the price for that size bottle but great scent.
85543,1,"This is not only good for naturals... It is good for relaxed hair. I have not had a relaxer in five months, but it works well for the straight hair. It leaves my hair soft and nourished. And it smells good. Not like shea butter... more like a fruity smell. I would recommend this to anyone with African/African American hair."
239694,0,I love the color of this product it was perfect. The actual product is more pinkish than the picture but the color was still amazing. The only downside was that mine broke after 3 days. I would have purchased another one but I found another color at Ulta for $2 that was very similar.
129587,0,"I tried the Cashmere Luxury scent of Caress body wash on a whim. I found the scent to be quite grandmotherly. It is definately old-fashioned and I much prefer the other scents. Still, I love Caress body wash. It is moisturizing and yields impressive, silky lather."
152077,0,"Ok but didn't find out the fuss for these products. They are kinda messy, I brought all of the different kinds in oil and powder. I don't see what all the fuss is about these products. Maybe I didn't stick with them long enough because of the smell, mess and time consumption with these products. Will try to use them up as time permits to free under sink area."
156008,2,"BEAWARE! I have been dying my hair for decades and never had a problem. I decided to switch to bigen because the thought of ""chemical free"" appealed to me. I had relied on amazon reviews so I decided to go with it. (PLEASE google "" Bigen reviews"" the very first one have pages of allergic reactions.) 1 day after- my face and neck started hiving, then I lost my peripheral vision, my eye started to swollen and my eye was starting to shut tight as my scalp burned and itch. For the first time, I went to ER. Im now on Prednisone, pepcid and benadryl with an eye patch."
103225,2,"Recently, I purchased this Conair deep waver and to be direct, it is a piece of junk. If I could, I would have given this product a 0 rating because it's not worthy of 1 point. However, the ""deep waves"" are barely noticeable, it takes awhile to heat up and it doesn't get that hot. Without enough heat, it's nearly impossible to crimp, straighten or wave your hair. I've decided not to bother with it altogether and just throw it away. It didn't cost that much, but I guess you get what you pay for."
250899,2,"I wanted to try 4711 as I've read it's a lovely fragrance. To my nose, the fragrance is remarkably similar to Jean Nate, though much more expensive. This body wash is Okay, as body washes go. However, what scent might be in the wash disappears rather quickly. Actually this is a good thing, as I find this particular scent to be rather strident. I far prefer body washes which are far less costly and which don't have any fragrance...just a nice clean smell.The 4711 bar soap is actually rather pleasant, and has a fine lather, not enormous bubbles as do some soaps."
120054,0,"I have used these for a few yrs and found them easy, portable, dependable, generally effective and pleasant. Now they have a 'new scent' which is not any better than the original scent, AND the degree of darkness is lighter than I was used to. Another ""If it's not broke please don't fix it"" moment. I will try to find original packages in my local stores, not an easy task as it's not widely carried."
242537,2,Item arrived very later than I was told it would and was so old it was unusable! BEWARE. I will not recommend or purchase from this vender!!
152710,2,"I buy it but on the advertisement there is no indication that it was a tester,I should tell the customer if it is a tester, It make me made a mistake and I have to spend extra money to buy another one that was not a tester."
228056,0,shipping came quite fast. i was so excited to get the product but when i tried it.......I didn't get the same sense I felt when I used the Feria shimmering conditioner that comes in the Feria color treatment product. It's definitely not the same product. A little disappointed with the quality.
9362,1,"This straightner, is amazing, It has never once pulled my hair, It straigtens perfectly and I know this because I have extremely curly hair and you don't wanna ever see my frizz. haha. but really if your hair starts to get wavy you should try to use a product. because all that flat iron is made to do is make it flat. Not to keep it that way. You sound ridiculous. Thats like hearing someone with pin straight hair complaining I spent an hour curling my hair but they didnt stay.The only problem I had was the size i bought. BUT THAT WAS MY FAULT. I got the biggest size and it is hard to get up close to the top of my head."
6036,0,"After sampling this fragrance in department stores (too many times), I finally decided to pay for it. I believe this eau de toilette/ cologne is the original made by HUGO BOSS. There seems to be so many different shades/ names being marketed by BOSS that I'm no longer sure which came out when.This fragrance is ""spicy"", ""woodsy"", light, and lasts about 2-3 hrs. I've used FAHRENHEIT for years, and although THIS HUGO is cheaper and more readily available, it really does not compare to Christian Dior's product (which has had only one incarnation). To my nose, this HUGO is passable, but its major drawback is its short ""halflife"". I think I'll go back to FAHRENHEIT after this 5 oz. bottle runs out (which I expect will be soon based on its ""short-lived"" fragrance)."

115663,0,"""Meh"" This oil seems pretty good for hair (though I only did 1 treatment). For skin though, it seems to not absorb well, merely 'coating' dry skin. I think for the future, I'll stick to cocoa and shea butter...."
136077,0,"This is a good suncreen and I have never gotten burned while using it, even where I live in Hawaii. I like to put it on my face when I go to the beach b/c it is not oily and it dries quickly. I would not put it on kids because it smells like rubbing alcohol and I could see them being fussy about it."
2839,2,"Could have bought this item at my local dollar store! Super cheap attachments that do not work well! The spiral curler doesnt spiral (and I have easy-curl hair that measures down to my butt) the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed, not very high quality and would only be good for a young girl who maybe just starting out...a training iron if-u-will hahaha... not for women who know better!"
149772,0,"it always breaks the skin as soon as its applied, plus it gives me alot of tiny bumps all over my face. I love the other peels that skin laboratory has.

101150,0,"Nice color but the nicole products do not seem as high quality as the regular opi and are not staying on as good, once you get past that tho it is still better than most polishes and a pretty color."
34103,0,the smell is ok. takes some time to get use to. definitely for older women. the perfume is more of a winter smell not for summer or spring
244001,0,"I am not very happy with how this shampoo (and conditioner for that matter) leaves my hair. Instead of glossy, soft, flowing hair like normal, it becomes stiff and straw-like. I've found that using it every three washes (about every week) helps keep my red a bit more vibrant than it normally is but doesn't have me constantly have unmanageable hair. I wish it didn't have this horrible side effect because it really does do what it claims in terms of the color and would use this for the rest of my life if it was like every other shampoo/conditioner."
43182,0,"This is a good idea -- however, I found that the white substance doesn't stay under my nails very long. I'd recommend applying it for an evening or special event only. It does look very nice for a short period of time. I don't think it would stay very long in a wet environment."
121126,1,I love it! This is a cleaning smelling scent that lingers all day long. I receive many compliments when I have it on.
198632,2,"This is the 5th CHI turbo we have purchased in the last 4 years. According to my daughter (who is the user of the CHI) it works great, doesn't damage her hair, and heats up immediately. She uses it every day and seems happy with it. As I said, my daughter loves it, but then she isn't the one paying for it.I have several problems with this product. As I mentioned earlier, this is the FIFTH CHI I've purchased. They seems to last about a year (11 months on average for me), and if you bought the thing on-line, well you can forget about any warranty support. I called the dealer who sold me the CHI and they told me I had to contact the manufacturer for warranty work. I've called Farouk (the manufacturer) and they have repeatedly refused to honor the warranty for an on-line purchase. Finally, after threatening them with complaints to the State Attorney General's Office and the Better Business Bureau, and a phone call from my lawyer they sent me a replacement....and a letter stating that there was NO warranty for this replacement.So now 11 months later, the thing is broken again and the manufacturer (true to their word) is not going to honor any warranty.I'll NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE!If you like products that cost 4 times what other similar products cost, that break after less than a year of use, that have non-existent warranties, and are supported by Customer Service personnel who are rude and condescending then I think you're going to love this product!"
11307,2,"A cute little device, it just doesn't have enough suction to get anything out of my skin."
153092,0,"This works very well for moisturizing very dry skin. It's not at all greasy.The scent is very pleasant, but unfortunately, it's quite strong and persistent. It actually smells so nice that it almost makes me crave sweets. I applied it an hour or so before bedtime and for the week I used it, the scent completely permeated my room and a lot of my clothing.I recommend the pure shea butter by De-luxe which has a far milder scent."
92471,2,"It certainly smells like roses but its overpowering and far too strong. Higher quality perfumes tend to be more subtle and this was more like a room spray with spicy undertones. I read some of the other negative reviews and they claim this EDT smells different than the perfume, so perhaps this is why there are so many positive reviews. It doesn't smell as bad as other cheap perfumes because the smell of alcohol is faint, but its not a pleasant smell and the lack of the alcohol scent was its only strong point, even the bottle looks cheap. I ended up giving mine away to a thrift store. I have found other perfumes under $20 that smell like higher quality perfumes but this wasn't one of them. Don't make the same mistake as me and buy it based on reviews. Smell this before you buy it to make sure you like it."
55120,1,"This stuff is amazing. Lactic acid, for those who might not know, is a wonderful AHA that acts as a natural exfoliant and moisturizer. Amlactin has 12% in their lotion.I just -love- this stuff! I apply it on every night, to my chest, my arms, shoulders, and back. I will also occasionally apply it to my whole body. It has cleared up my Keratosis Pilaris (KP- 'chicken skin') on my arms and legs, lightened up some of my mild sun-freckles, and has left my skin silky smooth. I started to notice my KP disappearing within a matter of a couple of days, and my light freckles on my chest have started to fade after about a week and a half. If you have any of these issues, check this stuff out.I absolutely recommend it. Be sure to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen and stay out of the sun when using this lotion, because lactic acid can make the skin more sensitive to the sun.5 stars."
66042,0,"Okay well first off don't buy this on Amazon... I bought mine from Linens & Things and had a 20% off coupon, so the total was $64. (Their list price was $80)This flat iron is nothing special. It does nothing for the static, and it doesn't straighten perfectly either. I've used the CHI and wow that thing straightens my baby hairs! The Maxiglide just makes things partially straight, and my hair is straight for the most part! It does little for my wavy bangs. I wouldn't really recommend this iron, especially for the price. It does work and it does straighten your hair, but keep in mind that there are better irons out there."
195717,0,"I ordered the shampoo and conditioner as a way to grow my hair one inch before prom- I'm 16 years old and my hair is around shoulder length and I highlight it every 6 months. I don't see that much of a difference in my hair after using this for almost a month-but it definitely has grown some. I'm not planning to purchase this a second time because I feel like my scalp has gotten dryer and hair a little frizzier. So I guess this product did what it was supposed to, but not by much."
66221,1,I know it costs a little more then the grocery store stuff but this whole line is amazing and worth every penny. You won't be disappointed. It doesn't over-dry at all. I use the whole product line and I can't remember the last time my face broke out. Give it a shot.
78954,2,This product did nothing for me. Tried it for a few months and it never worked.

75477,2,I use D&G Light Blue and love it! But this stuff was not very appealing at all. Thankfully I only bought a sample!
98011,0,"if you really value your eyesight and cannot stand hassle while at the tanning salon, do not bother buying these. the ones i received are a pretty lavender color and the eyecups detach from the frames so you can wear them alone, but i wouldnt advise that. they come with an elastic string that you have to tie on yourself that holds them on to your face tightly while you tan. the problem is, the string keeps flying off and will not stay on! so i thought no big deal, i'll wear them without out it. but without the elastic band around your head to hold the goggles snugly in place (instead of just sitting on top of your eyes), UV light leaks in from the sides leading to overexposure. i had this happen and kept getting pink eye because of it according to my opthalmologist. gave them 3 stars because they do keep you from getting raccoon eyes and they are comfortable to wear."
46782,1,This lotion is the first I've found that keeps my skin moist all day. It is also safe to apply to my legs right after shaving; something I usually cannot do because of my sensitive skin. I love it!
118064,1,"Most amazing product for your nails you will ever use! Since I was younger my nails have been soft, bendable, they broke in layers, and I had a habit of biting them. I have also used many other products to make my nails hard and pretty like all my friends had. I tried opi, sally hansen, essi, herbal growth, vitamins for nails, etc. This is seriously the only thing that has worked on them EVER. After 2 weeks of using this product my nails looked like girl nails! It was amazing! People have actually noticed and have told me how nice they look. However, you must use this daily and as the directions say. I missed a few days here and there and my nails began to show it, they got soft again. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those with ghastly nails like I had!"
104432,0,"I was originally excited to be able to try Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin facial cleanser as a BzzAgent member. I have to say, however, that I was somewhat disappointed in the product. When I first applied the cleanser to my face, I noticed that it had a slight fragrance to it, even though it was supposed to be fragrance free. The odor (which I would say is neither pleasant nor unpleasant) wasn't a strong one, but it was present nonetheless. As I began massaging the product into my skin as directed, I noticed it had a somewhat ""greasy"" feel to it which I am unaccustomed to in a facial cleanser. This ""greasy"" consistency, also made it more difficult to thoroughly rinse the product from my face. Once I was finished, I was left with the feeling that my face wasn't totally clean. The one good thing about this product is that it did not cause any adverse reactions to my skin, but I have to say I would most likely not purchase it in the future. (I'm a BzzAgent and I received this product free from BzzAgent. I received no monetary compensation for my open and unbiased review.)"
46183,1,"I love the scent of roses, and yet, I hate the feel of a heavy cream on my skin. This glycerine and rosewater body cream is so light that it melts right into your skin. And the 16 oz. size for this price is a very good deal as it lasts a very long time. Camille Beckman 16 Oz. Silky Body Cream, Glycerine Rosewater"
234373,2,"I was looking for to try this lipstick, but when I received it, I was very disappointed ,it was rancid, had a horrible smell, it must have been very old.I had to trash it! What a waste of money!!!"
250450,2,The mirror looked fine but the light switch wouldn't even turn on.Very disappointed as this was sent as a birthday gift and had to be returned. I would not try this brand again - it didn't even rate 1 star. The only good part of the whole deal was Amazon's painless return policy and process.
949,2,"In a nutshell, not enough wattage to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. I'd also appreciate a shorter cord. I love the idea of this device, the straightening element works well for me. My hair is coarse and very wavy, always frizzy unless I straighten, so I really wanted to like this product. My friend who has finer, thinner hair than mine loves it. However, the 700 watt power makes styling take forever. I may as well dry and then iron, since it would be faster. Still, I'll probably keep this for travel, since it's very portable."
134314,1,"I have never used higher end hair products until I recently cut my hair. The salon I went to pushes Redken, but I purchased this product on Amazon because it was more affordable than expected. The product works great with my hair. I have medium thick, coarse hair that with the new haircut requires me to flat iron it a lot to get the look I want. This product seems to keep my hair looking healthy and shiny and repairs the damage done by the flat iron. It makes my hair feel so soft and smooth and also smells really good. Doesn't weight it down or build up over time like some of the grocery store hair products. Overall a great product for distressed, damaged hair."
146620,2,I loved my SEDU while it was working but one day it just stopped... When you pay $125 for a straightner you expect it should last a least a year. I had fabulous results my hair was very straight and shiny but not worth the money i paid for it when it broke after 6 months. I had read the reviews before i purchased it so i knew it could break easily so i make sure to take extra good care of it. Apparently it didn't matter.... They need to make a more durable product....
62102,1,"I've been going to Aveda to get my hair dyed a medium golden brown, and while it turned out pretty, I always hated paying as much money as I did to get it dyed. Not only that, but my hair seemed fried afterwords (and that was for dying it darker than my natural color...I didn't bleach it). It would feel slightly crunchy and dry and really itchy when I laid down on my pillow at night. I decided to try out Tints of Nature in Shade 4N and what a great idea! The color was PERFECT and I never felt like my hair was dry, brittle, or crunchy. Nor did I have the same problem with itchy scalp when trying to go to bed for the next couple of days after my hair ""calmed down"" like I did with the Aveda dye job. My hair felt very soft and looked shiny and smelled great! Plus it's about a third of the price and takes about half the time."
134802,0,I like products that control frizz but leaves my hair feeling natural. This leaves my hair feeling stiff and unnatural.It does control the frizz though.
121522,0,"The scissors are good, most people would like them just fine, but I had an earlier pair, and liked them better, and couldn't replace them."
33081,2,"I bought the mini version of Dolce And Cabbana and did not think they would sell me a ""not for Sale"" product for 15.98 including shipment-costs. After sending right an email on which Beauty Encounter not responded, I called them and they said they are allow to sell ""not for sale"" samples because they buy them from the manufacturer. I pointed out to the customer service representative that the perfume also was not the real one, because it had almost no odor of the Feminine smell. She said that that is not possible. They sent an email with the wrong perfume name on it and after calling again, they did resend one with the right name so no I can return it.Bottom line: I do not recommend this seller."
80106,0,"i decided to try this product b/c of the other reviews, and i do think that this mask works just as well as morroccan oil, or bumble & bumble curl concious or creme de cocoa masks, which i have been using for a while. The great thing about the macadamia oil mask is 1) the price, you cant beat it and 2) it really does make your hair very very soft & silky & 3)the jar is huge! i have thick, frizzy, curly, dry red hair, and i've used so many expensive products on my hair to try and tame it. this mask is very thick & coats well. plus you get a huge jar for a fraction of the cost of what the other masks are. the reason i took off 2 stars for this product is b/c it has a very very strong scent. I prefer products that are frangrace free or just have whatever natural scent the ingredients give it, i cant stand scents, especially floury perfumy scents like this one has. i used this mask last night, and the scent has stayed with me all day, giving me a headache. if you are sensitive to scents or fragrance, i dont recommend this mask. but the price, quality and size of the jar definatly make this a great product."
100825,1,"I was looking for a FAT crayon eye-liner pencil and this is what I thought I wanted but it IS VERY fat! and so I don't know how I am going to sharpen it.It's hard to draw a ""line"" too so I just draw one ""in general."" I probably won't buy it again."
154062,1,"This stuff is fantastic. Being a ""ginger"" I need protection from the sun almost all year long. Last year I spent 193 days on the water chasing big fat trout. Could not have done it without my Aloe Gator SPF 40!! Have tried them all, but this is the best without question."
63806,0,"I have very frizzy hair. My hair is naturally straight (very slight wave) & oily. I live in a sub-tropical humid climate that contributes to the frizz. (FYI-I have long length blonde hair) I am always looking to improve my hair's unruly behavior without having to constantly use hairspray,gel, or other hair styling products. If I could find one great product to control a lot of the frizz without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick then I would be a happy camper. This spray smells awesome but just seems to do an OK job. From my own experience, the price I paid for the results was not worth it. However, I like the Sexy Hair brand; I guess that's why I was hoping this product would deliver. If at all possible to try the product out before purchasing, I would suggest to do so."
128113,0,"I was a bit disappointed that the hot air brush I recently purchased didn't have morepower. I knew it only had two settings, but I thought it would have more blowing power. I have owned several and this one doesn't dry as well as the others. The tongs on the end of the brush should be more rounded or have soft tips on the ends. The price was good and I could not find any brushes in retail stores, so I was happy to have found a hot air brush."
148303,0,"It wasnt exactly what i thought i would be but a pretty good exfoliator..DO NOT scrub hard as you could possibly damage your skin..since i have adult acne prone skin, it did make me break out...but if it wasnt for the breakout i would have rated it higher...good luck to all who use this & ALWAYS be careful when i comes to your face.."
34254,2,I bought 2 of these for $60.00 and they are perfume and they are 3.4I did buy them last year but I would never pay that much for this even thoughit's one of my fav. I bought mine at Long's Drugs.
147974,0,"I wrote for directions and received information about the product but not how to make it work. Apparently the one I got was a dud. Waste of money.Update -- Okay, I'm an idiot -- it does work -- it is just a little frustrating/difficult to get it started. It is a pretty decent product, actually!"
187532,0,"This is a review for the color ""Shindig""Its a little more pink then I would have expected. I thought it would be more of an orange color. However, the color started to grow on me the longer I wore it. It has a very pretty pearly sort of sheen to it which gives it some interest. Its not my favorite color but I usually lean more toward blues, purples, and greens. The color was quite sheer too. I think it took me about 4 coats to get it to a nice opaqueness. All in all, I don't this I would purchase this color again, but I'll use up the rest of the bottle."
3546,0,It was hard to get the white look to disappear. It burned my skin a little bit. I use retinol and that may have contributed to that.
132517,0,"A well made product, but frustrating to use as the plastic guards over the cutters obscure the position of the nail you are cutting. I know the guards are to protect your toe from getting accidentally cut, but when you can't see what you are cutting the advantage is lost. Seem to be good quality."
147057,1,"This is a wonderful product. It totally got rid of the deep cracks on my feet (heels). Nothing else worked! Because it is a cream, it is thicker and clings to your skin."
147215,0,"The color washes off in a day or two. This is the only disappointment. At this price, it should last a great deal longer. I have not experienced the staining of cuticles and palms that others have reported, and I am a pale, pale girl."
147687,0,"I actually like this product very much. It has always worked well for me. Switching it on is kind of like lighting an old-fashioned butane lighter (i.e., you have to click it a few times). The only downsides are that it is difficult to find the replacement cells or the curling iron and, since 9/11 you can't really travel with flamable butane cartridges."
117256,2,It didn't work well. Not enough heat or steam. Hair got stuck in it. I sent it back. They were excellent on the return and my credit. Thank you!
78893,0,"I used this stuff for about 2 years before stopping. First of all, it's really expensive - and really easy to make yourself (cheaper) according to my sister who is in pharmacy school. Second of all, it burns like hellllll. I even have a fair pain tolerance. Thirdly, I stopped because it didn't seem to be working like it used to. I switched to Anthony's logistics for men - still expensive but doesn't sting and works wonderfully."
155176,0,I bought this because I heard so much about it and maybe it was BECAUSE I heard so much about it that I was kind of disappointed. I do love the fact that it only takes 5 minutes though. It makes me be more regular about using a mask which is good no matter what.
228342,2,"Ordered this items and another, both were Prime Eligible and Both did not get here till a Week later.This was a gift,and I ended up buying locally..."
4463,1,"I hate mascara shopping! Can never find a true brown. A friend told me about this one, in deep auburn. It goes great with my strawberry blonde hair. They quit selling it around here, so I'm glad to see Amazon has it. And, it actually has a real brush, not those plastic things!"
121286,1,Love this scent. Definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while. Perfect for everyday wear. It has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that's not your bag I wouldn't recommend it.
79926,2,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this product. I have highlighted curly hair that is very very dry and damaged. I left this on for 10 minutes, when the recommended is 7, and still it didn't do anything. The only thing about it that I really like is the smell, and I would much rather have a product work, than smell good. Overall, way to pricey for some good smelling conditioner."
234912,0,Lol if its fake just because it comes with a sponge why is it on thier site? N i have nt used this product but once i find out my color im trying it.
10093,2,"Why did you change your formula!! I loved your old formulat and have mixed two shades together for many years: 18rg and 28. This new formula doesn't mix well and my hair is like a teased mess after I shampoo! I have to use huge amounts of conditioner just in order to comb my hair after I shower. Please bring back the old formula - it was wonderful. Before , I had shiny, beautiful hair even with a perm and coloring - no more!"
138698,1,"This curling iron is fantastic! Easy to use, affordable and curls last all day! I've received many compliments on my curls since I started using it. Great buy!"
199198,0,1. Item didn't look like brand new.2. Perfume didn't smell exactly as it should probably because it's not on market for few years.3. Amazon has great return service. However in order to return perfume you should contact Amazon directly.
227604,1,"This perfume does not have the same fragrance as the regular Ellen Tracy, hence the name ""Limited Edition."" However, I found it every bit as delightful, if not more so. It is becoming a rare thing to locate this particular fragrance, and I am quite pleased to find it on Amazon.This fragrance is for a mature woman, I would say someone professional and perhaps age 35 and up. I wear it both for daytime and evening, and have had many compliments."
12602,0,Mild scrub not a ton of product... Good for once a week. Not their best product for the price. Probably would try one of their others instead
125425,0,"I feel neutral about this product. When I first applied it and let my hair dry, my hair felt crunchy and some areas looked like it was still wet. So I brushed it out. I really like the way it made my hair look - my hair is naturally curly, but when I brushed it out my hair had big waves/curls. Even though I thought my hair looked great, there was a ridiculous residue left on the brush. My brand-new hairbrush went from black to white and crusty in 30 seconds flat. It was gross! I didn't even put a large amount of this stuff in my hair. I like the look that I achieve with this product, but I'm still not sure about it. It just seems like it has too many cons."
88988,1,"This thing is fantastic! It works- tried and true like ALL Head & Shoulder's shampoo's. But man, it smells fantastic! May be the Almond Oil but it's a great shampoo and I will be using it forever and ever."
17039,0,"My hair was nice and shiny for the first few days after I used this product. I've noticed that a lot of color washes out when you wash your hair, so it fades quickly. The odor was average for this type of product. I'm not sure I'd use this one again."
130322,1,"It's opaque pink with just enough shimmer - I use it on my toes, the shimmer is barely visable, and it holds your pedicure longer"
187364,1,"I was hesitate in ordering this on line, but not only am glad I did the lotion is what I had been looking for. I am very,very happy with my order. I like how they let me know every step that was going on with my order and got it in a timely manner,in less than a week!!! This was the only place I could find the Celine Dion lotion and I am a Happy customer I will shop again with Amazon.com."
231236,0,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
157235,1,This cream was recommended to me by a doctor to use as a sexual lubricant! It works as promised...not leave you feeling greasy...and Amazon was the only place that I could track it down.
168412,1,"I bought two of this because my sisters, enrolled in a beauty salon school, and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!"
141934,1,"After trying the first Daily Facials I realized there had to be a way to improve these cloths. It seems they have made the cloths much more effective for oily skin. I also noticed the oily skin ones were a bit soapier (although they are soap-free).Each cloth is folded oh so neatly in the little plastic container and all you do is buy a refill of the cleansing clothes when you run out.This container contains 30 clothes for deep cleansing. They have a wonderful scent and seem to work very well to remove make-up and even mascara. These do actually work in place of our normal face wash or cleansing milk routine.You just wet the cloths with water, cleanse your face and rinse.Ingredients: Petrolatum, PEG-100, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Cyclodextrin, Butylene Glycol, PEG-14M, Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (witch hazel extract), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy), Panthenol (pro-vitamin B5), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Parfum (fragrance), Menthol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Niacinamide, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium MA/Diisobutylene Copolymer, Silica, BHT, Sodium LaurateIdeal for traveling since there is nothing to spill!~The Rebecca Review"
102837,2,"Product was as shown and described. However, it is too rough for my face. I believe a smaller size would be softer, so that's what I will order next."
249807,0,"I absolutely adored these rollers when I first purchased them after reading about them in a Harper's Bazaar article on the hair set and it's big comeback to NYC salons. What I loved so much was that because they are mesh and air flows through them so easily, my hair dries incredibly fast when I air dry and especially when I use a dryer.However, now that I've had them for some months, the metal coils inside are starting to separate, and the mesh that wraps around them is not closed, so that mesh starts to slip off and the coils start to separate which makes it hard to wrap hair flat around the curler - it ends up bulking into one spot on the curler and hair doesn't dry properly or nicely.I'm considering trying other rollers, since these clearly don't have a long life."
8264,1,"This is truly an amazing product. It is very expensive, but definitely worth it. I especially use it on my feet after a long day of walking or dancing when the feet are really throbbing and it really does provides instant relief. I have recommended it to many friends, who have also had success with it."
154525,1,"I've always used my fingers or brushes to blend but I decided to try this sponge. It's awesome! I couldn't believe what a huge difference it made, both in ease of blending and how much better my makeup looked! It may seem a little expensive at first but trust me, it's well worth it. It's easy to use, just dampen it slightly and use it to stipple on whatever product you like, or to blend. Awesome!"
14694,0,"I've used many moisturizers. I will not buy this one again, it's okay for the price but I would rather spend a little more for better quality."
96081,1,I received this hand cream as a gift and I absolutely LOVE it. I am very picky when it comes to hand lotion because I want it to be thick and motorizing with a nice scent. The scent is very light and clean smelling. This is the perfect combination for a hand lotion!
110760,0,"I have not had enough time to decide about this product. It seems fine but it has to be applied every day or so. The 24 hours nail hardener name is kind of mis-leading. I have been using it for about a week, applying it every day or so and have not noticed a significant difference."
206655,2,"I was delighted to read that Amazon was selling Must De cartier, but when i received the toilette spray the pump on the sprayer did not work."
204823,0,"This arrived in only 4 days, and one day was a holiday, which was great. It does smell bad, very much like bug spray, but that mostly dissipates after a while. I'm 36 with normal/borderline oily skin, and it seems to make my eye area a little too greasy (I use very little at a time). It does plump up my fine lines. It may be much better for more mature skin. It's my own fault for not clueing in to the ""balm"" part in the name. I am now only using it as a heavy moisturizer for at night, and will continue to look for a less smelly/greasy cream for the daytime. I will honestly probably not buy this again, it just didn't work out for me."
49489,1,"I love this product. Over the years my face has become sensative to many heavier moisturizers. The Normal/Combination Skin version of this product is light and doesn't make my face break out. I was really bummed that Nordstrom's stopped carrying it, and was thrilled to see it still available via Amazon.com. I would definitely recommend as a daily moisturizer."
177838,2,"If you don't care about hazardous chemicals getting absorbed into your body while using this product, use it, because it does work well. Most people see that it is ""Sulfate Free"" and they assume it doesn't have harmful chemicals. That is an incorrect assumption!"
105186,0,Works well on mobilizing excess arm fat; tightening of the skin is less dramatic.It may be hard on the skin if you have any skin senstivity. My daughter's skin remains very red after using it for a few weeks.
179483,1,I really like this little eyeshadow. The brush is part of the lid so it's easy to hang on to. I like the dark brown and beige. My eyes are blue/gray and it makes my eyes look great.I would like to buy more of these in other shades. I also like the shadow because it is matte and doesn't have added glimmer because glimmer shows wrinkles. It goes on smoothly and lasts untill you wash it off at night.It's a keeper.
100182,1,Amazing Concealer is truly amazing. I have used every type of concealer imaginable and nothing works as well as this one. This product completely covers under-eye dark circles as well as other facial flaws and it is light and natural looking. It is expensive but a little bit goes a long way.
142288,0,"This is a unusually good price for this type of human hair.It isn't the best quality, and I dyed it to match, my color.The hair is really porus and has a lot of little knots, so the conditioner really made a difference.Premium NOW is a much better quality product than Premium Too (Sensationnel) hair.This normally retails at around $28-30 per pack.All the products that work for taking care of curly hair, will work on this hair.I recommend product to keep this looking natural, and washing it 1x per week."
172919,2,Well to start with it didn't arrive for two weeks... When it did come the shipping box was all banged up and product packaging was completely opened. I used product as directed and when I woke up in the morning my face was so swollen and burnt looking it was bright red and bubbly looking. I have had a very large boil like pimple on my cheek ever since I used this product.
239040,2,This cologne doesn't smell like the one I buy from Macy's...... there was no smell waste of money. I want to return itIf anyone has the info on how to return items please let me know that you.
250018,2,"It is not very powerful. The air does not circulate well and the hose is short. I was never able to fit the bonnet, hose and cord in the tiny carry area. And it died after about 10 uses."
228180,0,"not a good product for the curly headed.....made my hair SUPER dry so i had to use another conditioner after i used the f.a.s.t conditioner just to make if feel somewhat normal...used it for a month and saw no real results, my hair grew at it's normal rate"
243776,1,"I've been bothered with occasionally breakouts and acnes and this product really is a very potent, fragrance-free topical disinfectant for blemishes"
228252,0,"This brush is not bad for the price but the boar bristles are too short. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit more and I think it would be a better investment if the boar bristles were longer and the nylon didn't stick out as much. Plus I felt somewhat cheated when I noticed that in between the half-length boar bristles there is nylon as well, it's the same length so you can hardly see it. Since I have pretty thick hair I like that it goes through fully to my scalp and my hair has been more shiny and manageable since I got it. The ambassador brush w/same features looks better though and I wish I'd bought that instead plus the price difference is not that much."
129055,1,"I bought this because I thought it would better if I used both china glaze for the base and top coat. Although I love the base coat, this is not my favorite. My nail polish begins to chip after only a day. I prefer Nicole top coat (I think its by OPI)."
120695,2,"I couldn't wait to open my new Ultimate Concealer when it arrived. I thought I was getting the purest and most beneficial makeup on the market. But as I read the ingredient list, my heart fell.This is a complete list of the ingredients:Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Jojoba Esters, Polyethylene, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Propylparaben, DimethiconeMay Contain:Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, CI 77499, MicaThis list was taken directly off of the package. Obviously there are many more ingredients than what is listed officially on this page or on Youngblood's website. Make your own decision about whether or not you are comfortable putting some of these ingredients on your face every day."
102676,0,This mask was ok but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. It does beat other eye gel masks out there though.
146475,0,"I have been taking Viviscal for about 8 months. The effect, if any, is not obvious. I am not sure I will continue after finishing what I have. I took Hairmega 3-1 before. It worked better than Viviscal, but only for about six months. I wish I could find something really working for me."
229198,2,Bought this kit and had it express-shjipped so we could use it while we were still on vacation. Followed the instructions to the letter. Henna ink was thick and too congealed to apply (probably old). Nobody should have to pay for junk like this. No way to get a refund - only thick gunk left.STRONGLY RECOMMEND that nobody buy this kit!!
32254,0,"Well, the more I wear it, the more I like it, but I'm disconcerted by a couple of things. First, the family sold the perfume to a company who relaunched it in 1999, and I know nothing about this company's commitment to quality. Second, the packaging states that the fragrance has been ""updated"" for modern tastes. I see that as a euphemism for substituting original for cheaper or synthetic ingredients. I was hoping for something complex and profound, and while Bandit is growing on me, it is far from a signature scent."
113439,2,I read the reviews and i took the chance. What more can i say? Bought the Dryer July 20th and it stopped working today. The heat just stopped. It now only blows cold air. I've always bought my hairdryers at wal-mart. Just basic $20-$30 dryers and they lasted for years. Unfortunately this one just barely made 6 months. I wouldn't mind but it was the most expensive one i ever bought and no warranty cause i bought on Amazon. I will also add that i never really noticed too much of a difference from the $20-$30 ones i've bought.
222649,0,"I just got this from amazon, the trimmer is not bad. the small one that comes with it that runs on a AA batteries, is awesome. WORKS great. the main trimmer is kind of annoying to use, you would have to adjust the power flow, until you get it right, after that it works like a charm. The finishing is really cheap on it, but what can you expect for the price. It does come with a 5 year manf warranty"
67933,1,"I have used this product CONSISTENLY for the past 4-5 months. If you follow the directions and use it as instructed it WILL work. The secret is to NOT give up and if you have to use it daily for 6 weeks as I did, due to thick hair, then you should. Now it is only twice a week. I had dark brown/gray hair when I started. It is now TOTALLY dark brown. It even darkened the hard to color hair at my temples. People, who I have not seen for a few months, are amazed when I tell them that I do not dye my hair. If you don't like it's low keyed fragrance you can always buy African Pride hair deodorizer which comes in a variety of scents. I prefer the cucumber melon. It masks the scent of the Greyban as well as cigarette odor if you smoke (I don't). All you need to do with the Greyban is GIVE IT TIME AND USE IT REGULARLY."
199054,1,"I ordered a chi on Thursday and it came in the mail on Friday! It's brand new and works perfectly. I found the same product in stores for $120 more than I paid here! I am THRILLED with this purchase.As for how it works GREAT on long hair. Nothing saves more time or does a better job. The only issue that can arise is heat damage, but that's with any straightener. Keep your setting low and you'll be fine. It saves so much TIME! You can run your hair through it once and it's perfectly flat (and I have very long hair and live in an extremely humid area). It's a lifesaver!"
213489,0,I wasn't able to use this long enough to determine if it worked to alleviate the symptoms of my stress induced hair loss because I was too impatient with the fact it doesn't lather. I don't feel like my hair gets clean without a nice lather!
36738,1,"Sedu straighteners are AMAZING. I work in a salon and they sell some high-end ceramic hair straighters for over $[...] each. However, the Sedu straighters are WAY more easier on your hair. They glide over the hair like silk, and I don't find that the expensive other-brand ceramic straighters feel silky when I glide them over my hair. I don't know about ordering Sedu products overseas like the other customer did ([...]), but the Sedu corporate office is here in the US in New Jersey. The ceramic or whatever its called, when it heats and up and you glide it down your hair, it is super smooth and there is no tugging on your hair. LOVE IT. I wish they would make curling irons but I don't think they do."
92348,0,"Essie has some very beautiful colors, but all the nailpolishes have formaldehyde. There are other brands that also have pretty colors and are Big 3 free. Would not recommend this product. 3 stars for the color selection."
26873,0,"I had smelt a sample at the local department stores and loved the smell. When I ordered it through amazon it would seem very reliable and it did, it got here quickly, reasonable price BUT when I had sprayed this, it does not last!! At first, the smell stays on for a few minutes but as time passes it on, you can hardly smell any fragrance. The only way to smell this is grab your shirt and hold it to your nose. The one I had smelt at my local department store was a 1oz bottle and the smell was fresh through out the day and night. The one I have received feels like a cheap knock off or I might have been the unlucky one. Never buying again from online and will always stick with the department store."
189660,1,"I discovered this while traveling in Ireland and it is my favorite soap. It has a wonderful aroma that is fresh and clean but not ""perfumey"". It makes me feel relaxed. The soap is very smooth and silky too. Love it."
80342,0,I used this thinner on a lot of old polishes and it restored about 2/3 of the ones that I used it on. It's very easy to use and it does work on even really old nail polish as long as it's not completely dried out or extremely thick and globby. I did have to add a lot of drops for the polishes and I probably added around 20 to the majority of bottles. It didn't change the quality or finish of the nail polishes.
66546,2,"After being swayed by the reveiws here and getting wise to the warranty situation, I made a point of purchasing this product in a nearby beauty supply store who is an authorized seller and thought I was getting a bargain at $125. I bought it in the hopes of taming the huge, round, coarse frizzball sitting on my head.Let me note for the skeptical that the product was brand new, unopened in the box and in obvious mint condition. It is an authentic T3 hairdryer. Yes, it dried faster, but left a noticeably dull, dry finish and seemed to strip my hair of it lustre. Not only that but I couldn't get the ends of my hair to lie straight after they had already shriveled up in the fast drying process, and the more I struggled with the ends the more flyaway my hair became. And it appears to be MORE voluminous than ever - bigger and puffier and with the same amount of frizz, only duller looking.I immediately plugged it out and plugged in my old, falling apart Babyliss Carerra (non-ionic) dryer and afer a few minutes managed to get the ends straight and see some lustre return. I agree completely with the reviewer who made the comment about losing the healthy shine.I only hope I can get my money back. I will certainly try.UPDATE - Comparison of T3 Tourmaline to less expensive Babyliss ProTTthough I couldn't get my money back, I exchanged the T3 for a Babyliss ProTT 3000 Tourmaline dryer (I'd have stayed away from Tourmaline ionic infrared labels but apparently it's all the rage and very difficult to find a nice lowtech one that doesn't incorporate this technology).Like the T3, the Babyliss is also really lightweight, dries as fast or faster than the T3, and has the added benefit of more heat settings - including medium, low, and high, as well as a cool shot, whereas the T3 only offers a high heat and low heat. The Babyliss has 1900 watts and the T3 has 1800. There are various models of the Bablyiss tourmaline, but this model was at the lower end of the price range at $89, and you can get it on Amazon for about $20 less.It is for the above reasons and others I'm about to detail that it is a superior product to the T3. Not only does it cost much less but the Babyliss gave my hair a soft, lustrous, shiny smooth sheen and healthy texture, and did not leave it looking dried out and fried as the T3 did.That said, I still experienced the same problem w/the Babyliss as with the T3- it gives too much volume to my short, thick choppy layered hair and doesn't allow me to straighten it at any heat setting. What I saved in drying time (easily fifteen minutes without sweating and straining my arm) I paid for dearly in styling time to try to get the full balloon-y volume to calm down and get the ends to lay flat.In sum, I would strongly recommend saving your money on the T3 and buying the Babyliss if you want to see not merely identical but significantly improved functionality and performance over the more expensive T3 dryer. Yet I would still be less likely to recommend this or any other tourmaline-infused infrared dryer for people with very thick, voluminous hair that they want to take the poof out of and make straight, as that will likely not happen with this or similar units. As a final but very significant note on performance - the Babyliss toned down my frizz (and it's a very rainy day today) by nearly 100 percent! Also I noticed very few dry flyaways as compared to the T3.In sum, the Babyliss ProTT is an excellent product, a much better choice than the T3. It is more economical, offers greater functionality and superior performance."
219367,1,"It seems ridiculous to rate this product as it is no longer available, and if it is, the price is through the roof. It sold for $6.50 when it was available and is now being sold at $65. I loved the product, but not at that price. Unfortunately Revlon did not produce a substitute. Pity."

89209,0,"UPDATE 10-5-2011: This dryer went ""POP"", began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes. To say it died is incorrect; I turned it off....permanently. It had a lifespan of three years and five months. Is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about $150.00? Not as far as I am concerned. My next ""investment"" in hair dryer futures?Babyliss BABTT5585 TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer.ORIGINAL REVIEW: The hair dryer like the toaster oven, the cell phone, and the corded telephone all are built with obsolescence in mind.My mother owned a chrome Oster hair dryer that lasted for 26 years. Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn't have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that's a complelety different story.About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn't dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation. It was about 3x more expensive than the crappy dryers I was used to but if it made my hair better it would be worth it. Or so I reasoned.So far, the dryer has been proficient.Pros:-The dryer is very lightweight.-Its well balanced and easy to hold.-I have very thick, wavy-straight hair and the dryer allows me a blow out in about half the time.-The heat seems to be very consistant. Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn't get hotter.-It is relatively quiet.-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don't get gunked up.-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don't you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?-The cord is a good, generous length, 114"" for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.Cons:-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating. This is my biggest gripe with the dryer.-I don't see much of a difference in the frizz department. I purchased the optional diffuser and my hair seems to be as frizzy as ever, tourmaline or not.-My hair is still not luminous and movie star perfect. Sob.So far, the dryer has lasted. I doubt I will get 26 years of use, but lets see what happens.-"
201929,0,Nice nail color however chips by day 6.. Right price but overpriced for shipping. I purchased another nail color from them at the same time. I got two shipping charges when both nailpollishes come in the same $3 shipping/us postage paid envelope ! I paid $12 in shipping. What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
227063,1,"I bought this color because I was told it replaced limited edition vampire state building which is no longer available, very pleased and fast shipping."
180499,1,"I was first introduced to this fragrance in 1996 when Saks Fifth Avenue had it as an exclusive. I am a fan of Thierry Mugler's clothing so it was only natural that I would be open to trying his scent. Unlike many designer scents, ""Angel for Men"" is a distinctive, elegant scent. Sensual is a term that comes to mind also. The communion of different scents makes for a very unique product. I combine it with Khiels Coconut Body Lotion (unfortunately Khiels no longer makes coconut lotion, however, one of their body lotions have a coconut scent that works almost as well). Saks Fifth Avenue offered a monogrammed metal flask when it was first launched at a special price. I bought it and it was a smart move.It has become my signature scent. Nothing was so cool than to hear my best friend say that I don't wear too much, it is just the way that I smell. I have tried the Body Creme which is made for women. But if used sparingly, it is a great foundation that allows me to smell that way for an extended period. I also have used the body wash/shampoo. Obviously, I love this scent.It is not cheap but it doesn't require a lot to unleash its great scents.Angel Men has gotten me a lot of compliments from women so men looking for that approval won't be disappointed.I cannot say enough about Angel for Men. If there is anything disappointing, after overall a decade of being sold at exclusive shops like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, etc. Walgreens has begun carrying it. But it was an exclusive for over a decade and a half so I guess mass merchandising had to kick in.But that's no big deal. It takes nothing away from this being a winning scent!"
249837,0,"The tube is correctly labeled for LIGHT natural brown. However, the color comes out a very dark brown. If this is truly their idea of light brown, then I would have to order a blond color to get light brown. Ordered two tubes, so am hoping the other tube is an ACTUAL light brown color."
197096,0,"I think this chi is a fake. I have a real one purchased from Target that died after a few years and then purchased this one. Doesn't heat up as well, and is very light. Works pretty well nonetheless. I recommend this one over the cheaper ones you can get at the store."

71607,2,didn't even lighten my roots. I'm going back to preference light ash blonde pro keratin. And my hair was like straw. I was angry that I had to deep condition for 3 days straight. Pissed.
47625,2,"I'll start off with the good: the smell. And that's where the good ends. The shampoo is so drying and harsh. The conditioner looks thick and creamy, but does nothing to relieve that dryness that the shampoo causes. Usually you can comb your fingers through your hair when the conditioner is in, but I'm lucky if I can get a brush through my hair. I spent at least 10 minutes combing out knots from hair...knots that weren't in my hair before I used Organix. I so wanted this product to work because is smells so amazing but I will be looking for another coconut product that actually works!"
225031,0,"It do not have this model hence the 3 stars, but recently purchased the Revlon flat iron that has a rounded edge for about the same price point. It could not straighten a baby's hair. My hair is wavy but not curly. The heat is so low and never fully come up to a temp that is useful. I was using an old Hot Tools model and did not want to spend big bucks on a ceramic salon iron but was very disappointed with my new purchase. Make sure your iron goes to 400 degrees f or you will not get a good product plus after research I found that plated ceramic irons can chip easily and reveal the metal plate underneath that snags your hair. In this case it really does pay to get a quality iron and you can get them a great prices on EBAY ( you don't have to spend more than $50). Don't waste your time on this."

9215,0,"The clips have a hard time holding onto my hair. I have very fine hair and these clips aren't tight enough to hold it. The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on. I also don't care for the lines left in my hair from the plates on the clips. I want my hair curled, not crimped!This thing is big, too. Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom and I find it teetering off the edge, very dangerous, especially with the exposed hot metal.I did like that these heated up fast and I will continue to use them, but only leave them in a couple minutes before the crimp lines start to set in. I also like the flocked roller. I just wish they'd had the whole clip covered with the plate so it wouldn't leave the lines in my hair and I wish they'd find a way to make a smaller unit."

9582,2,"It feels as if it's expired. It doesn't go on smoothly at all, and it requires a special sharpener. Overpriced"
9960,0,"Ingredients: The ingredients seem well enough, not fantastic, not bad. Theres a few chemicals that can be expected, but it also contains several ingredients that are good for the hair.Results: If you think that this is going to magically save your hair from the effects of a hot iron, your wrong. In fact, ive stopped using any hot tools completely and my hair length and health has improved drastically. But if you want some protection thrown in there when you use hot tools once in a while, this is a great choice and i highly reccommend it. Just keep in mind that if you hot iron your hair everyday, even with deep conditioners, and protective products such as these, your still not going to fully protect your hair from the damage.Alternatives: This may sound crazy, but instead of flat ironing my course, curly hair, i use two bandanas. i tie the first one around my forhead and tie it behind my ears then pull it back slightly. then i take my ponytail put it up on top of my head, and tie another bandana the opposite way and tie it by my forehead. I then bobby pin them so it doesnt fall off while i sleep. i do this after i wash my hair, it drys naturally, and its frizz free and smooth when i take it off. (make sure its dry though) then you can preceed to style your hair. its very easy if you wash your hair at night."

88602,2,"On me this lipstick was a peachy, rust brown color with a matte finish that was really unattractive.My skin is very light with a touch of pink so I thought ""Blushing"" meant a touch of pink in the colorbut that was not the outcome. Think it would probably be much better on someone with a darker, warmer skin tone.Glad it was a gift with purchase from Clinique. The lipstick goes on easily & is moisturizing so I will try the pinkerversions of this product."
168618,1,"I like this gloss. It has a nice smooth, non sticky texture and the color issheer enough to be natural looking but has enough pigment to be seen and notlook washed out. It smells great and and I love the little brush wand. I'dbuy it again."
107661,0,"Whether this is a genuine product or not, i can't say as i didn't buy it off amazon, but this is a review of the actual CK One fragrance. Initially, it was a pleasing fragrance i enjoyed. But it's one of those scents that gets old really fast. I bought it and wore it only a couple of times then i could no longer stand it. I haven't worn it since and ended up giving the bottle away. If you like it, i'd say buy it in a trial size. If after you use that you still like it, then buy the full size."

183452,0,Nozzle is narrow so the velocity is high and concentrated. Even on high heat it is not that hot however it seems like it is industrial grade.
128848,0,This smells just like Magnetism to me. I can't tell the differenc. I ordered this product from amazon and I am wondering if they have magnetism perfume in a Magnetic beat bottle. I am going to the department stores to see if this is how Magnetic Beat really smells
18856,0,"I have VERY oily skin that breaks out so I started using BE hoping to get better coverage than my liquid foundation. Well...It looks great right after you ""buff"" it on. It leaves a soft finish, feels like nothing at all, and takes just seconds to apply - much better than having to use my make up sponge to blend for 10 minutes! I use the concealer brush on my nose to get rid of the powder settled into pores look and on my forehead to get rid of the powder settled into the furrow lines look (I'm in my late 20's, so not too many lines). Sounds good so far, but the problem comes about 2 hours after I put it on. The powder settles back into any fine lines, if I wear sunglasses they leave two little spots on the bridge of my nose where the sunglasses rested, and because of my oily skin, the powder starts to look streaky on my nose and forehead. After about 4 hours, I have to rebuff some foundation on and use more mineral veil or I'll be super shiny and streaky. In the winter, the powder ends up all over my jacket collars - it has NO staying power at all. Basically, BE is perfect for people with perfect skin (not dry, not oily) who don't have high collars on their jackets!"
226891,0,.the smell last for 5 hours..very good money spend in this product....I will recomend this product...
35384,0,I was very pleased when I got this perfume and used it right away. Every perfume performs differently on each person. I did not find it long lasting on me. My daughter tried it and loved it. I gave it to her and she is very happy with it.
5287,0,At first I thought that I loved this product. But I started to notice that my face would get SUPER oily about 1/2 way through the day. It does do a great job covering up and giving an even skin tone. I finally decided to try other foundations due to the excessive oiliness I was experiencing and it made a big difference. I now use Nutrogeana's powder foundation.

The EDT wears well through the day without being too strong. Those who want more punch may prefer the eau de parfum."
181294,0,"After much fretting, I finally obtained a sample from the local Sephora store...and am glad I didn't buy it, cuz I'm a floral, clean type of girl.The first word came to mind is ""sweet"", a sweet, sugary smell, with a hint of musk. If you like your perfums sweet and musky, then this is good for you.Some perfum are too strong when just sprayed, this one is not. It is subtly sophisticated, and smells nice (cheap perfums always have a hint of chemical smells, and this one does not).It is good quality perfum, but if you don't like sweet or musky scent, don't buy it."

It controlled my frizz while defining my curls all without making it crunchy. Perfect! Until they changed it recently. It doesn't work the same way anymore. My hair is frizzy even after using it and it doesn't do anything to enhance the curls..Very disappointing. Please bring the old product back! :("
28444,1,"This is a classy vintage fragrance that still works today. My grandmother wore this perfume all her life after she smelled it in the 1930's on a woman wearing a fur coat with fresh violets pinned to it. She never tired of the scent and it was her signature until she died at 102. I have worn Bellodgia off and on for many years and have always found that the eau de toilette has great staying power without being overwhelming. Although I am not as faithful to it as my grandmother was, I keep coming back to it as a classic, warm scent that is flowery, spicy and sophisticated."

It's gentle and it's cheep in comparison to laser treatments with no recovery time.It smells pretty good and makes your skin feel soft.I'm going to tell my Mom about this,she suffers terribly from rosacea.

While this mirror would be fine for many, for me I just felt like eventually the handle will crack if moved too suddenly since it was so top heavy and by the handle swaying and bending when moving it. I didn't want that while I was trying to trim the hair on the back of my head."

232043,2,"I really like Peter Thomas Roth's products, which are made with cutting-edge science and have been uniformly top skin care performers. however, after about a month of using this product as per the instructions, I saw absolutely no reduction in any wrinkling, nor any positive change at all. I guess it just didn't work for me. I'll stick to his Mega Rich Cellular Creme, which DOES give me noticeable, great results in wrinkle reduction as well as moisturizing my oily yet dry skin."
50795,0,"This particular purchase was somewhat of a disappointment. I'm having to wait much too long between each curler. As it gets older this does happen, but this one is much too slow right now. I'll be writing to Caruso for a replacement."

100886,2,"I bought Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Powder. It is a powder cleanser that lightly suds up when you apply water. I got about three cleansings out of each packet. So the price is not a bad deal. I liked the scent and it seemed to be free of many chemicals. However, I noticed that it was not a good enough cleanser to remove makeup. So if you decide to buy this product you will need to use a toner if you want to make sure your skin is really clean. I used this product for 2.5 weeks, with the Komenuka Bijin Facial lotion. The results: The cleanser did not clean well enough to remove makeup and the lotion was so moisture rich that in the 2.5 weeks of using these products together made my skin break out all over. I am discontinueing use of both products. I would only recommend this product to people with dry or normal skin that never breaks out."
46053,1,I've been wearing this scent since it came out. I have worn several others but I always come back to this one. It's always been a hit. My girlfriend loves it.
160582,0,"The hair dryer doesn't really dry your hair because it blows too cool. There isn't any adjustment dial to increase the heat. There is a botton to press to make it even coolerThe air is too cool on your head especially in the winter after you get out of a hot shower. The design is very nice and the attachment are nice as well. wouldn't purchase again, I will most likely give it away at some point. Thank you."
197415,2,"This is a terrible product. It doesn't have a way to adjust the temperature and it doesn't get very hot. You can tell that it is some kind of knock-off, there are typos on the printed text on the box. The body is rickety, it feels like the two irons are going to come apart. There's a reason this product is so cheap...it's cheap!"

111652,2,"I've had two Revlon hairdryers over the past year and this one worked better than the subsequent one. I think I may have escaped burning my hair by taking the back filter off of it; my dryer also sparked but I realized it was because it was overheating. Taking the filter off the back creates better air intake and I guess fixed the problem (and I avoided, apparently, setting my hair on fire).Of course, you shouldn't have to do this, and doing so creates further problems. The filter is there to keep your hair from being sucked into the back of the hairdryer, so for the rest of its life I had to be insanely careful of how I held it. Unfortunately, even my drastic efforts didn't save it--it only lasted about six months. The transformer somehow stopped working.The worst part of my experience is that I bought another one, albeit a different model. I tend to blame technical difficulties on user error, but I can see in this case I was not alone. Don't buy this hairdryer; better yet, try another brand."
93765,2,"This edu spray was very disappointing. The initial fragrance was nice and light but it faded away very quickly. I think it lasted about 2 hours, which tells me that it is watered down.The shipment was very quick though. This was the first time I have ordered perfume on line and I will not do it again. I believe it's better to buy fragrances at a store."
186623,0,"I don't do a ton of travel with my makeup right now, hopefully that will change as I find more work as a Make-up Artist in my area. I find that for the price this case will do just fine for now until my makeup collection expands and no longer fits(which is pretty much the case now,lol)however, all of my basics and then some fit quite nicely.I will be upgrading in the future to a roll-a-round kit. I was expecting the case to be somewhat larger than it was when it arrived. I agree with some of the other reviews that the metal sliding hinges seem to be cheaply made and if one isn't careful especially when closing the case, they seem like they could snap in half. I'm glad that the dividers are removable and/or can be customized to fit your needs. However,not only are the dividers made of cheap plastic, but it is especially difficult to move the ones on the second tier around. I like the fact that this case comes with keys,although I'm pretty sure most of them do-even the cheapest ones? Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this product for the price I paid and it arrived super fast!"
231186,0,"This is a review for the color ""Shindig""Its a little more pink then I would have expected. I thought it would be more of an orange color. However, the color started to grow on me the longer I wore it. It has a very pretty pearly sort of sheen to it which gives it some interest. Its not my favorite color but I usually lean more toward blues, purples, and greens. The color was quite sheer too. I think it took me about 4 coats to get it to a nice opaqueness. All in all, I don't this I would purchase this color again, but I'll use up the rest of the bottle."
128920,0,"The scent is really strong. This is fine, I suppose, if you really like the smell of grapefruit. I also have Body Shop sweetpea, cocoa, shea, orange, & lemon, so I do have points of comparison, and this, for me, is too strong while the others are not. The lemon is a little too heavily scented also but not to the same degree."
118888,2,"Bought it mid September 2012, never got dropped / anything but suddenly quit working last week. Called their customer service, without asking question to diagnose what the problem it might be, she just said, it's the bulb and that is not covered under warranty. You have to ship the unit back to us & pay $25 for the bulb plus $9.99 for us to ship back the unit to you. NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS!!! And they said they have 10 years warranty, on WHAT? It could be the electrical item in the unit, who knows? But without even diagnosing they just said it's the part that isn't covered under warranty. What A Warranty. Totally disappointed,!"
186156,0,I paid $62.50 for this product and did not expect to get a tester with a barcode stucked over the tester sign. Testers clearly state that they are not for resale. The spray top is also broken. What a rip-off!

146319,0,"This flat iron is pretty good and gets pretty hot, but it doesn't make your hair silky like a chi or superstar. It also takes a lot longer to get my thick wavy hair straight. I owned a chi for a year and it stopped working, then I bought a superstar which I dropped and it broke all to pieces, so then I bought this one trying to save some money. I miss the results and the time saved with the chi so I'm going to give in and buy another one. You can get them on ebay for $60 - $70 so I would recommend spending a little extra on something that you will actually be happier with."
196817,0,"It's a heck of a lot better than my store bought straightener from Walmart. However, it doesn't work as good as my sisters' Chi, not sure why. But it is pretty close. Definately worth the price I would say. The plates float good, there is one tiny little spot that snags my hair sometimes though."
26513,2,Can't really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout. It is annoying and wasteful to dump more than is necessary for one facial application into one's hand. Can you have the manufacturer replace this vial ? It's a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.
187893,2,Read alot about these curlers and they didn't deliver the goods...had to send them back...also the steaming unit and the curlers were delivered from two different vendors making return difficult
132364,2,"I've been using La Mer for 3 years now and always purchased it from Bloomingdales. I saw it on Amazon for a great price and decided to get the bigger jar and purchase it. I received it today and not only did it not come in the original box, the smell of this cream is not LA MER! All my jars of La Mer smelled exactely the same and this jar smells of heavy perfume. It is fake! Do not buy from them!"

36933,0,"So I bought this on Tuesday. It had great shipping got here in 3 days and I used the free shipping. I was hoping it was going to be as good as a different conair one that I used that has a steam dish in it.. it's not. So I will have to buy that one later on tooPros: Does add really great shine, locks in the moisture of your hair, takes half the time than my Amika straightener, price, and shippingCons: It tugs a lot on dry thick hair, it's a little bulky, has a weird smell, had some odd sticky stuff on it when I pulled it out of the packageAll in all, I spend 20 bucks on it plus shipping... I figure I'll just use it when I have wet hair, and I should be okay. Will be buying a different straightener in a few months though, cause this one won't work for my wedding. Still a great buy if you have thin or average hair."
70316,2,"I'll admit that I have only been using this shampoo for about 1 month. All the reviews that I read online about this product from various websites were negative but a new dematologist that I met with suggested that i try it since finasteride alone wasn't working. So far, this shampoo has done nothing for me but give me really flat, almost sticky hair. It's supposed to be conditioning shampoo but they definitely left the conditioner out! I am still losing the same amount of hairs everyday and still have the same amount of scalp itch. It has a medicine smell which doesn't really bother me but many people have been complaining about it. My suggestion, save your money!"

I am returning it and trying again to get pure peppermint not hemp-peppermint (which has a notable ""hemp"" smell to it...) soap. Amazon and Dr. Bronner soap are both great companies, just an item mix-up. Good luck and good soap!"
113877,2,"I bought this hair dryer about 18 months ago and within a year's time, the hair dryer started to give intermittent heat, which is very frustrating. It would emit heat and then switch automatically to cool hair while I just waited to switch back, very poor quality and very disappointing. On top of that, the diffuser attachment would not stay on! Farouk will not stand behind their product if you bought it anywhere on the internet, which is unfortunate because it's still their product and should have some means of satifying customers. Most of the reviews for this hair dryer are consistent to this and maybe one or two get lucky and don't have problems, but if you're spending $100 on a hair dryer, you don't rely on luck! This product just doesn't deliver! I would not recommend this product, it is not reliable, poor quality and not worth it. Try the T3 Featherweight or the T3 Evolution, they are more costly, but if you are serious about your hair dryers and want something that will last, try one of the T3's, but do NOT buy the CHI Farouk products.Chicago, IL"

My hair stayed curly until I washed it, and it made my hair really soft - not damaging at all.Well, I wore out the rollers years ago and threw it out. I wanted to curl my hair for Halloween, so I looked to see if they still made this system. Yay! I bought one and curled my hair. It stayed curly for about an hour. I don't know what's different about the new systems except that you no longer have to add salt to the water reservoir. Was it the salt that made the curl last? No idea..."
200244,0,"I have used several colored hair sprays and this one is middle of the pack. It sprays out well and covers well. The color matches good. However, it rubs off easily. Basically you can't touch your head after you've sprayed it on. This is the case just minutes afterwards, or hours. Streaks N Tips rubs off easily too. Graftobian and Adair won't rub off."
242271,2,"I bought this product in store, thinking it was a cream conditioner I had used many moons ago. Little did I realize that it's essentially Vaseline and it won't wash out!!! Now my hair looks like an oil slick, and 6 shampoos later, my hair still looks like I was involved in a head-on collision with an oil tanker. Now I'm stuck googling ""how to remove vaseline from hair"".... be warned!!!!"
151228,2,"When I bought this product, I was looking for the oil from the actual sagebrush plant. As this is not what I got, I was disappointed but my own fault for expecting the name of the product to BE what I wanted. It does smell ok, but not at all like the real stuff."
42894,2,"I ordered from Amazon LLC after reading negative reviews from third party sellers.For starters, the package had clearly been opened and resealed.The cologne reeks of rubbing alcohol, with absolutely NO other scents.Don't make the mistake I did, spend the extra $ and go to a dept store!!! Unless of course you're in the market for a $60 bottle of rubbing alcohol."

49207,0,"I bought this two years ago to use as a hydrating agent for my skin. However, every time I spray it on my face, some of it tends to get to my eye and it really sting the eyes. Even if your eyes are close you'll still feel the stinging sensation. It is very uncomfortable especially when you want to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. I haven't even finished the bottle yet because I hate the stinging sensation. Instead, I switched to the MAC hydrating spray and theirs doesn't sting. It actually feels alot better than Kinerase."
30451,2,"I was very excited about trying this product after reading many reviews. When I first put it on, it was light and not greasy. Approx 2 hours after putting it on I began to have a burning sensation on my face and turned red. My guess is my face does not agree with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy's in the product. So I am less than satisfied with this expensive purchase that will go to waste in my drawer. Maybe I will give it to one of the ladies at work.So my final thoughts are that this product could have a place with many people but not with me. Make sure you check to see if this product will be compatible with your skin before you buy, especially since it is so expensive."
232817,2,"If you want a natural nail tint, that looks like color of the real nail bed, this is the shade for you. It is not as pink as the photo; it's more cream. Really sheer, just perfect for a french manicure. Not for me though, I like my colors more saturated, even with a Fnch.ManiFollow up April 30, 2011: I went to the local salon, and found this shade, and guess what? this shade is not sheer. It is semi opaque. A few coats will give solid coverage. And the color is a creamy soft pink; not like the one I purchased on Amazon. Don't know what is up with the distributor; not the seller. Very disapointed, 'cause I have had to return 3 nail lacquers thus far; and without return shipping reimbursement.Update: The seller did reimburse one way shipping charges."

56466,2,"This gel looked really shiny and pretty upon application. My daughter had a few dry flakes where gel had been applied. I don't use a lot of gel on her natural curly hair, but sparingly with water, shea butter, curly cream.And when she went swimming, OMG. It looked white and gooey where the water hit the gel. I could really see the product build up.I let the gel air dry without a lid, it turned into a white sticky goo. It no longer looked like Clear Ice.A good wash with Infusium 23 took the goo out. Will definitely not use again. It's a wrap."
211289,2,Think twice before purchasing this product. At some point the metal top is going to start leaking which happened to me. It is a decent smelling cologne though.
162221,0,"I bought this because I thought I needed a heavier night cream, but its a little too heavy for my face as I have oily/combination skin. If you are dry/combination or dry and need that extra moisture, this would be an excellent product for you. I use it on my neck only and it works wonders for that, but when I use it on my face, I have a few whiteheads in the morning. Still a good product as most of the Olay line has proven to be."
28091,2,I'm not sure I noticed anything different with my curls but the smell of the product is hard to take. Would not order again. Am now going to try Tresseme Flawless curls based on price and Amazon reviews.
57280,0,"I ordered this product from Amazon ~3 months ago, when I was 5ms pregnant, after I got my first stretch marks on my chest. I did leave a review shortly after saying something like 'so far so good'. Well, here is my update. I am now 37.5 wks pregnant and this last weekend I got stretch marks all over my belly. My skin itches and hurts, but of course it is the look that upsets me the most.So... when reading the reviews be sure to pay attention to those ppl who are in the final stages of their pregnancy, b/c this is when most of the stretch marks tend to appear. I have used the product for 3ms, twice a day, no skipping. It smells fine and it is greasy like every other belly butter that I came across (although all of them claim to be non-greasy). But all of this does not matter if it doesn't work. So I guess you can buy and use it - it won't hurt you. But it may not help as well.To those who are interested, I am 5ft7"", started out 115lb, and 150 now.. so yes, I did gain 35lb and like they say it is 'all belly'. I eat very healthy and exercised regularly until 7.5ms pregnant (still do - just not as regularly :)Anyways, good luck to everyone with this product. It did not work for me, but maybe it will be a better fit for your skin."

The fragrance just doesn't seem to last very long and it wears off quickly. This is not a bad product by any means and it may suit some quite nicely, but for me I like something with a little more umph."
216208,0,"Several reviewers found this towel to be very absorbent. I am sure much of the response depended on variables such as texture, length of hair etc. My hair is medium/short, fine but not thin. I also live in a semi-arid climate and like to let me hair air dry as much as possible after towel drying. I sadly did not find this product worked for me much better than my terry cloth towels."
145522,2,I have used it since it came out and I love it'll ordered it from here because of the great price. I wasted my money because I had to go out and buy it again at my usual place. The product I was sent had the same packaging and tube but I used it and it is very greasy and left a residue on my face. I would never order from here again.
245636,0,"This hand cream was okay. I like Neutrogena and use a lot of their products, yet it wasn't as good as I expected. It wasn't that different from other products I've tried. It had a smooth gel texture which I didn't like that much because it dried too quickly and I couldn't get it all over my hands fast enough, so I had to keep re-applying more until I got it all over my hands. It was a good product though; it made my hands smooth and it wasn't greasy."

180132,0,"As a turquoise fanatic and nail polish enthusiast, I had to purchase this.Pros:-Only two coats needed-Bright color-Dries insanely fastCons:-Appears to be flat, no shimmer /gloss to it and thus a top coat of clear is needed. Some girls choose to skip this step but you can't really do that with this one.-The turquoise ended up being a teel that leans very green. This wasn't what I was looking for at all.-Thin polish that chips easily, another reason to need a top coat of clear."

2952,0,"I'm a little disappointed because the formula has changed. It is now called lavender ""Luminosity"" night cream. It has a sticker that says ""NEW more sustainable"" on the box. I don't know if the product has become better or worse, because it's my first time buying it. I specifically bought this product due to its near 5 star reviews, so I'm sad that I don't get to try out the original product everyone was raving about. As for this new formula, the scent is mildly pleasing, and it moisturizes my skin well. Takes a while to sink in. Lavender might burn your skin a little at first. I wish the formula didn't change. It's unwise for any company to change a perfect product that's loved so much. Chances are high they will not make it better, but worse."

240322,0,"The sunscreen and bug protection are great for golfing in the coastal regions of the south where the sun is bright and the mosquitoes are big. Blue bottle scent is pleasant and doesn't have the typical banana/coconut sunblock scent. Great product (would normally get 5 stars), but this product has a childish blue tint that does not disappear as it claims. It stains your hands and any clothing it contacts (this part of the product would get 0 stars). Recommend trying the white bottle product, same protection, but no blue dye."
11853,2,"I have used it before when i bought from the store.

121119,2,"Okay, I am a bit of a ""bath aficianado"". I tried this product thinking it would save me money because it has ""about 15 crushed bath bombs"" in one jar. But WOW was it awful!! I used (literally!) half of the jar, and not only could I smell almost nothing unless I cupped my hand to raise the water right up to my nose, but there were no skin softening properties. AT ALL! I would have done better to just dump half a box of baking soda in the tub!Now, I usually wouldn't leave a review...but after using this product, I'm thinking maybe that was always because even if I hated something I tried, I still liked SOMETHING about it AT LEAST a little bit. DO NOT waste your money here!! I won't name drop here, because I don't want to dilute the validity of my review, but there is a certain company who makes fresh handmade bath products in Canada that you should definitely try if you want a yummy bath. DON'T expect anything wonderful from Blockhead bath."

109708,1,"Ordered this product through the Amazon ""link"" to seller process. The seller provided accurate information regarding receipt of my order, expected shipping date and costs and the delivery method. No problems were experienced with its delivery. The product came as specified at the excellent sale price and this has been a successful experience as the product received was exactly as expected. Enjoy!!!"
208191,0,"First off, the company on Amazon shipped the brush quickly, and it was packaged in bubble wrap, so the company gets 5 stars. But the brush itself, I thought was just ok. It's a brush, and a bit overpriced for what it is. My daughter complained that the bristles were sharp and hurt her scalp."
192688,1,Amplify liquid gel is very hard to find. I was so glad to locate it on Amazon for a real decent price. I always check AMAZON first...........
158053,1,It has been very dificult to find a decent sized bottle of Liz Claiborne Parfum. Service was quick and I received exactly what I wanted.
70555,1,"I have been using Loreal Excellence along with an additive for resistant gray. My hair always faded during the month. I am using medium brown. I bought this just to try and it is the best tint ever. It was a little too dark first day, but after one washing it was perfect and has remained that way for six weeks. I had to touch up the roots after a month, but the remainder of the hair was perfect. This is a great product, gray or not especially if you have a fading problem."
204769,1,"Calyx has been the choice of many since first introduced by Prescriptives in 1986. It's a fresh invigorating fragrance with top notes of grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, papaya and guava. Blend these with touches of freesia, lily and marigold for a scent that envelopes the wearer warmly while radiating the energetic bouquet of a garden in bloom.It's a renewing scent for warm weather and comforting in the winter months as a reminder of the spring to come. Calyx knows no boundaries as it is appropriate for a girl's first perfume and enjoyed by women of all ages.Calyx is also available in bath and shower gel and a body lotion rich in coconut oil and Vitamin E."
7474,0,"If this fragrance were in an EDP, then I probably would have given it a 5 start rating. But, the EDT was too faint in fragrance even as soon as a couple of minutes after applying. Although the notes are wonderful, it was too weak to suit me. Casmir has much better sillage. I wish MiraBai had been stronger and I would have loved it."
234640,2,"I have used this product for 6 years. I always buy it from the spa but I saw that amazon sold it for much less. When it arrived, I noticed the plastic seal on it was different but didn't think much of it. I smelled the cream and it smelled the same. After a few day of use my skin seemed drier than normal. I had a very small amount left in the jar I had bought from the spa, when I did a side by side comparison I noticed the scent wasn't exactly the same and the consistency was different as well."
207696,1,I will buy this product again for sure! This is the great patchouli scent I love and the lotion is not sticky or greasy on the skin. I have received compliments every time I have used the lotion on the great scent! Item is a little pricey with the shipping but worth every penny!
221672,2,"Bought this for my wife and thought the fragrance that lasts only 30 minutes was normal, until she bought one from a department store. The store bought fragrance lasted for hours and hours.My experience with this product bought from Amazon does not reflect the usual high quality of its products. I do not recommend this product at all."
84931,1,"I was skeptical at first. The only way I found out about this product was at Rite-Aid with 1 bottle of the Body spray. It seemed to be working ok, and I did a search on Amazon.com for it, and seen all the great reviews. So for $10, I was like why not? Man am I glad I did. Amazing stuff, I noticed a difference after 2 or 3 days, then 1 week was even better, 2 weeks was more and going a month strong, almost completely clear, if I do get any breakouts, gone in a day almost. Strongly recommended for anybody who has gone to a Dermatoligist for years (i'm 28, been going since I was 13). Tried Retina, tretinoin, differin, all topicals, oral prescripts. Proactiv and others over the counter. I use Neutrogena Adavanced Solutions facewash and spf15 lotion, the acne lotion worked, but not as good as natures cure lotion.(almost the same, but natures cure has twice the benzoyl peroxide and additional aloe for cooling) with Natures Cure 2 step process. I'm sold.Thanks!"
130372,2,"Box was damaged and when I opened it, there was no product in the box only paper filler. I would like a refund or another shipment ASAP."
1043,0,"I was so excited to get this product. I have wavy/curly hair just below my shoulders. My hair is thicker than most. The product works, but took FOREVER. You have to take really small sections, and go over each section a few times. By the time I was done I was soaked with sweat! I think it would work much better for shorter hair. I'm back to my round brush and flat iron."
218119,1,"I first bought this shampoo at a beauty shop because I love how it smells. Buying it by the gallon is VERY MUCH less expensive. It seems to work as well as any other shampoo or soap for cleaning your hair. Being a man, I have no idea how it works with conditioners and whatever else the ladies may use with it. It does leave my hair with a nice fragrence, which I am very pleased with."
9321,0,I bought this fragrance to test it. It was a little to heavy for my tastes. However it did last all day... it just wasnt for me.
126686,1,"This perfume was a gift for my mother, she says that it is a nice perfume, she loved it and apparently everyone asks what perfume is she wearing.So if you like the fragances by Hugo Boss, you'll probably would like this one."
154453,1,"This is the best tool you can have to help give flawless makeup application. This is not like the regular makeup sponges you can buy in stores. Its teardrop design gives a seamless application, and the smaller tip can be used in the delicate eye area and to conceal blemishes and dark spots (if I had any, that is...lol) I have used brushes to apply foundation, and there are some that work really well, but nothing holds a candle to the BeautyBlender. The key is to use it wet, although I will admit that on days when I am running behind I have used it dry and it still works great. Using it wet really helps sheer out my foundation, giving it a ""second skin"" appearance. The sponge is nice sized, and very durable. The one I am using currently is going on it's sixth month of use; with daily foundation application. It never flakes off, or begins to fall apart like cheap drugstore brand sponges. The one drawback is that it will get stained from products (especially Revlon Color Stay foundations), so it appears to be dirty even when it is freshly washed. That is the only drawback I can think of. I know the price can turn some people away, but I assure you, it is worth every penny. You get two sponges and that will last me almost a year.I forgot to mention...this product is latex free, which is great for me and it also works well with mineral makeup. Use it the same way you would for liquid foundation; wet it, pat it in the makeup and stipple it. Works really well!"
28325,0,"I'm sure this is a good hair dryer for most people, but my hair is very fine and flyaway wispy, so I am personally unhappy with it . Even the low setting is way too high for my hair. If you have fine hair, I would recommend looking for a hair dryer with a high, medium and low. The medium setting seems to necessitate a lower low speed."
79300,1,"I don't usually like to wear a scent that's noticiable, but this Calvin Klein is very good for special occacations."
238397,0,"Unfortunately, as I suspected, the description of this product- Natural Brown #58 - is a misnomer. In English, no such creature; #58 is Black- Brown which I assume to be rather dark and did not want to order. But, what the heck, eventually it washes out. Haven't used it yet but we'll see how it does. To lessen confusion, I suggest Amazon eliminate this name."
58727,2,"Terrific! Another overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product from the folks who brought us the other overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product known as Stri-Vectin.Give me a break!Save your dough, folks!"
225471,0,Great product for as long as it lasted. part that holds brushes in place broke after only l month use
247272,0,"The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color"
194656,2,It has zero shine and takes at least 3 coats to look OK. Then you would need a top coat. I threw mine away.
145203,0,also read about this in a magazine and online..read reviews listed...seems the gel weights down my hair...maybe it provides some volume but the weighting down does not make up for the volume to me..would not buy again.
99892,0,"My hair was nice and shiny for the first few days after I used this product. I've noticed that a lot of color washes out when you wash your hair, so it fades quickly. The odor was average for this type of product. I'm not sure I'd use this one again."
210057,2,Items was old and stale smelling. Paid a lot of money for some stale/old perfume and had no one to contact about the issue
80707,0,"I bought this because it doesn't have the dreaded dimethicone or amodimethicone, because the 'cone family is truly the bane of all curly-haired existence (Read ""Curly Girl"" by Lorraine Massey for more on that), and because it ""has stood the test of time.""Still and all, from my standpoint as curly and proud of it, this is not an impressive conditioner, esp. for a premium-priced product. It DOES condition, but not better than most things out there. I love my curls, and I'm not too hung up about (a bit of) frizz. On the up side, Humectress is a decent conditioner with good ingredients and the pump bottle is a neat and easy way to dispense product. On the down side, I wish I would have spent my $30+ on 5 or 6 smaller bottles of my current favorite, L'Oreal Vive Pro Nutri-Gloss Conditioner for hair that is long and curly/wavy (in pink bottle)."
241458,0,"It doesn't have a temperature setting, that's what flash heating or whatever means. It is ok. I used to have a bomb-ass one that was a generic that I liked more, but since I don't live where I used to, I don't have access to it."
28420,2,"I have used Canus, but was very disappointed that it contained mostly sulfates and preservatives. Now, I use nothing but products made by Wendylou's Natural Bath. Homemade vegetable based bath and body products which my whole family uses and loves."
246454,0,"I purchased this product primarily to find a drug store brand mascara that is as easy to remove as Clinique's Curling mascara or Christian Diorshow. While the advertisement touted easy removal, it was much harder to remove than the Clinique or Diorshow. Disappointed."
109320,1,"This is just a pleasant, non overbearing, light and clean scent. I wouldn't recommend this cologne for teens- for this requires one to be a bit of a connoisseur..."
225473,2,This product stopped working after I used it 4 times. The iron got too hot and overheated. Before it overheated it did work well.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
226967,0,"It worked okay the first couple of times but the blade became dull very quickly, I had hoped and expected it to last longer."
249707,0,"I picked this color because I am working on going back to my natural color. This dark blonde turned out more of a light brown. Still not a bad color, just not what I was going for. Oh, and the color holds very well, it's been 3 weeks since I colored it and hardly any change!"
10761,0,I tried IntraCleanse and was hoping for great results. It might have just been that the product didn't work for me. but it cause really bad stomack pains.I would definately recommend reviewing all the ingredients before purchasing.
4561,0,"The clipper haircutting function ok, but 2 of the combs (left ear taper and blending) were broken, and the cleaning brush didn't came."
153915,0,"This was a very large-sized product. It would take a long time to go through so much of the cream. I have rosacea and my dermatologist suggests I only use two different products on my face. Cetaphil is one of them. It went on very smoothly and kept my face moist. When it's first put on it's almost too wet looking, as a little bit goes a very long way. It doesn't plug up pores or cause any skin irritation."
144061,0,"When my father had a wound they had this at the hospital. I thought, great!! this must work if a hospital uses it. I tried it for a long time on my old scars. I didn't see any changes. If you massage a scar it will help break up scar tissue & I think the only thing that did any good using this was massaging my scar a couple times a day. I didn't see any miracle happening. For the money i want something that does something besides bringing my hopes up for nothing."
170872,0,"I picked this because of the color. And, the color is true. And unlike other China Glaze, the product was quite thin, spread unevenly with the brush in the cap (although with a detail brush it came out o.k.), and required several coats for good coverage. Oh, and it's not glossy, it's a flat finish."
169270,0,I feel like this product is working but it takes a while. I use it with my micro needle roller.
106277,0,"While the color is not quite a true black, this cake eyeliner is easier to use than the gel products"
22914,0,"Unfortunately both pumps arrived broken (smashed). Fortunately, I still had old ones of the same product and could swap them out."
128042,0,"I could see this product working very well on coarse or kinky hair. My curls, though nicely defined, were completely weighed down, and I didn't even use that much. Also, I prefer to let my hair air dry, and with this stuff, you need to blow dry or your hair will be stiff. And unfortunately, heavy products double hair-drying time for me. I'll stick to mousse--faster drying and more volume for fine hair."
154374,0,I used this all summer as we traveled through Europe... this towel is too small! I bought the large and it is WAY too small.
124874,2,"My hair is oily, and sometimes I have acne on my scalp. I thought the tea tree and mint is nice for me, but it makes my scalp more and more itch...so I have to throw it..."
73575,0,"This product is okay. I feel like my hair needs to be damp, not totally wet, to spray on and then continually scrunch and play with so it doesn't weigh down my hair."
232331,0,"This was my first foray into hot rollers and not knowing how well they would work for my hair type, I didn't want to spend a lot on a set. This set fit the bill nicely.Pros:Heat up quicklyCase is compact, keeps all the pieces together for both use and storage and is easy to put awayTwo sizes in rollers, so I could see what fits best in my hairGives my hair body that lasts all day- nearly impossible to do otherwise!Price- if the set hadn't done what I wanted it to do, I wouldn't be out muchQuick shipping with PrimeCons:No auto shut-off feature, which makes it a bit of a safety hazardNot always easy to get hair to get on to rollers without kinking (I have fine hair with layers, so it's a struggle to get the longer and shorter pieces to all stay secured)Pins aren't very effect at securing rollers- I'll have them rolled up against my scalp but they'll slip down a couple inches once I ""secure"" themRollers themselves are a bit heavy and prone to pull at hair if not put in just rightBeing new to hot rollers, I'm not sure if my issues with getting rollers in place and securing them are going to be common to any set or not. All in all, I found the hassles to be worthwhite as I'm able to give my hair the kind of waves that have never before been possible- other methods always fall out within the hour!All in all, I'm happy with this set. At some point, I may upgrade now that I know that the concept of hot rollers works with my hair but for now, I find the pros outweigh the cons and I like the new styling options they give me."
188649,2,I've been a user of this stuff for years. This batch barely generates any suds and leaves my hair like it's been covered in wax.
30096,2,"Product feels cool upon application, yet there is a lingering and annoying stickiness. I could overlook this if I thought Derma e's Pycnogenol Gel was an excellent product, even mediocre, but no. The bottom line is this, there must be more research done into Pycnogenol before you claim it was the next natural beauty revival product. Maybe it was just my experience but this ingredient did my skin no favors, I ended up with discolorations, dead and dull looking skin. Kinda how the tree probably looks that this ingredient was extracted from. I am a man so I kinda liked the idea of using tree bark extract to make my skin look better but it just doesn't work out well. Please scrap this whole product line Derma e. Everything else is excellent though."
208565,0,"This hair dryer stand came in record time even with my Prime shipping. I ordered it at about 1am and received it by 12:50pm the same day. That is the good part. Now, for the product itself. It is not quite as bad as some of the other reviews have stated. Yes, it probably won't support heavy blow dryers. My dryer is a BaByliss BABTT5585 Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer with a shipping weight of only 4 pounds. I put it in the clamp which seems plenty strong, then attached the included Velcro strap to make it very securely attached to the stand. The instructions are a little lacking, as a previous reviewer stated. The inner tube seems to need to come out the end that it is closest to, WRONG, it is the other end. Once I had that correct, I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to tighten. I kept trying to tighten it by twisting it to the right. Apparently, in China where it is made, to tighten things you must turn it left NOT right! So the height adjustment does in fact work. Now on to the tiny screws. I think this could definitely use much improvement. It comes with 2 tiny little screws. Several people mentioned they received no screws. Well, I almost missed mine because they were in a little bag, inside in the bottom of the package that contained the instructions. They did fit the holes in both the bottom and the bracket. It just seems still a little wobbly on the main pole. I think a little fix will be required or it will just keep getting looser until the only screw is just stripped, which it practically is right now. It can not tighten any more and it still has a wiggle to it. Since there are really no alternative on Amazon to purchase, I will just fix this one to make it stronger. If you don't have a handy husband with a drill and stuff to make threads for the extra screws this is going to need, better get the small tabletop one. The base does seem weighted enough to prevent falling over. The instructions do state not to bend the goose neck over 90 degrees to prevent it falling over, which makes sense, probably even more so with heavier dryers. Overall, it is not horrible considering the price. It won't cost much, if anything, to fix the obvious problem with it. Make no mistake, it can be used just as it is, however, I do have experience with poles that do not tighten perfectly and over time they just get worse with tilt, falling over and of course, WIGGLE. This being something that will be moved around repeatedly, I feel will be at risk of that wiggle problem requiring the fix sooner rather than later."
3603,2,"I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return it for a refund. DermaDoctor needs to go back to med school! Try Dr. Brandt's Pore minimizer instead."
192757,0,"This is light floral scent, quite pleasant but if you don't like smelling like a bar of soap you might want to pass this up.If you are looking for sensual or rich scent this is not it. Personally, I sort of like it but I don't think its worth the price."
30772,0,don't over do it. this perfume can be quite overwhelming if not used in moderation. this would be best for a fun evening out.
114743,0,This works quite well but I wish that it came in LIGHT blonde. I would call this light not blonde.
182258,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
104981,0,"I used to love this a few years back.Something has changed.It is now a lot more ""used oil"" smelling and less of the bright and peaceful type of smells that are good about it.I fear for the people around me when I wear it, so I really have to go easy on it.Shipping was quick through Prime.Price is okay.Packaging was substandard."
167098,1,"I like the light texture of this daily lotion and the green tint helps ""cool"" down any redness going on. It also has sunscreen in it so an added bonus. It can also be used under makeup too."
227783,0,"I bought this shampoo as part of an Ouidad kit. I have fine curly hair that knots easily, but tends to be dry. As a result, I only wash my hair a couple time per week, though I use conditioner way more often.This is probably one of the better shampoos that I have used for curly hair. It really doesn't create as much suds and my hair did not feel as dry or get oily more quickly. So as far as the essential part of the product goes, it works for me.The scent, however, is AWEFUL. It is the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used. I think it smells like sandlewood. I realize some people like that smell, but to me it STINKS. And it doesn't go away. I washed my hair with the shampoo two days ago and I can STILL SMELL IT.If you don't mind paying for it (it's not cheap) and you like sandlewood or have damaged olfactory senses, this isn't a bad shampoo for curly hair. If you are smell sensitive, don't waste your money."
242152,1,"This conditioner worked really well. I have very long, thick, wavy hair, and Neutrogena made it much easier to comb through without breakage. I didn't need to use a lot to get the desired results and actually got several positive comments on my hair during the week. It gave my hair a nice shine but didn't leave my hair heavy or greasy feeling. The scent was great, not overly 'perfumey.'"
88877,0,"This perfume smelled great on my boss,a nd other people I know, but didn't work as well on me. I do have a hard time finding scents that are compatible with my body chemistry, but if your someone that can wear a large variety of scents, then go for it!!!"
50160,0,"I shave my head myself, and use this mirror to see the back of my head. It works, but it's cheap. It fogs up and it gets really dirty. I have to clean it a lot. Otherwise, it is the right shape, size, and price. Gets the job done."
110946,1,"After the first night of using this product, I saw an obvious reduction in my pimple. The pimple was not gone completely, but it was definitley smaller and less visible. Although product says it's a gel, it's more of a white, pastey cream. The main con is that I paid $6.00 for the product on Amazon, and I have since seen the same product in the local dollar store for half the price."
226114,1,"I bought this in Beige - comes in a very cool Dior blue/gold lipstick case, so I feel pretty fancy everytime I pull this out of my purse to apply. This is a lipstick so any gloss will be shinier any day - this stuff feels thicker & heavier too and has a strong cosmetic taste, like Grandma's lipstick or something. It's sheer and has a hint of glitter/sparkles but I noticed the color eventually settles into liplines/creases - which then you have to dab (and lose the shininess!). I'm more of a lightweight, yummy-flavored type sheer lipgloss fan, so this isn't usually my first pick for lips when I'm fumbling thru my purse. I still love Dior."
183730,0,"The hairdryer is better than my last, but still takes awhile to dry. The reviews were right in explaining that it is pretty heavy. Not bad, but not thrilled."
68499,0,"Small black eye patches are difficult to find. Wish the item would have been higher quality. Purchased these before, they wear out quickly."
174228,0,"The towel is fine, it doesn't take up as much space as a regular towel so it's good for travel.The pink color became very dull and faded after only one washing. I'm a bit disappointed aboutthe nasty looking color however the towel absorbs moisture very well. I think the white onewould have been a better option."
18603,0,"It is a little strong initially, maybe even overpowering at first, but then it mellows, and has a nice forest/woods feel, not citrusy, that is nice. However, when I go to the fragrance counter at stores and sample a ton of fragrances, I have to admit that I don't really find Ralph Lauren fragrances appeal to me personally.I got this as a gift, and probably would not have bought this one myself. Its lasts a long time, and can seem pleasant enough. Its 'ok', not something I'd heartily recommend."
237096,0,"This product is indeed a watered down version of the soap. Still good soap but 1/5 as potent as same bought a year or so ago. Again, good soap, BUT why don't they mention less potent?"
178089,0,It definately makes me aware that I am biting my nails but I would prefer something stronger tasting to really deter me.
56534,0,"I didn't really see any difference, plus it stings when you put it on. The stings goes away after a few minutes, but I don't know if it's normal that it supposed to stings? High prices for something that doesn't seem show quick results. Wouldn't recommend this. Not worth the money."
52230,2,"Thickening spray was my favorite of ALL my beauty products but now it is a waste of money. It was worth the high price before but not any more. It does not give the volume it did before and leaves my hair baby soft, as in limp and not full. I need to find a new thickening product. Very disappointing."
18811,0,"Originally - I ordered four 18 oz bottles of the Aveeno Stress Relief Body Wash at what was a great price. I received four bottles of 12 oz product.When I brought that to their attention, they offered to refund the prorated amount or send two more 12 oz bottles of product. I chose the latter.What arrived was two more bottles - but of a different type of Aveeno Body wash. They then offered to give me a rebate if I kept those bottles - which I accepted, since I was tired of the runaround.Now the ad shows the bottles to be 12 oz? I wonder............."
98695,2,"I ordered this product hoping it was the same as the product I was using. The picture that was shown was the exact product that I had at home but when the order arrived it was the ""new, improved"" product with completely different ingredients. This new product does not work as well as the old one. If they would have changed the picture from the purple bottle to the cream colored one, then I would have known that the product had changed. Even the name is different.Since ordering the above hair product I have tried ""Bouncy Cream"" by Iso. It is a wonderful product and so much better than this one from Silky, Sexy Hair."
204027,1,"This not only makes my skin feel soft, If I put it on my legs after shaving they shine! Highly recommend this product."
6716,0,"I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for this. I went back to my old Wally World cheapie. It didn't dry my thick hair any faster nor did it make it smoother. Seems like any other hair dryer to me and actually it dried slower for me. Go figure. I g ave it 3 stars because it did work, just not all super dooper like I had hoped."
55790,0,"Send it as a gift to my favorite. He reported back with a little sarcasm as to the quality. I retorted with: What do you expect for $6.98? He called me a chipi, chipi, but I was not fazed for I knew that my intentions for sending him this gift was for him to use in his vehicle every time he smoked ""ganja"", not for wearing at the local discotheque or at the Ritz Carlton. In the end he conceded that this does marvels concealing the pungent smell of expensive herbs and I felt re-vindicated and after all it does make for a great car fragrance or for a cheap date (hot dogs and bargain matinees). I thought the price was fantastic and did admire the container for it looked like it was harboring a cuban cigar more than a Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces. From many respected reviewers in amazon.com I keep reading that most of the more expensive name brands are kind of water down as compared to department stores purchases (such as Macy's, Dillard's, Nordstrom, etc.) so this info has left me a little insecure as to being able to obtain the legitimate article specially when the price appears to be very inexpensive. I have not used nor smelled this brand so I wouldn't be able to attest as to quality and satisfaction of ownership but for the money involved I knew the smell inside his car would, hopefully, one day assist in the arduous task of camouflaging any indiscreet consumption of volatile fumes that can and will get you in dire straits faster than you can say: ""I didn't do it"". 3 Stars and seriously, no disrespect intended for the admirers of this brand of cologne."
62185,0,"I have not had more of the worse side effects people have voiced in their reviews- the burning sensation for example- but I was shocked when a few weeks after my regular use of the deodorant, I saw the skin on my armpits peel! I didn't shave there much during the winter, but it became really obvious once I shaved my armpits and applying the deodorant regularly that the skin was peeling. I have a hunch that the men who use this product may not have this as an issue as much as women do (at least, those who shave their armpits), since men probably have more hair blocking direct contact with the deodorant onto their skin. I find the skin peeling issue somewhat ironic because the media has recently talked about how advertising companies are trying to make women feel bad about how their armpits look. Toms, you need to make a better formula so you won't have that problem!I used the Apricot scent, and it smells pretty wonderful- this is going to sound odd, but it's like my armpits smelled like jam! Ha! I have to remind myself to wear/reapply this deodorant because otherwise, I REALLY reek. This might be due to my body finally rid of the perspiration blockers from my previous antiperspirant. I just had no idea I could smell this good AND this bad.All in all, I didn't have as bad problems as other reviewers, but I can't exactly rave about it either. This is my first foray into non-aluminum products, so I may edit my review as I test other products out. 3/5 stars- not too bad/not that great."
226381,0,"The smell for me is okay, I think I just got what I paid for, it's strong and aggressive, should know this point."
47297,0,This product smells great. But I haven't noticed any significant change.Been using evey night 4-6 weeks.
84970,2,"It's nice to see that others have had success with Nature's Cure tablets. I took the pills each day...morning and night...and it was if I had never taken it. I had zero improvement. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the product is fairly priced, it didn't make my acne worse, and when you have acne it is worth it to try out. I have had total success since with both Proactiv and University Medical's product Acne Free. Good luck!"
246320,2,The photo shows WetNap brand. That is not what was shipped so I had to return it. False advertising!
183292,0,"Love the color, unfortunately the polish has no shine. You have to apply a top coat, which never works too well for me."
208067,0,"This is a good product. Having severe allergies to most hair products I was pleased that Le Remouver worked for me, that is before the shampoo became almost nothing but goo. It is so thick with grease that it does not work as well as the previous formula that was in a brownish-mauve bottle and was thinner. The old product cut through oil, hair spray, and polution. The new product, not so much.I do not need conditioners and would appreciate Mastey offering a choiceof the conditioning product and the oldie but goodie shampoo."
141237,1,The price was excellent and the fit and quality are more then expected. I would definately say this is one of my best purchases
187924,1,"This curling iron is perfect for creating big, soft waves on my shoulder length hair. You can adjust the heat settings and get it pretty hot if you have harder to curl hair. I really like how it smoothes out the frizzies as it curls, so my hair is wavy and smooth. Because the barrel is so big, the curls aren't tight at all and I like that for a more casual look. I'm really happy because it gives me nice hair without looking overly ""fixed."""
241224,0,"This is the first time that I have bought false eyelashes, they are ok. obviously you get what u pay for. The eyelashes were not cut properly I had to cut and make even."
232382,0,"These did not meet my wife's expectations but they may well be more a result of her lofty expectations rather than the quality of the product. For that reason, I rated an average 3-stars."
17703,1,"This is a great product to enhanse and define curls. It's work perfectly with very curly hair without any stifness. The only reason i don't give it five stars is because if you have long hair and want to define your curls but hav some volume as well, this mousse as a tendancy to reduce the volume of very long hair. So great for curls, but without volumizing effect. The price too is kind of expensive. This product is cheaper in france: around 18-24 Euros. It is worth the price though and Kerastase products are seen as the best in Europe."
133522,0,"I have male pattern frontal/crown boldness. I bought this product about 2 months ago. I did not make a before and after pic but I noticed somewhat of an improvement on the security camera of the convenient store I frequent. Here is my experience. After the first couple of uses I use to feel somewhat itchy and burning sensation, but that eventually went away. Initially I lost some hairs in the process, but i believe I got them back. I have thin tired hair, and this formula tend to even dry it more. Another side effect I noticed is that when I put the product in just before bedtime my eyes tend to burn (not always), and I tend to have trouble falling asleep. So take it at least a couple of hours before bedtime. Has it regrew hair or will it work on the long run, I dont know but what I am sure of is that I use to be able to put my hand in my hair, rub it and I will see some hair in my hands, that does not happen anymore so I think I am not loosing as much hair as I use to. I will probably keep using this product, but I regret not using this product a year sooner. It would have probably been an excellent preventive measure, but better late than never."
54307,2,I placed an $88.00 order with this company for Oscar by Oscar De La Renta...I reseve my order in the mail and much to my dis-may it was something by Oscar in a blue bottle that smelled like oranges and said limited addtion on the bottle. I bought this for my grandmother because this is all that she has wore for 30years...so I wrote the company they said I had to pay the cost to send it back!!! To spend that kinda money and be treated this way its just not worth my time so I have let my friends and family know what has happen I have forwarded them the emails from this company and I can safely say that they nor myself will ever order from this company ever ever again! They do not want to take the chance on being scammed so that is why im writting this so this way nobody else can be scammed either.
15275,1,"This scent is great! Very clean and light, citrus-y and fresh smelling. I've been wearing it for years and every woman that smells it on me has that ""wow what is that?"" reaction. I love it. Unfortunately, it's hard to find these days. This price is fantastic!! I bought 3 of them and it's the real thing. All came sealed in retail boxes. I purchased from the famous auction site once and got a fake one so it's nice to get the real thing for this price. I think I'll get another 3 in case they run out or discontinue."
2014,0,"thanks, i cannot find this in any stores and have been seeking this product. arrived on time, priced right, just what i wanted! i'll be ordering again from you."
235327,0,"I have sensitive skin and avoid harsh cleansers. So, when I found this product, I was excited. I love the scent and how light and gentle this creamy cleanser feels but it doesn't seem to clean the make-up off my face well. I have to wash at least couple of times to get totally clean."
116547,2,It works great when you first get it. That doesn't last long though because it will break on you. After just one month I was using it and blue sparks started flashing near the red light. It stopped and then the next day I used it again and white sparks started coming out of it. The room smelt like burnt plastic. This hair straightener is a piece of junk and I would not recommend wasting your money on it. You would probably be better off buying one from a salon.
101890,0,"I did feel some burn after applying the lotion, but no flaming rashes here thankfully. Nothing unusual, especially if you have used skin scrubs in the past. The smell was pretty neutral for all 3 components, which is a big plus for me. As to the success I had in using it to clear my acne? I have only mild, occasional acne, and it seemed to do the job within 3 days. Then again, would my blemishes have disappeared within 4? Probably.From what I saw from the other reviewers, I wouldn't expect any magical results if you have severe acne. But from my experience, the system's worth a try if other brands have failed you."
199126,2,"Product misidentifiedThe web page describes the product as Eau De Parfum Spray Deodorant but is actually, I'm very disappointed.Upon receipt of the package it back"
236296,0,"I had been eyeing this polish for a long time, but was always put off because of the price. So finally I just decided to get it. I really do love the color, and the uniqueness of this polish, I've never really seen anything like it. It is a little difficult to apply, and it takes about 3-4 coats for it to be completely opaque on the nails. I'd recommend wearing it over a black or dark blue polish instead. The lasting power is HORRIBLE, it was chipping pretty bad after only one day. For $20 I expected the lasting power to be at least as good as my other polishes, but it wasn't."
164389,1,"I have noticed, as my skin matures, that not only are fine lines more prevalent, but, my pores seem enlarged. I heard that clay masks were good for reducing that affect, in addition to pulling toxins out of your epidermal wall. Worth a try, right? I have been really pleased with Now Food products, thus far, and figured that their red clay mask would not fail to disappoint. I was right. You need one tablespoon of the clay, and about one teaspoon of warmish water. You mix it together, take a spoon or your hand and spread mixture on your face and neck.. Then, let the mask dry and harden on your face, for 15-20 minutes. I felt my skin drying out, slightly, but I figured that was part of the property of this mask's purifying properties. I was right. Once I rinsed it off, my pores looked smaller, the blemishes I had appeared less inflamed, and I felt cleansed. This is a great product I would definitely use again."
105257,2,"Not at all happy with this product. The only way the smell stays is if you spray it a bunch on your shirt, etc.. and then only that one spot gives off the scent (not like cologne/perfume where the scent carriers)."
65267,2,I bought this without smelling it first. What a mistake this stuff smells just plain awful.
63095,1,They originally sent me the wrong scent of lip gloss. I called and they said to keep that and they would also send me the correct flavor. It ended up being an even better deal for me!
142589,1,"I am happy with this product. You pay 3x this price for the same amount (or less!) of shea butter at most bath and body stores. This stuff works great, has a mild pleasant scent, and is a great price."
176559,1,I have been using Very Sexy cologne for a few years now. I like the clean understated scent. I have had many compliments.
135199,2,"I don't know if it's because I have longer hair, but it was hard to get it on my scalp without getting all over my roots and the rest of my hair. It left my hair waxy and sticky. Also, the product never seemed to dry and I would get it all over my hands any time I touched my hair/head."
46190,1,Received product quickly and safely. Will order products I can't find. Prefer this over driving all over city to find what I like.
99848,0,"I liked how easy this product was to use. However, I'm not sure about the color. I am now very blonde -- almost too blonde. I think I'd use this product again but I'd choose a different color."
52941,0,"The main reason why I still have this parfum is because the bottle is so pretty sitting up on my armoir. I'm not really a big fan of the parfum's scent. It's very bland, boring, and has no kick to it. It reminds me of the musk that my mother used to wear back in the 1980s. If you are a J-Lo fan, however, I would go with her Miami Glow."
249670,2,"The power button stopped working 2 days past the warranty date Junk. It was good while it lasted, but I feel robbed."
166340,0,"Not your top of the line, but still decent. hydrates well, but is a bit runny.Good for Beginners 30 and up!"
223301,1,"I love this product! I got a tiny tube from Ulta just to try it out, and I love it. Its not sticky or greasy at all. Leaves me with soft smooth curls! I use it over a leave in conditioner and its amazing. Dont need a whole lot either. Good stuff."
157848,2,"Let me just say that this cream, for all you potential purchasers out there, is a lather-less cream. It will not lather at all and goes on clear. It did seem to moisturize, but while shaving it offered no help to let the razor glide over my face. The razor actually had more drag with this product than when using even the cheapest of the canned shaving creams. It didn't cost much so I can't be truly upset about my purchase, but I will not be using it again. For a wonderful product in this price range, check out the Kiss My Face moisture shave products. They lather up very well and offer a very enjoyably smooth shave."
154781,2,I have an opinion about the product simply because it did not arrive at my house. And the deadline for the day was up 9 / 7.
177046,0,"Although this product is supposed to be la creme de la creme, as far as moisturizers are concerned, I felt it was lacking. Too heavy, sticky, and my skin didn't really feel moisturized, just overwhelmed. I will continue to use the product, though, as I would like to observe it's effect on my skin over the next few weeks."
89589,0,"It's not as light as I thought it would be, and it's quite loud. I have trouble hearing my clients while using the dryer. It's ok I don't love it, but it does what it needs to."
3315,0,"I have fragile, fine hair, and I was looking for something to stop the breakage. The good news is that this didn't cause any more breakage, but my hair remained in the same shape it was in before I started using it. It just maintained the status quo. I finished the bottle, but I won't buy more."
139593,1,They sell it for the retail price (minus tax) and shipped it the 1st or 2nd day after I placed the order.
175387,0,"I like this shower cap because it is terry-lined, but there is no band around it. It does not keep water out around my back neck area and I think the band would help. Also, it is rather a big cap that doesn't fit snug around my head. It looks rather cheaply made. A band around it would certainly improve the look and purpose of the shower cap."
36162,0,"This shampoo cleans nicely however it is very thin and I need to use a lot to get any sort of lather. Also it smells very strong of earth and herbs, and the scent stays with you."
89578,0,"Was not pleased with color. Hard to tell real color on screen. Oh well, I'll use them sometimes."
132722,0,"These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads but just not all of them. Ive tried it a few times and it still won't get everything out. Its says on the box only to use on your nose but I tried it on my forehead anyways and it worked fine. Just like my nose though it didn't get everything out."
169070,0,"The zinc oxide is only 20 percent in this, so it's not very effective for diaper rash. Desitin or store brands at the same percentage (40) is a much better purchase."
100853,1,"I have combination and sensitive skin. So I have a hard time finding gentle enough products that do a through job. I do use Aveeno and Oil of Olay, but this is my new favorite. Rinses off easily - with no harsh dry feeling. It smells great too!!!! I wish I could get this in my local drugstore. I can only find it here or at drugstore dot com:-("
175915,1,"I love Alba products, and this is no exception. The island citrus smells great--sweet but not too perfumey--and lathers up very nicely."
169716,1,"I love Sween Cream. My wife 1st came in contact with it years ago when she was a nurse. We tryed it and loved it. The only place we could find it was at the hospital and they quit carrying it. Over the years we have done without.I am now an Amazon customer and decided to see if they had it. Good news for me. I bought a couple of jars a year or so ago and was not disappointed.Recently I went through treatment for cancer. The side effects from chemo were to my face and neck. The Sween Cream really came in handy. It worked great to reduce the redness and rash. The radiation punched the intensity up a few levels. Again, the Sween Cream helped reduce the effects. It is not a cure all but sure beat the other half dozen products the nurses at the cancer clinic recommended. The nurses at the clinic could not believe how well my skin was doing.I used it so much we had to buy more. We bought a case to save per jar costs--retirees are on a fixed income you know. It is money well spent.I would recommend Sween Cream to anyone with dry and irritated skin. My wife and I love the stuff."
142460,1,"I absolutely love this product. If I wear no make-up, it evens out my skin tone beautifully! If I use it under make-up, it gives my skin amore youthful glow. I have not found another product that comes even close to this one. It delivers!"
101530,1,"opi has the best shatter, however the white is a pinch translucent where you can see the color under the white part a pinch. really cool though"
224882,0,This spinner art set was a pretty sight for me when I saw it on Amazon [...]I really liked it at first but then I figured out it was a BATH TOY! [...] This was still a good toy but I really didn't like the idea of the bath toy. I just wanted to alert you that this might not be the toy you are looking for. I'm sorry if you're dissapointed [...] Thanks for reading!
243112,0,"Gives great coverage. Eye Shadow does last all day. It takes practice to get the hang of applying. However, this product is a little too messy for my every day use. They are too many holes which allows for too much product in the container at one time. I will use this for occassions when I have ample time to apply correctly."
1276,0,product is a good idea but coloring doesn't quite match although I adjust color with an eyebrow pencil. The brow product does leave brows neater and sharper looking.
241120,2,I was not happy at all with this product. When I received it a large amount of the cologne leaked out of the bottle and coated the box. I did NOT receive the 3.4 ounces I paid for.Would not buy from again.
119767,0,"TheConair MDF2R Facial Sauna With Timeris a nice product for steaming your face. The size is large enough for most people with small to medium sized faces, though many will have to adjust their heads side to side to get even steaming all around. This is a product that will most likely be used more by women than men, and the face cup seems to be designed with that in mind.I purchased this as a gift for somebody. While they enjoyed it, it ended up being one of those items that gets infrequent use. I started using it after that. After doing some testing on it myself, I found that there were some good things about it and some that could be improved.PROS:+ Very fair list price and a good value for the mix of functions+ Seems to work relatively well, depending on your needs+ Nice compact size+ Simple controls are intuitive to figure out+ Decent amount of steam is produced quickly+ Timer feature and auto-shut-off will be a pluses for some+ Extra sinus attachment may be useful for some+ Both the normal steamer or sinus attachment help to relieve congestion+ 2 year warrantee is quite generous given the priceCONS:- The face brush doesn't produce enough friction to really perform deep cleaning- More heads on the brush would have also been nice- The unit little water, requiring most people to refill it to finish a session- Difficult to position yourself for comfort and full coverage- The edges of the bowl could have been better designed for comfortI am not sure if larger units that hold more water for steaming are sold here. This unit requires refills for a single session. That can be distracting when you are trying to use this alone. The face brush includes two small heads for cleaning and moisturizing, but doesn't seem extremely effective. Yet newer versions of the brush concept may not necessarily be better than a washcloth to gently clean away dead layers and dirt from your face.This item works, but there are alternatives. The jury is still out on similar tools, even those with wider cleaning heads like theNeutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad. Even tools like theClean & Clear Blackhead Eraser Kitmay deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas. More established tools like theClarisonic PRO Professional Skin Care Systemhave prohibitively high price tags.Many will find that the steam helps not only with skin care but also with opening the sinuses. Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses theVicks Personal Steam Inhaleris probably worth looking into. Finally, the number of creams and other cleansers that may achieve similar results without steaming is almost infinite.If you need steam at the cheapest price, this unit is a good consideration. If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another product.Enjoy."
178440,1,"I have been using the comb with revivogen for about 10 weeks, and I am very pleased with the results. The bald spot in the crown is getting smaller, and I can see lots of hair growing along the hairline, some of which have become terminal hairs. I am using the comb all over the scalp and the revivogen only on the crown and the temples. Previously, I used rogaine with mixed results. So here is my conclusion so far: 1. the comb works 2. revivogen probably helps (I will eventually cut it out) 3. rogaine only prevents the folicles from dying, but does not help grow anything. But thanks to rogaine, since the follicle did not die, the comb+revivogen is able to bring them back to full life. I really like the comb. It's a relaxing ritual, and it fluffs up your hair."
209046,2,"My hairdresser recommended this. Its a waste of money, and it is expensive. It did nothing for my hair. Morrocan Oil is much better."
55839,0,"Based on my dermatologist's recommendation, I purchased Vanicream Sport with the hopes it would allow me to wear sunblock without making my face break out. While it seems to work great for other reviewers, I didn't have the same luck. My face still broke out after I used it, about the same as if I used Eucerin or Neutrogena. It didn't cause a burning, stinging sensation like chemical sunblocks, but it didn't wash away cleanly and I ended up with pimples from that. Maybe I should have tried the version that is not water-proof, but reviewers said it was too greasy, so I went with the ""sport"" version.I would say it's still worth a try to anyone with problem skin, but it may not work for everyone."
170029,0,its a very streaky and thin. i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage! i get so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter. still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)
70095,1,"Out of all the reds I've used to color my hair, and I've used many, Red Penny is the one that got me the most compliments... perhaps really the only compliments. After using other reds, I'm going back to this one. It's hot, but very natural."

77661,0,"This is my first Nars lipgloss. I'd say the quality is good, but the color is different than I expected. I thought the color would be fairly flattering on most people, but when I apply it it is an incredibly bold fuschia color that I think will only look good on a certain number of people. I may be wrong, but it just wasn't a great buy for me in particular. But like I said, the Nars quality seems good."
207057,2,"I found it drying and a little irritating. It did nothing but upset my acne.Its also very thin and liquid, it takes quite a lot of effort to get it into a good lather. It smells odd, too, kind of like alfalfa hay.Needless to say I wasn't impressed and likely won't keep using it."
47543,0,"The Healing Mandarin Olive Oil Conditioner is certainly aiming right for the feel-good market. They have ""organic mandarin orange extracts"" in big bold letters on the front, along with ""organic olive oil"". I admit that I try to support the organic marketplace so I am probably one of the people in their target market. I really need a conditioner for my long hair, otherwise it tangles up. However, while I love organic products, I also need a product that works well and has a reasonable cost.My first comment about this conditioner is the ""cute"" container. Conditioners are generally on the thick side and to use the final part of the product you need to sit the container upside down to get all the final conditioner out. This is impossible with this curved design. Maybe they figure people ""rich"" enough to care about organic products don't care about wasting 1/10th of every bottle they buy, but I don't fall into that category. I like to use all of the bottle when I buy a bottle, and having a rolly bottle like this bothers me.At 13.8oz this is not inexpensive compared with other conditioners. I am willing to pay more if a product provides superior quality. But this conditioner just doesn't ""rise above"". My hair felt *slightly* conditioned, but not nearly as well as some of the many other products I've tested over the years. It was slightly less tangled compared with conditioner-free hair, so it is doing something, but it's not nearly as good at detangling as other conditioners are.They say that you can ""indulge your senses"" with the ""exotic blend"" - but the aroma is actually extremely faint. Generally this is fine for me, I'm not a big fan of hair perfume. However, if they are going to push the exotic orange aroma as a key selling point, I'd like to be able to smell it.It always makes me cautious when they have typos on the label. It shows a lack of attention to detail, and when I'm buying a chemically based product I want a sense that the company is on the ball in all areas. They have the description of the product as ""It's seductive invigorating scent ..."" - that should be ""Its"". Minor? Maybe. Maybe a minor change in their recipe would make the product more useful, too. If I'm going to start discussing their blurb then I also have to take issue with the ""weightless silicones"" they have in here. It's interesting that they can defy physics.Finally, the olive oil and mandarin extract are far down on the ingredient list. So this isn't an olive oil conditioner as much as it's a cetyl alcohol conditioner with a hint of olive oil.A nice idea - but not one I'll be buying again."
51778,0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers.It definitely does not have the longevity I once remembered with this fragrance. Either Burberry has changed the formula or this is a cheap, 'watered downed' version of the scent I loved (I'm guessing the latter). Do yourself - and others - a favor by coughing up the extra $20-30 and buy this at a department store and get a bottle that will last the entire day with just a spray or two."
230251,0,It was all right. I've used better shampoos before. I feel like it didn't give me enough lather. It didn't make any difference in my hair; it just made it smell like apples. I wouldn't purchase this product on my own.
136361,1,So I used this back in the day and forgot all about it until I was looking around on amazon. Im soo glad that I did because im constantly asked what im wearing or that I smell soo good I love it. Thanks
248273,0,"Well the fragrance was a big turn-off, the behavior of the little stick was OK to Good?The price & the odor are a big enough turnoff that I will not be making another purchase of this brand!"

39823,2,"I'm writing this review after owning a pair for over a year and finally stopping using it.(I was told to stick with it so I can adjust to using it - but whatever - over a year of sticking with it is enough in my opinion.) Of course everyone is different but I'd of given this product 0 stars if that option were available. Here's why:THE STRAPSeems to be this slippery strip of fabric. It doesn't feel sturdy just flimsy. My guess is that the manufacturer chose this type of strap so that it's not so tightly on that you wake up with raccoon indentations in your face. Still I suspect this is part of the reason why it doesn't stay on all night. Like another reviewer said, When I wake up I find it in on my pillow rather on my face. The other reason why I don't think it stays on is that I move around in my sleep. Seriously folks who doesn't move around in their sleep? The strap slides around and I find myself having to pull it back down in place. I even resorted to tucking them under a ponytail, or under my ears - ridiculous but true. Neither of those methods worked.THE REPLACEABLE FOAM EYE PIECESThe foam insert has 2 parts.Part 1The ring which cushions around the eye and has sticky adhesive which helps it to stay on the goggle.Part 2The insert, which you wet with water and just insert.The foam pieces are a total waste of money because the glue still doesn't help to keep the foam ring in place. In fact I've had the eye pieces come unstuck after I replaced them the day before. On the funny side of things I woke up one morning and it was all in pieces, I couldn't find one of the foam rings because it stuck to my face. They held on pretty well to my face but not the plastic which makes me wonder if the glue and the plastic are not as compatible as they ought to be.This part may not apply to everyone but I tend to sleep with my eyes open. That being said, the foam insert is much to thick and too close to my eyeball so i cut them lengthwise. Why does it have to be that thick? Our eyeballs naturally curve above the sockets so it seems odd that they make it the same thickness as the insert so it rests against the eyelid.Every evening I spend time making sure these goggles are properly assembled and hoping that they'll stay on all night. I'm sorry but if I have to think and worry about a product like this all the time then that alone is another reason why it should have 0 stars. No one should have to go through this sort of exercise on a nightly basis. I want to feel confident about my product not like I'm using a prop from a circus clown.So yes after all that time I attempted to use these I gave up because I absolutely hate them. I'm amazed that they haven't collected all the reviews out there on the web about their product and tried modifying it based on feedback. It looks like it's been the same since the product came out. They've only introduced add-ons which are fine, but please fix the fundamental issues. It's no good if it doesn't totally stay on our mugs."
44916,0,So do NOT care for this scent. It smells like vanilla vanilla vanilla. YUCKERS! It's not sexxxy...it's airfreshner and nothing like what I sampled @ Sephora :(
105309,1,Don't care much for the artist himself. The cologne is fantastic. Have been using it for the past 2 years and still love it. Long lasting too.
153901,0,"I normally use the body shop's body butter, which is GREAT, but I wanted to switch to a low-budget option. Many reviewers raved about the cetaphil cream and how it can be used for everything. Sounds great... if it only wasn't so greasy. I noticed how my leather arm chair was really shiny every time I put some on my arm. This stuff really gets everywhere. And I had to stop using this on my face due to grease. Yes, a little definitely goes a long way with cetaphil! But overall, I found it far far far too greasy.This tub is huge so it's gonna take a while to use it up."
10261,0,"I wanted a mirror with a regular mirror and a magnified one. If it went the other direction or was round versus oval, maybe I could see my whole face on the magnified side. A bit dissapointing."

223920,1,Bought this for my grandmother as a gift. She loves it. Shipped very quickly!
142584,1,"This is wonderful to apply to your skin immediately after washing with the du du osun african black soap. It makes your skin SO SOFT!! It also helps decrease the appearance of blemishes, and helps sooth small cuts. Great stuff! I'm impressed"
97700,0,"Nothing special, smells OK, but no attraction factor, it also lasts for a very short time. Smell is gone probably within 30 minutes. Got it as a gift, but would not pay this money for it. There are much better choices for the price. This one you are just paying for the name."
222224,2,"I bought this because they ran out of my usual Biolage product in the store. So I thought I'd give this a try. I thought for the price, it's gotta be doing something.Given my experience, you shouldn't judge any product upon first use. So I gave Bumble and Bumble thickening conditioner a week. Now I can say for certain that I absolutely am not impressed by it. In fact, I hate the way it makes my hair feel. I have never truly understood the meaning of ""fly away hair"" until this week. Yes with this conditioner my hair is flying everywhere all right. I have thick hair shaft but slightly thinning hair (big hair strand but not a lot of it, if you know what I mean). And this product just makes it completely unmanageable. It does not create any volume, it make my hair hard to hold style. The only positive side that I can think of is that it has a pleasant smell. But it is not a top priority to me when it comes to hair products-- I want GOOD hair, not just PLEASANTLY PERFUMED hair.I wish I could return this useless, expensive bottle of goo. But I can't, so I am just going to get on with it and return to my favorite Biolage detangling solution."

89594,1,"It usually takes forever for me to dry my hair, but it dried really fast and STRAIGHT! I can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer! And the color is beautiful... I just love orange :O)"

28990,1,"I love this stuff The smell is so clean and fresh, this is probably the 10th buy of it since my daughter gave me some as a gift , 5 years ago. I wont be able to afford it as I am retiring and this was a good buy"
139223,0,"Nature's Gate Herbal Daily Shampoo is a product we have been using for several years, refilling our pump bottle from the large gallon size as needed. For some reason, without changing the name, Nature's Gate has changed the product significantly, and not for the better. Previously, the product was a yellowish, clear gel that poured easily, lathered easily and had a light, delicate fragrance. The product is now MUCH thicker, making it difficult to pour from the gallon bottle to a pump bottle, and is now opaque off-white, which is less of a concern, but it is not as esthetically pleasing as it was before (in fact, several years ago, this product was a beautiful 'aloe' green, and the company elected to change the color to a rather uninteresting yellow, but that's old news).This was a great product before its current incarnation -- not so much now. I don't think I will purchase it again."
177121,0,"One of the principal ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a known skin irritant, which is noted in many articles from reputable organizations easily found on the web. Neutrogena bar soap is famously free of such irritants, and consumers may be inclined to trust the Rainbath Gel because it shares the Neutrogena name. So, buy it if you like it, but don't buy it if you are looking for a non-irritating soap to use in the shower!"

160839,2,"Can't beat the price, but I guess in the long run, you do get what you pay for. This iron works great, just as good as the high priced brands, however, it doesn't last very long as the gold plating wears off quick ( about 5 uses) and then it started to frizz the hair and with each use it became less effective."

Well not a damn thing happened!this crap doesn't work either cause it doesn't or the fact that it expired in 2006!gtfoh!!! I'm sure the company knew before they shipped this mess out.btw it smells like furniture wood polish.DONT BUY ! ITS A LIE! UPDATE 03/15/2012: IT DOES WONDERS ON UNTREATED WOOD!

I was upset though when I received my purchase that it was not at all as it was shown in their advertisement.They had a picture of a larger size of the Toppik, 25gm, yet I was sent the small one, 10.3gm?I was not very pleased to say the least when I open the package..Besides being mislead, the product itself is fine.."
174952,2,Not only does this leave your hair very dry but it left my hair with an ugly dishwater blonde instead of an actual strawberry blonde. YUCK. Will not buy again.
170582,0,"The color is amazing, but the polish is very thin. Every brushstroke leaves visible imperfections. It's very hard to get an even coat due to it's watery-consistency. I would expect this from a cheap wal-mart brand of polish, not this. Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied."
167828,0,"It smells like grass almost and a few hours later i smell it and relate it to the smell of Raid roach spray.But I asked one girl, she liked it. But i don't like it too much.

133874,0,"its really bright, had to bleach my hair first cause its dark, and it looked great the first couple of days, but quickly faded once I had to wash my hair."
71459,0,"I got this product in may of last year, and as i saw for the first few months it was a miracle product! i gave some to and recommended it to some of my friends and they love it! All was well until about a month ago...My skin had started getting oily (never was before!!! at all...) and my pores were huge! there was random red dicoloration and my skin just did not look healthy.... I used it once a day in the shower and i sleep in a coffin like way with my face up for my hair etc.) I mean this product was great until the last month. Two months ago it would have gotten a perfect rating. I ordered the Queen helene Mint Julepe masque and that is really nice and after using it my skin was not oily at all the next day! (not to mention the other benefits, pore tightening etc.)And i do think it stopped cleaning my acne aswell, i had numerous blackheads and more than the usual pimples. very strange to say the least.I dont know if this has happened to other people but i just wanted people to know that this can happen and that your skin develops a tolerance to products!!good luck!"
62717,2,"the bottles were smaller than I had imagined (and I knew they'd be small). the caps are almost impossible to get off. I have to get the cap off with my teeth. I hope they manufacture the regular size spray soon, or ever."
184178,0,Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty. Basically anything china glaze is pretty awesome.
2272,0,"Although this product works okay, the fact it is a gel left my skin somewhat sticky. I had ordered Banana Boat LOTION and prefer it over the gel. Probably would not order the gel again."
208220,2,"My hair type, very fine. Was damaged after using this product. It might work for others."
244707,0,"I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's. After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs. I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product. I thought they only sold products with AHAs. Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."
123753,0,"I really wanted to like this product. It did smooth out my skin and the foundation glided right over, the only thing I did not like is it made my skin break out. I have combination skin so maybe that is the problem. I noticed they have a non-oil primer too and I might try that."
189730,0,"I really like the concept around this product. The microfiber cloth is absorbent *enough* and it does the job very well. I have extremely thick hair and it's very nice to be able to wrap it up and out of the way as it dries, leaving me free to brush my teeth and apply makeup without my wet hair getting in the way.However, the construction of the head wrap, even as simple as it is, is of poor quality. The wrap is fastened at the nape of the neck by a large button that snapped off with first wear.I would not buy this product again. Rather, I'll buy the material and make one myself."
81439,0,"I had high hopes for this product. Trying to find a shampoo or conditioner that actually works on scalp itch is an arduous process to say the least. The product sounded encouraging, but unfortunately I could not find an accurate ingredients list. When I tried it, I was quite disappointed to feel the typical sensation of menthol. Menthol is a gimmick and there is no evidence that it actually treats the scalp; rather, it gives you ""the feeling"" that something is going on, providing basically a placebo effect. Reputable companies would more than likely refrain from such tactics. The overall result was so-so, but I wish they would eliminate any gimmicks."
2821,1,I liked the 3 in one product for my granddaughter. Heats up fast and less clutter in the bathroom.Plus i love shopping online.
1353,0,"This cologne smells great don't get me wrong. However, when I took it out of the box it felt half full. I'm not sure if it's because of the design of the container or what but for $50 there are other colognes out there that smell just as good, provide you with more quantity and are less expensive. Shop around before you make a decision."
230938,0,"I've been using this product for like 3 weeks already. It does improve my dark circles but only to a SMALL extent. The result isn't obvious at all. My boyfriend even said there is no difference at all. Anyway, I will continue using this bottle to see if it really works on me. Maybe it really takes time to see the result??"
109768,2,"This cologne is great, I've wore it for years, however this merchant is selling a counterfeit product. Typically i can put this on and the smell last all day and i can even pick up my shirt the next day from my floor and still smell it. BUT, this merchants COUNTERFEIT product doesn't last 30mins. Thanks for ripping me off of my hard earned money buddy!!!"
131057,0,I am very satisfied with the service I received from this company. I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one. I am very grateful for that. They were very courteous and didn't even cause me any additional costs. They are very helpful and respond promptly. Thank you for being so prompt and kind in this matter.
201511,0,"Product came in an unattractive solid plastic bottle==not clear as pictured.The pump sprayer does not work well. You really have to work at it to get cologne to spray.

89218,0,The dryer is pretty lightweight and quiet. Leaves my hair free of frizzies so for me it passes the test just a tad expensive. The cord coRd be a little longer and I woujd liek a few more accessories but by and large a good buy
56573,0,This oil is odorless. I bought it thinking it would smell like sweet almond but it doesn't. You could probably add your favorite fragrance essential oil to this to create your own blend.
180463,2,"This was a household standby for easily ten years. Recently, I purchased 5 bottles only to find that the scent has changed from a natural, lovely fragrance of lavender to a pungent, chemically odor. I would never recommend this product to anyone again unless they have no sense of smell."
201057,0,"In the short term, this product is satisfactory. If you need to color your hair and can't get to it before tonight's dinner, you can cover reasonably well for the evening. By tomorrow, don't plan on it being there any more, even without washing your hair."

44992,0,"the hold on this hair spray is great. It holds as good as a regular hair spray. It flakes a bit and I am not a fan of the smell.Aside from those minor complaints, I still think this is a legitimate alternative to the average drug store hair spray which is full of toxic chemicals."

154040,1,"I was having a very hard time finding this lotion.None of the big stores would handle this lotion. A friend told me to try Amazon.com and I found it. A little expensive but worth it. I was having a hard time with my hands and nails and this was the only lotion that truly works. I did send a e-mail to the company and it is still available. Hope they never discontinue. Thank you Amazon.com. You saved my hands and nails.Christy, South Dakota"
166762,0,"Although I am a heavy allergy-sufferer, I typically do not have problems with skin products. This one, however, broke me out in hives like crazy. Really bummed because I was happy with the color I got out of it!So you may consider testing a skin patch before putting it all over your body, if you have an inclination to allergies."
169040,0,"I don't think it's anything special, especially for the price. Could have probably done just as well with one of the ordinary product lines out there."
176223,2,"I don't get many pimples anymore but once in a while I will get one and it definitely stands out. I purchased this product after reading some good things on the internet and I have tried it several different times on several different pimples and it seems to have no affect whatsoever. I follow the directions and apply it after cleansing my face, usually before bed and throughout the day, but still see no reduction in size at all. I understand certain products will work differently for everyone, this one just happened to not work at all for me."
212466,2,I was terribly disappointed that I ordered this product from Amazon. I ordered a bottle for my daughter's birthday and ordered a bottle for my self as well. I ordered the product on February 7th and still had not received the product or any notification from Amazon on March 1st. I finally had to track down a customer service person (which was not easy) and they didn't know where the product was either. They said that they would credit my account and that was about the end of it. No real apology for having missed my daughter's birthday or what happened. I don't think I will use amazon again.Delices De Cartier By Cartier For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz
25535,0,Still not sure - I find it difficult to apply and doesn't seem to go on smoothly. It is also very difficult to figure out what shade you need online.
10173,0,"I purchased this product for my 16 year old son who struggles with acne. He has tried many of the products out there. Antibiotics worked best, but had undesirable side-effects for a distance runner. (I don't think they should be over-used anyway.) I read previous reviews that suggested this product smells unpleasant, but he actually likes the smell and I don't think it's bad...a little earthy perhaps. I am sure it is great for some people, but it has not been the exact right thing for him. Also, I'm not sure how the price for such a small amount is justified. We'll keep trying."
51640,2,I feel like that it is water down. It smells good at first but then it doesn't stick. I ask everyone if they can smell my cologne and they cannot. I had sprayed it 3 times over my body. 2 Stars because I can smell a feint of it.
38001,0,"Followed instructions and it seemed ok...there were water spots after treatment and squeege. After second shower, even more water spots."
56929,2,This is the second bottle I have ordered. Both are stale and lack little fragrence. Would never buy it again. Totally unhappy with this product.
161636,0,The Petite Nail Care system does a great job if you have the time. The power unit is just like the units for hair removal. I don't know how long the abrasive pads will last. They include one spare set but don't mention how to get more abrasive pads. All in all a good but overpriced unit. If you can't get additional abrasive pads then this unit is disposable.
54083,2,"The design for this product is flawed. The clips that hold the curlers on are: 1. way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set or else it wouldn't work and, 2. fall all over the place because there isn't a place on the product to hold them. How hard would it be to create a few holes to hold the clips?The curlers do heat up pretty fast and I like that there are two sizes."
66429,0,This is a pretty good curling iron except for the fact that the heating element took a dump and the thing wasn't that old!
150411,0,This stuff is ok but it didn't work any miracles. I probably wouldn't order it again. It's not silky feeling like normal conditioner.
185106,2,We have had one of these in our house since my son was born and he is 5. It is awesome to cut his hair and it all goes into the vacuum and is easy to dump.. very easy clean up. The cutting of the blades sometimes leaves streaky marks on his head but he thinks it is cool. Sometimes it pulls his hair when it is too long instead of cutting it. We use it only to cut his hair and if you want your kid to have anything but a buzz cut I wouldn't purchase. For us it works because he likes it like the cutter cuts :).

However, I simply could not believe it when I found the products on AMAZON (my fave ""store"").I'm nearly 40 years old and already notice a minimal difference in my skin texture!! I say ""minimal"" because the age process is ""a process,"" we all must deal with it. However, with the Jason products I am SO satisfied with the results.

Enough said.....wish I could include a photo of mum.Okay the NEGATIVES: The products arrived rather LATE...not a huge deal to me as I was kept notified via my mobile.The worst thing I noticed, all I'll I can write this verbatim: ""Due to the high levels of Vitamin C, product may darken to a brownish-orange over time.""Yuck. I had my store bought products and they never turned ""brown."" The consistency of the product, for example, the Ester C Hyper-Serum anti-aging therapy WAS ""BROWN.""S0 I'll have to hunt and search for a retailer/seller that can provide experation dates on the products: (ALSO, A DIRECTION FOR USE insert was NOT PROVIDED)All in all, despite my initial excitement over the product (that hasn't changed), I suppose I'm rather afraid that I bought ""Old Stuff,"" cosmetics that should have been 'tossed' in good ethics.Hope to hear from you.

After gagging for a few seconds, she bagan to vomit! She must have vommited 4 times that first day. But, she did quit sucking her thumb for 2 STRAIGHT days, which was a miricle in itself. I guess the taste has wore off though, because she's sucking her thumb again. I want to put this stuff back on her thumb, but her daddy says no. I guess we'll see?! I tried it my self, to see what the big deal was, and this stuff is horrible! It taste like a mix of nail polish and asprin! And once it hits your tounge, it spreads over your whole mouth!

This one has a special comb that holds the hair behind the ear and is just what I needed. It&#8217;s a great product and I had a wonderful experience with this seller!

71380,0,My hair is really black so when I put it on and there wasn't much change in my hair color I wasn't surprised but what really got to me were the stains that it left behind. Some of the product fell on the counter and when I wiped it off there was a whole bunch of pink leftover. Also do as it says do not let the product touch your scalp because tight now my scalp is hot pink. My hands and nails are still pink because I made an elementary mistake and washed the product out without any gloves on.
174689,0,"of course the color you get not same as on box. If hair is natural black, color will be orange at first then in a week or so color will adjust.

I get random small pimples once or twice a month (even more around that time of the month) but this lotion made three pimples appear in my face by day 4. I wasn't 100% sure if it was the lotion so I continued using it. At the end of the week I had around seven pimples all over my face. My face was not flattering from any angle! I stopped using it right away and my face went back to normal in two weeks. Not ready to throw away all my money, I decided a few weeks later to try this on my boyfriend and see what happen. He noticed the same breakout problem without me saying anything about the lotion. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's prone to acne."

145473,0,"I have a feeling that the this bottle of Strivectin is very old. I was expecting a white cream but instead got a brown one. There doesn't appear to be a expiration date either. So far, it's a nice moisturizer. Haven't noticed anything else. I will not be buying expensive creams online again."
45486,0,"I bought this and still like this fragrance but it's not exactly how I remembered. From memory, I was expecting a lighter and sweeter, yet masculine, fragrance. Instead I got a strong fragrance that almost smells like a cheap fragrance. But this scent changes rapidly throughout the day. From the moment you put it on to the time you go to bed, you will smell several different notes and sometimes I did smell the light and sweet fragrance I remembered -- I just wish it was more dominant."
110908,0,"This product did not dry out my skin as much as most acne products do. It didn't take away all my acne but it did seem to dry out some of my spots. I'll continue using it to see if maybe the longer you use it, the more it will clear up."
141959,2,I purchased this thinking it will be less oily. Yes it is not oily but did absolutely nothing for me. Its too expensive for the results achieved. I am considering trying another product line going forward
38144,1,I have worn this perfume for over 20 years. I love it! I get headaches from many perfumes. This one is subtle and very pleasant. I always get compliments on how good I smell. It's not one of those floral scents that gag everyone around you. I highly recommend it!
240401,2,"Purchased several at one time and not one will hold a point. Sharpen and break . . . sharpen and break. No matter how easy you are they break. A pencil a week is a little too expensive. Other brands have held up with sharp points these will not! Once a bad pencil but after several, a bad product."
213784,2,I thought I was getting a great bargain for Brit Burberry..bought it..and found the fragrance to be different than the ones selling at the store..is this the real thing..if I am buying fake perfume..I rather pay more next time..than to have a diff smell...
17357,2,"I returned this product because of its ridulously exaggerated price. The price has tripled since my last purchase; at which time I paid $6.96 each and I purchased six. The price has now escalated to $19.95 each in the space of months. Some one, either Amazon or Proctor and Gambel, needs to take a close look the marketing of this product since it it not available in any store and the price online is outrageous. Maybe they (P&G) just don't want to make and sell it any more. But at $19.95, I'll find something else to use; and I've been using this product since I was sixteen and that's fifty five years ago!"
65501,0,"My wife liked it.I thought it was very pricey.Attractive bottle, though. Are you paying for the the name, the bottle or the fragrance?"
35284,1,"After the salon over highlighted my hair, I needed a product to tone it down, but still leave the highlights and low lights. Roux Fanci-Full Rinse did the trick. It's a temporary product, so even if you aren't happy with the color, it washes out. You add 1 oz. to hair after shampooing and then style as usual, it couldn't be easier. One bottle will work for 15 shampoos. This is not the color that I used, but the Roux product line is great. Give it a try."
104963,0,"The lotion hydrates and is pretty thick, however it's not really organic and it smells kind of weird. I still like it though."
125837,0,"I ordered the large paddle brush as a replacement for my ancient one, and I love it! Best brush I've ever had -- goes through my long hair easily, no snags, and untangles in seconds. I'm super impressed.So I ordered the small oval version for my desk drawer at work. Wholly different brush -- maybe it's something about the tighter curvature of the rubber base into which the bristles stick, but this brush just pulls my hair out. I'm using it for a few days to see if I can't fill the little gaps with hair so it turns into a smaller cousin of the awesome big paddle one, but so far I'm disappointed."
102847,2,These sponges were listed as Natural Silk Sea Sponge that were very soft and they are in fact very rough and not soft at all. I am very very disappointed in this product and would never order this again. I was really looking forward to receiving a very soft sponge as the item had listed.
221026,0,"If you are buying jojoba oil, you are aware of the benefits. My problem with this brand is that the bottle is plastic, not glass. The people who grow the jojoba bean expressly recommend that the jojoba oil should be stored in glass, never plastic. I returned this item immediately and without problem to Amazon. My only complaint was nowhere in the product description was the jojoba container identified as either glass or plastic. A waste of time and the return shipping fees. Oh well."
35265,1,"I used to be able to buy this locally but now I can't find it anywhere so I rely on shopping online. (The Root Cellar is a good source when they have sales, and Amazon is good too.) I have never found another lotion like this. It absorbs into the skin beautifully, keeps your skin soft, the scent is subtle but lovely, and when I try other ones they just don't measure up. I'll keep spending the extra $ on Terra Nova. Love the Rain and Ocean scents, but it's the texture and what it does to your skin that keeps me coming back."
116826,0,"My wife received this item as a Christmas gift. She loves the effects but we both agree that the heat from the wax is painful and difficult to fully enjoy. I normally could care less about these type of items as a typical guy, but my wife insisted that she was my elbows. We had a deal with some bargaining so I let her have her fun.Well, it is HOTTER than hades and I just can't appreciate the after effects. It was supposed to take some of the excess skin off and make it smoother (after she spent time pre-cleaning.) Seems as if I might have needed 3 treatments!!! I guess I don't see what the big ballyhoo is, but then again, I'm just a guy! ;-)For what it's worth, my wife likes the effects she received, but she wasn't thrilled with the pain of the heat. To each his/her own I reckon. We both wish it had a temperature control. I don't know if others have it or not but it sure would be nice!"
55544,2,"I have purchased this twice, thinking that I had bought the wrong color for my skin tone. It isn't an inexpensive product, so I ended up spending over $80 for it.It wasn't my skin tone, it was the product. I have read so many raves about this stuff, but it seems heavy and goopy, and looks artificial. If I wanted this kind of product, I would have been just as well getting a drug store foundation and saved the money.I tried to purchase this in person, but the only way to get this is on line. So there is not really any choice in testing it out.Save your money."
160771,1,"them. I use the half lashes the most, though. They tend to give me a ""fuller"" look without looking fake. The other ones are a little overpowering, tho. Easy to apply.."
31667,0,"The bristles are very coarse, so they do grab your hair, but they are much too rough for my taste. Also, beware of some major staticSeems like it might be well suited for curly or wavy hair.Overall it does work, and it was worth $8, but i'm definitely not as impressed as i had hoped to be."
141526,0,"these are good for samll work, the magnifying glass is a nice touch."
77796,0,"I recently purchased the nars turkish delight and it is definitely not what I expected. It makes my lips looks kind of dead and I am of an medium to olive complexion. Try it on before you buy it, do not just purchase it online like I did."
2860,0,"THE STEEL USED FOR THESE SCISSORS IS NOT THE BEST QUALITY & THEY ARE NOT COMFOTABLE IN YOUR HAND BECAUUSE OF THE DESIGHN OF THEM, THE WAY THE STEEL IS SHAPED,THAT IS WHERE YOU HOLD THEM IN YOUR FINGERS. ALSO THE BLUNT ENDS ARE TO LARGE TO ALOW FOR EASY TRIMMING IN CORNERS & HARD TO REACH PLACES IN NOSE & EARS. REDDOG OVER & OUT."
112060,1,I have used White Diamonds for years and love it. Good Product !I would recommend it to every woman and have them give it a try !
75774,0,"I really love the way this smells and it only has a minor tingle. I had a decent size trial so I used it at lease five times. But I am not fully sold on it. I wanted to really like it, but it just didn't seem that much better than my usual way of doing a natural peel (putting a paste of crushed pineapple and coconut milk on my face). Maybe I will try it again down the road, but it just doesn't seem to do much for now."
100970,1,"Like the scent, it's one of my favs, I use it as a baseIt's strong enough to stand alone, which is nice"
208025,0,"In an effort to put a stop my nail-biting routine, I decided to apply some clear nail polish to my fingernails every once in a while. While the polish does its job well (it doesn't taste awful but reminds me that I shouldn't bite my nails :P) it also comes off pretty easily. The layer of polish will consistently come off a couple days after its application, and is quite easy to peel off manually when it does. I suppose it would probably last longer when applied over another layer of nail polish, but still."
244913,1,"This is a great product simply because it is absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn't clog pores and moisturizes without leaving my skin oily."
218827,1,"I have finally found a curling brush with a 1 1/2 inch barrel that will produce excellent results! When using previous curling brushes, the bristles would often either cling too strongly to my hair causing horrible snarls, or the brush would not hold the hair in place so that it could curl. Helen of Troy has solved both of these issues with the creation of a curling iron with a 1 1/2 inch barrel consisting of bristles that are flexible and allow my longer hair to wrap loosely around the brush to create just the right amount of wave. This is an excellent product and I am thrilled with the results."
18408,0,I bought this thinking the pen would be full when I got it...WRONG..it is LESS THAN HALF FULL..and you have to really work and beat and click ot get it out..then its goopy...and thick and is almost invisible...it isnt the pink I thought it would be and its just a gooey mess..I will not buy this again
115217,1,"I love the light fresh lavender scent of this paraffin. Also, the wax really mositures your hands after removing them from the paraffin bath."
99089,0,This towel isn't exactly thick and lush but I have thin shoulder length hair so it can suck up enough water to work for me. If I had more hair I think I would be disappointed.
171925,0,"I bought the small bottle to try it out before purchasing the larger size. I'm glad I did. It isn't a bad product, but definitely isn't anything special and not worth the premium price."
201297,2,I have to agree with a previous review. I end up using about three times as much as other body washes because it hardly suds. It's almost like washing with lotion. I will keep looking for a more natural body wash.
119620,0,"I've been using this steamer for 6 months. If you are looking for strong steaming action, this is NOT the product for you. The only way I could get a good steam was to put a towel over my head while using it. Some days it steams really well and other days it doesn't. Not sure why this happens. I don't steam for more than 11 minutes and it works okay. The warm up takes a few minutes (make sure you have the water in before turning it on because doing the opposite may not produce a good steam before the beep). The quality is good and it has held up for me so far. I don't use the accessories (brush etc). I wish it steamed a bit stronger and was more consistent day to day. All in all it does what it's suppose to."
86759,0,"We tried Mavala Stop at the recommendation of the pediatrician and dentist. It worked for about 2 weeks then she was back to sucking her fingers again. I have to admit, if it was me, I would stop, but my daughter is strong willed and would rather put up with the aweful taste then stop sucking her fingers.I think the product will work for most, but not for the extremely stubborn."
94027,1,HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS MORE THICKER. I JUST SPRAY AT ROOTS ON TOP AND SIDES AND STYLE. LOVE THE FULLNESS.
61794,2,My father has used this product for 30 years and now has problems with his nervous system and stomach. I am now caring for him and I discovered that these are long-term lead associated symptoms. He also smells extremely bad from the sulpher in the product. I have to soak his shirts for 24 hours before laundrying. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT
205191,1,Big savings purchasing this on Amazon compared to retail prices at department or perfume stores. Vendor also proved reliable in terms of speed delivery and packaging.
32877,1,i use these for my frown nightly.. also i get a headache from frowning at night.. they prevent my headaches and i have no frowns. i never had botox. these are better and cheaper than botox.
35107,1,This cream is really great as well as smelling good. I am in water alot and my fingers get rough and cracked. The glycerin Rosewater cream works .
192756,2,For the price of this and the raving reviews about it winning world class rewards...I can't see why. I put it on and the scent only lasts about 5 seconds. Doesn't work for me apparently.
165496,0,"I have been using a hair serum to smooth and condition my hair for some time. I finally used up my bottle so put out feelers for a new product. Unfortunately, most of the products recommended to me are not available at Wal-mart in the middle of the ngiht so I opted for John Frieda Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum rather than the one other product, despite its higher price tag.I suffer with some frizz and fly-aways, especially because my hair is so fine. It can look pretty unkempt only a short time after I brush it so I wanted a product which would smooth it and not let it be quite so unruly. While Frizz Ease Extra Strength Serum does work, it's rather heavy and leaves my hair feeling greasy.This serum is very comparable to Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum although I prefer the bottle because it looks sleeker (but it comes in a much smaller bottle). Frizz Ease Serum does a better job, in my opinion, but does not smell as nice. It does not smell unpleasant but it does smell a bit too much like perfume and chemicals to me.The bottle instructs to apply a dime sized amount to wet hair. Oddly enough, the official website says to use a quarter sized amount and I think this makes more sense. I like to apply the serum to my brush so my hands do not get greasy. Unfortunately, whether I am using my brush or my hands, the product does not apply evenly. The first area where I apply the product tends to get a thick coating and the rest of my hair sees much less. Of course, this is a problem with any serum.What I do not especially like is how greasy my hair feels. It does not necessarily look greasy but if I touch it with my hands or feel my hair brush my face, I can tell. My hair generally looks really sleek and shiny but it does not have a lot of movement because of the heavy serum which makes clumps of hair stick together. At one point, it even left clumpy residue like cheaper gels. Other people probably wouldn't notice because I am the only one staring so intently at my hair, however.The problem is, that if I use less, it really doesn't work all that well. Even having my hair greasy, I'd say only about 75% of my fly-aways and frizz is smoothed down. While this is a decent amount, especially in humid San Antonio, I was looking for something that worked a little better, especially from such a big name.I think what it most disappointing is how long the bottle lasts. I've only have it a few weeks and it is already about halfway gone. When I used the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, it was in a much larger bottle that literally lasted me years.Overall, Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum is a product which works with a few drawbacks and has a price tag that will quickly add up with how frequently you will have to replace the product. I will keep on in my search for the perfect frizz product."
12776,0,"I bought this thinking it was a matte color instead of a shimmery, pearly teal. It's a nice color and covers pretty well, but it wasn't what I was expecting or what I prefer at all."
10041,0,"THE FIRST BOX OF PRODUCT WAS MISSING ITEMS WHICH I DISCOVERED WHEN DID HAIR SECOND TIME. THAT FIRST BOX ALSO DID NOT COVER THE GRAY YET KEPLT ON OVER THIRTY MINUTES AND IT HAD PEROXIDE AND COLORING STUFF. THE SECOND BOX HAD MORE ITEMS AND I KEPT IT ON OVER THIRTY MINUTES, TOO. THAT SECOND ONE COEVRED GREY TO EXTENT THAT I THUS HAD STREAKS OF THE BLONDE WHICH IS OKAY. I HAVE NOT OPENED THE THIRD BOX."
93425,1,The product is always consistent with the expectation so that is outstanding. The product came when expected and what is expected.
101748,1,"The best thing out there!!! Love this nail product,it is a great way to jazz up your nail polish. After you use it make sure to put a clear coat on top to protect and give it shine!"
28202,1,"Another great philosophy product. While you can feel the granules, they are not too large or harsh. I can use this everyday without any problem, and it makes my face feel so smooth."
228010,1,"I had green hair and rather than bleach it and redye, I opted for this instead. It worked perfectly! I dyedmy hair purple after this and it looked perfect!"
240679,2,"I love Aqua Di Gio, but that's not what I received from Globalworx. I can't even describe what came out of the bottle! FAKE! Not even close! No cellophane wrapping on box and bottle seems to have been tampered with. I have never had this problem with an Amazon merchant before. I am very disappointed in merchant and Amazon. Maybe Amazon doesn't need my business anymore. I sure they probably don't care. How unfortunate."
78198,0,"I gave three stars because my hair feeling good after applying this cream, but it is absolutely does not cover gray, so if you want a little shine to your hair use it."
152636,0,"I bought this perfume by mistake, I was actually trying to buy Essencia de Duende, which is a favorite perfume of mine -- Essencia has a very light scent, with a lemon-y undertone. This perfume, ""Duende"" is a little heavier, not a lot, but it's a noticeably bolder scent than Essencia de Duende and is not such a 'natural' scent as Essencia. Duende seems to have a more 'processed' flavor, it's not as subtle as Essencia. I don't absolutely dislike it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
218886,2,"Must confess that this perfume did certainly live up to its name - A Contradiction to the very concept of a perfume. I wonder how customers have been able to give it a 5 star. I brought this brand, because of the Calvin Klien image, and seeing the reviews. The perfume smelled sick and to top it in a matter of a month, the fragrance seemed missing...it was like spraying water...A loss of $28 :("
145807,2,I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It's completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!
144522,1,"I've used this product for several years now and I always receive compliments on my skin. I highly recommend it. Also I think ""Fragrance Free"" is much better because Olay's fragrance makes you smell like a grandma (let's avoid that), I feel they should really rework the brand's fragrance. So make sure you choose ""Fragrance free.""I think this product compare to other serum with a higher price point.Great product."
67866,1,This is the only product to use if you have curly hair. It holds the curls and controlls frizzies. AWESOME!!!
186803,1,"This is a great product from L'Oreal, Love it! Sublime Bronze Dual Action Instant Bronzer & Self - Tanning Lotion for the Face.This is a super great bronzer that adds a natural pretty color for my face. I use it daily in the morning, just a very small amount is needed. Does not clog my pores and contains vitamin E for smoother skin. Turns to a natural looking tan that is the perfect shade! I have found this product very hard to find available for sale in the retail stores, and online for that mattter. Some sellers on Amazon are asking 50 dollars and MORE for is product. That is not a very fair price. A more realistic price is under 25 dollars which I was able to purchase it for. I would highly recommend trying this product!"
69335,0,"My aunt gave me this lotion when she stopped tanning and I was a little skeptical because I usually buy lotions from the salon. The first time I used it I was impressed with how good it actually worked on my skin. It gave me decent color, a little orange, but it made my skin feel smooth and soft all day after I tanned. You did have to rub it in really well so that it would not streak but for the price, it worked well."
173839,0,"With shipping I paid about $10 for one of these poufs. It wasn't silky like the ones from Bath & Body Works. It's kind rough and slightly cheap feeling. It works good in the shower though, only need a little bit of body gel and it exfoliates well."
159799,2,I ordered this product for an overseas plane trip. It was nearly impossible to inflate without a compressor. I don't take compressors with me on trips.
81026,1,"I bought this to put behind my ears. Seemed like no matter how much I scrubbed behind them with soap and water in the shower, they'd still have a foul odor a few hours later. Just run it under water for a second and rub behind the ears. I never have any odor behind the ears anymore and the product applies easily and doesn't feel like there's anything there."
36655,0,"Doesn't soak up the oil for long, but I have extremely oily skin. This will work great for moderately oily skin."
21339,0,I like it for that fact that it's easy to put on. Spray is very convenient. The bad is you look so shiny. Looks like you've been laminated with a layer or glass.
22265,1,Love love love this color! Great product & high quality polish! Seems to last longer than most! Love it a lot!
80779,1,"I like this product, and the plumpling last for hours. at least 4 or 5 hours, which is a lot. I like the texture too, it is not stiky at all. I used to use Lancome plumpling, and it was way more expensive, the effect lasted a lot less that the lip fusion's. So 4 stars for this one."
123520,0,"They must have changed the formula since I last used it as a teen/twenty's. I remember this as smelling like being in a heady lemon dream that would last for hours.Now its like maybe a drift of lemon and the scent dissipates almost as soon as skin is dry from application. I only gave it a 3 because it did arrive well packed and in good condition. It's not anything like it used to be though, even in the bottle there is almost no smell. I wanted LEMON and I got almost citrus and a lot of carrier alcohol and water. I wish they had left the formula alone as it used to be wonderful."
101220,2,When OPI came out with another color if the crackel I was thrilled. The Black crakel was awesome and I always had people asking about it. I have tried the silver twice and it just does not work as well. The colors and effect is not as eye catching and it really does not look right. I would not recommend it.
47586,2,"This smelled ""ok"" I guess. Thats all I can say that is positive. It literally stripped the keratin treatment from my hair, which ironically is WHY i bought this product in the first place. So much for cheap being ""good""....Would NOT recommend as a product to use to lengthen the time a keratin therapy will last.Works OK as a body wash, although it lacks a nice aroma..."
181256,2,The product I received should have been pulled from stock. The cream has a slight musty smell. The color is wrong too. I went into to Nordstrom and compared the product color. The cream should be a light pink color. The cream I received is more the color of medium biege.
102033,1,"This hair clippers is smooth and easy to use and maintain. It's cordless and that makes it easy to cut those hard to reach spots. I use the cord when cutting the front and sides and go cordless when cutting the back because the battery dies after 20 minutes or so. Otherwise, they work great!"
198389,0,"This product is pretty good, considering the fact that it looks like its gonna break within 50 uses. Seriously though, from all the reviews from amazon raving about how great this product is, it definitely, DENFINITELY looks really cheap. I would expect this kind of product to be sold for 35 dollars, not even, from Target or Walmart. It has no temperature control but it adjusts temperature by itself. The LED light blinks by itself most of the time which is nerveracking because I don't know when it's gonna break or not work or have temperature malfunction. Good thing about this product is that it heats up VERY QUICKLY! within 4 minutes tops! but the architecture of the product leaves me wondering if its sturdy enough for it to last me for long compared with the price im paying. I really like it but I'm going to return this because it looks like its gonna break soon. Design is not well thought out."
34007,0,"I was disappointed because this shower gel smells nothing like the perfume which I love! It smells good, just not like the perfume. Disappointed."

170238,1,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The color is fantastic and the compliments have been endless. It matches my green sweater perfectly!
194505,1,I had gotten my nails done with shellac and my friend wanted a similar color in regular nail polish. I found this and she loved it! China glaze is awesome nail polish as well but is a little pricey.
42785,1,"Besides the compliments I get on my fragrance, there is also many times during my day that people ask ""what are you wearing"". Who doesn't like to answer back...""oh, it's CHANEL."" LOL It's a bit more sophisticated than What I usually wear ( burberry of london ) and I feel like it's just a little more mature if you know what I mean. I'm 26 and I think it's a great scent for women my age that are changing more and more every DAY. You guys should get a sample at a perfume store and if you like it, come on Amazon and get a super price for it. I think I paid 52 bux for my 1 oz. bottle of eau de toilet. GREAT PRICE. -Jessica C.

82550,0,I have the 2 inch but i never really used it on wet hair because when i did it would sizzle and steam. Its okay but the coating is starting to wear off. Its good for fine to medium hair.
54688,0,"This product is just okay. I thought it was the same one I purchased in Hong Kong(Comptoir Sud Pacifique Tiare). That had staying power. This one just fades away within about an hour. I also found the product in Paris, where I will probably have to go to find it again."
34926,0,"i bought this for its spf b/c if i try to put other stuff on my face at the beach, it burns like napalm & i'm practically screaming. so it isnt waterproof, which is a shame.it does do a little bit of mattifying, way more than the derma dr product (which does literally nothing), but i think that when your pores want to get ride of their oil, they are going to, & nothing's going to stop them. & is it healthy to stop them?...using those little rice papers seems to me to be the best solution, even tho they're a pain in the neck (to me). rice papers work, w/o messing up the make up.this stuff is really great sunblock, tho!i'm italian, but a pale-faced sort, until a few days down at the shore, sunning on the beach, so i dont need high-powered sunblock ever, but do need something small, like 8-20. this stuff works well, doesnt bug my complexion either. dermalogica makes good products for my hyper-sensitive, combination-type skin because it never ever breaks me out."
99449,1,"I purchased this perfume while searching for something professional, yet feminine, to wear to work. What I ended up with is a pleasant floral/musk fragrance that I receive many compliments on, and a pretty bottle that looks nice on my dresser.The fragrance starts out with a spicy scent of citrus and ginger with a sweeter jasmine and vanilla undertone. After about twenty to thirty minutes, the scent becomes more musky, like sandalwood, but still retaining the pleasant, light floral scent underneath. The overall fragrance lasts for a full work day, and I often receive compliments on the fragrance even late in the afternoon or early evening, after approximately ten to twelve hours of wear.This is one of my favorite perfumes, at least partly because of what it is NOT: Armani Code for women is never overly sweet and flowery, edibly fruit-scented, nor beach and ocean-ish. Instead, it is a pleasant mix of musk and feminity that pairs well with my long working day. Although the Armani advertisements I have seen tend to bill this item as ultra-sexy, femme fatale material, I generally use this scent as ""work"" perfume rather than ""date"" perfume.Also, if you like to display your perfume bottles (as I do), the bottle has a curvy shape with a nice pattern and an unusual purple color."
183617,1,"My last hair dryer was a Conair 1875 watt dryer which made my hair look nice, but took absolutely forever to dry. I have pretty thick hair, and it would take AT LEAST 40 minutes to dry the majority of my hair. I'm not a morning person in any way, shape or form, and there's no way I can afford an extra 40-60 minutes just to dry my hair. That being said, I end up going out in the cold winter weather with a partially wet head.Well today has been the coldest day of the year, and I have to say, I was so thrilled that this new dryer came in the mail yesterday. Honestly, I was extremely skeptical when I saw the size of the nozzle, since it is much smaller than the one I was previously using. I was shocked when my hair was dry in about 13 minutes! I did not find the dryer that heavy at all. In fact, it felt the same as my old dryer, so no complaints there. It does have some weight to it, but nothing unmanageable, and it would not deter me from using it in the least. As other reviews mentioned, the only downside is that my hair did get tangled from all the hair blowing around, but if I'm going to be brushing it anyway, this wasn't a problem either.The results were great. No frizz, very few fly-aways, and sleek hair in less time. This is a keeper for me, and I won't be going back to any other dryer."
27270,2,"Ordered 2 bottles of Bvlgari Omnia parfum from TUCCINI for Christmas, arrived late.One box had empty bottle in box, Tuccini said I had returned a used empty bottle, not so. Later returned second bottle, did not smell right, bad product, they said I couldn't open a box and try parfume then say I did not like the smell. How can you know what it smells like if you can't try it. Really did not smell like the ones you find in department stores.If the price seems too good to be true it probable is.Will continue to order from AMAZON, they are a great company, they made things right."
231468,0,This product controls the frizz fairly well but has a drying effect on my very coarse thick hair. Jury is still out as to whether or not I will use it again.

56200,2,"I truly enjoy this parfum, I have purchased this item many times through Amazon.com until now the product has always been what I have ordered until this current order. The seller ""Pretty Princess"" DID NOT SEND what I ordered, they subsistuted my order without informing me of the change, they are unavailable for emails and never responded to my repeated requests for a review of my order so I could receive what I ordered. Amazon issued a credit to me and I am very happy with this. This is an outstanding product and will be ordering it again but not from this seller."
81958,0,"I like the concept of a hair perfume. My hair can only tolerate being washed every other day, but I still want fresh hair and thought this item would work. I'm sorry to say that it's too sweet for me. I tried many tricks to tone down the scent, from spraying into my hands and then applying to hair to blotting with a towel after spritzing my hair. That sickening sweet smell was still there. I gave it to my sister, who seems to like it, so I have not wasted money. I'm glad it worked for others, but it was just not for me.P.S. I tried to edit my review and change the number of stars from 3 to 2, but it won't allow me."
74703,0,"This is a BIG fragrance with lot-o-note. It's well-rounded, well-blended and full of depth & character. A classic-type of perfume for a classy lady. It's on the sweet side due to all the white florals. Very nice if you like that kind of thing. I prefer my orientals spicier, so not my thing.Boucheron is a high quality perfume. If you like Elizabeth Taylor frags and are ready to step it up a notch, put this on your test list. Just my 2 cents."
46312,2,"I bought a bar of this soap to bump up my order total to qualify for Free Super Saver Shipping. I like Grapefruit scented stuff and I like Red Currant scented stuff. I do not, however, like soap that smells like vomit and cheap perfume. I could smell the soap through the package, but I didn't know what I could have ordered that would smell so bad until I opened the box. Seriously, it smells like puke. I couldn't even warrant tucking it in as part of someone's Christmas present. I had to throw it away. I'm very thrifty, but this nasty little soap* defeated my frugal sensibilities. Nasty. I can't imagine putting this on my skin, but at least I got my Free Shipping...*The bar of soap is pretty tiny."
58704,2,"I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... Save your money, trust me! I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! What a bunch of crap...... BTW - check out *all* the reviews on this product, they listed it in several places here - make sure you go see all the reviews (because there are a lot of them and they will help you make a good decision!)"
141544,1,"I like it, I love it but for this time I am disappointed, I got it on Amazon but transportation company does not take toilette Spray, so, what can I do it is still in transportation compani's store..... I feel disapointed"
109604,0,"First let me say something. People STOP reviewing Amazon. When you leave specific Product reviews, it is not an opportunity to whine about Amazon, shipping times, wrong item etc. No one gives a crap about that stuff, we are reading about PRODUCTS, since Product reviews are FOR PRODUCTS.Now that cleared up lets move on... Le Male has been around for almost 2 decades and its been my goto fragrance since it was released. It recently has been gaining a lot of popularity but before it was popular it was difficult to find and I was one of the very few that wore it regularly. Im glad it was not discontinued and has finally gained its long over due recognition... I suppose it was simply ahead of its time. Its definitely unique and not for just anyone."
104086,1,"I have been using this cologne for 25 years and never met a woman that didn't love it. The last 3.4 bottle I bought was for $40, I'm having trouble understanding why it's now $189. It's always been my fragrance and I hate to change but I will seriously need to consider that price tag. It's a shame, but maybe the upside is not every guy will be wearing it."
72216,1,"Here's me after blow drying my long hair with my old Conair 1875 Lite (bought circa 1999 around $10): ""Why's my hair always so frizzy and looks so dry and fluffy?""Here's me after blow drying my long hair with the Super Solano 1875 Professional Dryer (bought 2012 around $130): ""Whoa....have we met?""In a nutshell, it cut my drying time in half, despite the fact I was fussing with my sectioning clips, it dried very quickly. My hair came out shiny and smooth and laid beautifully. The only disadvantage is that it is a little heavier than what I'm used to but I am sure I'll acclimate to it. Plus the longer nozzle will take adjusting. All minor. A bit expensive but I've been told by my hairdresser that if you want a good hair dryer, you should be prepared to spend around the $100+ mark. But I love the way my hair looks so I think it's worth it. Also, in the past I would put some Moroccan oil before and after styling as my hair felt so dry. With the Super Solano, I only had to use the oil before as it looked soft and shiny after styling.Pity I didn't get it on Amazon taking advantage of some great prices, but I wanted to talk to someone in the industry so I forked out to a local business and I'm glad for them to have the $$ given the guidance they gave me. But thought I'd write the review to help anyone who's considering this product."
224697,0,"I got this yesterday, and while at first I was overjoyed, I realized that it doesn't seem to protect the hair in any way. While it irons my hair even better than my old straightener, especially when wet, both my mom and a friend agree that it seems to be damaging my hair, and it gets so burned you can smell it. Definitely use a heat protectant."
226657,2,This product rubs off of your skin and gets on to your clothing (or any other fabric -- like a chair or a car interior) and stains the fabric. Not recommended.
187950,1,"I like this curling iron its works good and is not too expensive. Con is that I've had a few of them, after about a year or so its seems the sping lever breaks but I guess you get waht you pay for. Otherwise I def recommend this. It works great and has an on the go cover for when its still hot."
175332,1,"In a time when the cosmetic industry is flooding us with so called ""natural"" products, this one stands out and is truly safe. It feels great going on and I love the results well enough to have signed up for the regular shipments of this product. I alternate the Supreme Polypeptide cream with the Pumpkin Renew cream. If you like to use multiple products at one time, then feel safe in doing so with this line of skin care.

36813,0,"Dark, heavy, smoky & sexy are all apt descriptions for Absolu. ""You can start the party now!""The lily in the opening gives the impression that Absolu might be another one of those monster white floral fragrances. It's not. Well, not entirely. The lily in this is not agreeable to me - too heavy, too sweet, too cloying, too Donna Karan Gold. Urgh!!Thankfully, the white floral power doesn't last more than 15 minutes on me. Then it heads straight for Cartier Must & Dragon Kiss territory. I want to love Absolu but life's too short to risk a headache during a white flower power opening. Sadly, this one goes up for swap."
163821,0,"I bought this night-creme seeking a moisturizer similar to their carrot nutritive lotion, which I love. However, to my disappointment, I found it very heavy and greasy like a salve, not at all what my troubled complexion needs at night. Instead I just use the carrot lotion on my face, which seems to work great."
155951,1,"This towel is amazing. It is very absorbing, cleans easily, and is the perfect size for use in the kitchen to handle emergencies. I will buy this product again."
107989,0,It's a good mirror but the only thing I wish it was tilt. Obviously you can tilt the entire piece but I wish the mirror itself would tilt. A little annoying that it doesn't - hence my 3 star rating.

222573,0,"I was interested in the Suki line because it is organic. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the products. I ordered the balanceing kit to get samples of the products in which I was interested.The first dissapointment was with the packaging. All of the products were packaged in small, tear-open pouches. I understand that this may be an environmentally friendly package, but I find them to be very messy. The description for this kit indicates that the kit is great for travel and implies that several applications of each product are included. However, once these pouches are opened, lotions seep out and cleansing clays dry up.The foaming cleanser does not foam at all. I did not feel as if it really cleaned my skin. In fact, it felt a little oily. Nor did I feel that the balancing toner deeply cleaned my pores. The balancing day lotion and facial moisturizer are very thin. I don't believe moisturizers have to be thick to be effective, so this is not really a complaint. However, I don't think they worked any better than other, cheaper moisturizers I have used. Finally, the transformative cleansing clay was fine, but again, was not spectacular.All of the products had very nice scents, and the fact that they are organic is nice. However, overall I was not that impressed with the products and will continue searching."
54536,2,This product does not work as it says it would. Makes hair hard and not easy to manage. I would not buy this product again.
53900,0,These curlers are alright. They heat up fine and curl good but the clips that are provided don't hold my hair. They need to improve those. But other than that they work fine.
182554,0,"Using this product made me more prone to break outs. If I use it for two days in a row it's Zit City on my nose and forehead, it seemed to increase the amount of oil. Oddly, this Oil Control product is not oil free. If I alternate daily with an oil free face wash that stopped the breakouts, but that left me wondering why I should use the Nivea Oil Control at all.All skin care products are subjective and need to match your skin - I don't know why, but this product just didn't work for me."
188657,0,i think it cleans up well..but frequent washes have resulted in hair fall...but i think its because of the included conditioner..and its chemicals....

150593,0,"Burberry Brit smells wonderful, like a spicy, sophisticated vanilla. However, this perfume gives me a horrible migraine every single time I use it. So be warned, if you're sensitive to migraines or headaches, just be aware that this may be irritating to you."
88142,2,"I purchased this expensive product with the belief that it would keep African-American hair streighter during and after blow-drying. Wrong.The product caused my hair to become brittle, and breaking. I will not use it again, and I am not sure how to send it back. In this economy, I lost more money that I needed to."
188124,2,"I was deeply disappointed with this product. It is definitely not the Bumble and Bumble from my salon. At first it simply seemed watery, no where near as thick as the real product. I had some of the original left and compared, definitely not the same viscosity. I attributed that to first use, but it did not improve. Second, I noticed that rather than moisturizing like the real product, it seemed to have a drying, stripping impact. And the smell was off, couldn't quite place it until I picked up some baby shampoo. It smells remarkably like Johnson and Johnson dimestore brand. This product is a rip off. The best I can tell, they are bottling some cheaper brand name, watering it down and selling it at full price. I won't be purchasing from this vendor again."
42562,2,"I've bought this cologne before and really liked it, but the most recent sample I bought from the Perfume Emporium smelled like some cheap no name brand. I don't no if my sample was an old bottle that was past it's shelf life or it was watered down, it may have been in the right container but it wasn't the same cologne."
141255,1,"I recently had my blond eyebrows dyed at the salon for the very first time and was extremely pleased that I didn't have to draw them on any more! I had no idea you could do that! It occurred to me that I might be able to do this at home, so I searched Amazon and behold: there IS a product for that. I have extremely fair skin and I bought the medium brown. It dyed my eyebrows the perfect shade in 2 minutes and didn't stain my skin (after washing them really well and using toner). I've been sporting my new brows for 2 weeks now and the color has really stayed. I love it. I'll never draw my eyebrows on again!"

163733,0,I was so excited to try this out but I don't feel like it had much affect on my skin. I did notice my skin glowed more but as far as acne goes it did not help out with that
140012,0,"I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks! I only used it once a day and occassionally a second time at night. Way too expensive for how long it lasts."

198689,0,"I bought this for my teen daughter because I have heard and read so many rave reviews about it. While it works well enough, I don't think it works that much better than the $25.00 ones we already owned. It heats up quickly and does straighten hair, but again, I and my daughter did not find that it straightened hair better and did not find it worth the extra expense."
590,2,"This thing looks good in the pictures, but I immediately regret only reading the first few reviews. The negative reviews are 100% correct. I had this thing delivered on 2/16/12, and I threw it away yesterday (3/4/12), as it was cracked, peeled, and starting to mold. Do Not Buy this item."
25397,0,This cologne Diesel Zero Plus was a little on the powdery side. This is something that's just not for me.
49796,2,If you naturally have light hair stay away from this one unless you want it to end up an other-worldly fuscia pink! Also this product has the amazing ability to stain porcelain sinks!
211977,0,I was disappointed because it was so small. I guess I should have known because it said 0.16. Just can't visualize that size. My own fault.
103515,0,"PROS: I am trying to go natural with all of the products that I use on my body and so the fact that this cleansing bar has two simple ingredients is pretty great. It was even non-irritating in more intimate areas, so the gentleness is top of the line. Also, it lasted a pretty long itme.CONS: Several things annoyed me. 1.Ideally I would like to enjoy the scent of my soap, but I'm willing to take a hit on this for the sake of being natural. But this not only fails to provide a nice scent, but it actually provides an irksome scent. (note: there are natural soaps with a nice scent so this trade off is unnecessary) 2. This soap is MESSY. For example, if I used the soap for a quick face wash, there would be yellow gunk all over my sink and faucet. 3. It is not great for shaving. My legs would be kind of dry after shaving with this soap and I normally shave with soap."
234191,0,I was tired of using the traditional remover products which are so ineffective. This product is definitely beats the traditional product but it still took me 2 mitts to get it all off from my toe nails. I dont think it will work out for me price wise.
223300,2,"I have used this for about a month now. I have fine color-treated curls. I found the product to be ok at first, but it has dried my hair out more than I would have expected. It does make for nicely defined curls until the product dries and you touch your hair. Dry and frizzy is the result of touching. I was looking for something which would define my curls and not dry the out. This is not the product."
218921,0,"I love this companies other products, but I am not a fan of this mascara.Something in this product reacts badly with me and makes my eyes turn red and water! I was very disappointed because I figured a ""natural"" mascara would be easier on the eyes and I typically do not have this problem with other brands."
148494,0,"I was very happy with the rapidity of the delivery and the product works just fine, but was disappointed that the rollers were so small. Apparently, my idea of jumbo and the manufacturer's idea are different. If you have short hair, this is ideal, but for longer hair, it makes the curl too tight, hence the need for JUMBO rollers. With this said, the product itself is fine and it is indeed small enough to through in your luggage without taking up heaps of room. If you are looking for rollers that will give hair below your shoulders a nice bounce, these rollers are to small to do the job."
168177,1,"I thought this would have a more nude tone but it is pink. More like blush than naked, but I love it regardless!"

78604,2,"My wife bought this for me and when it came in, we knew we had a problem. The UPC stickers were all removed from the box and covered up by this phony companies own. The Label on the bottom of the bottle was also removed. It smells like a fart that is being masked by cheap cologne. I DO NOT recommend buying this product. Save yourself some grief and pay a little more and get the real deal."
138138,2,"I just found out they test on animals, my money (vote to promote this) is not going to that! I now quickly Google any product, why should they do this if it's ""Natural"" supposedly? We don't live in the stone ages, it is so barbaric and wrong!"
191148,0,"Like the other Avon makeup I bought, this turns your face orange. It doesn't even cover up any blemishes. What is the point of putting on makeup if all your flaws show through the orange glow?????"
178582,0,This is a great product for my bald head and other things exposed to the sun. It works for a few times then inevibly the stick breaks off in the tube. Probably from the heat of the beach. also any sand will jam the raising and lower mechanism keeping the product from even working. Clarins is really good stuff - just get the regular 30 in a tube and skip the complex technology. Not rugged enough for hot beach environment.
218359,2,"I watched the infomercial on TV and really bought into the hype. I just dished out $28 (during our bad economy) hoping to found something worthwhile. I have used this for a month and each time I use it, my hair is frizzier and ""dirty-looking"" than usual. I was hoping for smooth, shiny hair like they advertised. I think i have better luck with my normal organic shampoo mixed with natural oils. Will not repurchase."
60526,0,The Elchim 1800 R/B hairdryer performs great. I should know because I've had 4 of them. I keep buying them on average 1/18mos. This IS NOT good. The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I'm thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims. The cord is NOT round as stated in some other reviews. It is the flat type. Wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation.
54043,0,"I tried these rollers for the first time yesterday and was really disappointed in the instructions and handling the rollers. I would have to wear gloves to use the rollers if I do not want to burn my fingers. When I finally got the rollers in the hair the next problem were the clips. There are no instructions how to attach the clips to the rollers. Up, down, sideways....nothing. After minutes of trying different ways I finally got the mission accomplished but felt very disappointed. The one good thing that comes out of using these rollers was actually nice non frizzy hair with very gentle curls. For the first time in months my hair looked great, it was just very difficult getting there :-("
138755,1,"The Conair I've had since the dawn of time finally died on me. Decided to step it up a bit and gave this a try and it's awesome! heats up super fast, holds great and makes great waves/curls.

41453,2,"The product does its job of straightening and shine, but I am thinking of returning this product. I lost lot of hair in the first use and am scared of using it any more. I have thin, long wavy-curly hair, May be its just my hair type, but just wanted to let you all know."

126512,1,"I bought this 2-3 years ago when my cheap vidal iron poofed up and died within 8 months. If you do not want to spend a ton of money but want a straighter that is much better than conair, vidal and such, this is the one to get. I almost bought the smaller ceramic one but thought that maybe straighteners did not last so long and did not want to spend the extra money. However, this one works way better than my old one and it was actually cheaper!!! If it breaks I will definitely buy the hot tools ceramic large one. Right now I am seriously considering getting the 3/4 inch one so I can try the curling technique :) This is my first experience with hot tools and so far it is a great product!!! I just ordered a hair dryer, triple barrel waver and, ribbon curling iron because of how satisfied I am with this product!!!"
21148,2,"I purchased a nail polish from Zoya's website several months ago. I tested it on just one finger (my thumb nail), it was a tiny bit clumpy, I just figured it needed to be shaken more next time before using it. I sealed up the bottle and put it with the rest of the polish I have.Fast forward to this past weekend, I tried using the same polish and this time it was EXTREMELY chunky. It didn't go on well at all and looked horrible. I shook it like crazy and tried it on another finger, and it's still awful.so, I e-mailed Zoya through their ""contact us"" link on the webpage and waited patiently for a response. Today, they tell me to get rejuvenating drops and try using that, that I obviously didn't put the cover on tight enough (cause clearly I have no idea how to close a nail polish bottle?). After expressing my disappointment in their awful customer service (and hence giving them yet another chance to make it right with me), the woman forwarded my e-mail to her supervisor who then told me that I'm basically out of luck cause I didn't report a 'flaw' in the first ten days.Skip this product all together, it's not as great as it's price tag says it should be, I'd rather have formaldehyde on my nails and deal with a company that stands behind their products 100%."
14494,2,I have a busy nail salon in WI...this nail dryer did a good job while it lasted. However the bushings went bad and it sound like a tank...only had it for about 7 months and I can no longer use it on clients.
123251,2,"This eyeliner isn't any different from your local drugstore eyeliner. It pulled on my lash line during application. I'm not completely satisfied but if all you're looking for is a BASIC eyeliner then this is for you (along with all the other ones at your local drugstore). It also dispenses quickly and doesn't seem like it'll last very long.One up point for the stars? It doesn't smudge throughout the day (but again, neither does all my other eyeliners)."
189339,2,"This henna is of very poor quality, it's gritty, has twigs in it but the worst of all, has no dye release - no change in color was observed at all after 2 hours. I would be wary of premixed hennas - henna and indigo has different dye release times so they need to be mixed separately.Don't waste your time or money. Find good quality henna."

113311,0,"I was very curious to try this, and got it for Xmas. It blows a lot of intense heat, at first I was overwhelmed. My drying time is decreased, yes, but I have to be just as careful to control frizz as I did with my old $14 dryer by Conair. My hair is very curly and about medium weight. I do wish there was at least one more level of heat control. High is very high, and low is very low. I am still in search of my dream hair dryer...."

149512,2,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this product. I have always loved the original version of this lotion in the white bottle with BLUE trim. It goes on so smoothly and has a really nice, light, fresh scent. Unfortunately it was discontinued and I haven't been able to find it anywhere until I searched one day and found it listed on Amazon. Since the photo clearly showed the white bottle with blue trim - the exact same bottle of the product I love - and the seller is called ""closeouts&discontinueds;"", I figured this had to be the right item, so I purchased the two that were left in stock immediately.Sadly, when the order arrived, I opened the box to find two bottles of the newer product - a white bottle with RED trim - and when I tried the lotion, it had a bland, almost chemical smell to it (supposedly ""fragrance free""). In short, this is NOT the item that was advertised, and although they may be described similarly, they are not the same product. I ended up being stuck with two bottles of crappy smelling lotion that I could have gotten at the drug store, except I paid more than twice what they cost in the drug store. So lame. If you're looking for the lotion pictured in the product photo on this page, don't buy it here - you won't get it."

230899,2,A complete waste of money. I still have all my stretch marks
233142,1,Love the color. It goes with everything. Has a nice shine and golden glow. Have used it for years and will continue.
180256,0,"The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color"
37172,2,This is more of a makeup brush than a proper neck duster. I'll be dumping this and getting the real deal next time.
131361,0,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend. I found that it was very messy to use and took very long to warm in the microwave. I would not recommend this. Go to the salon, it's much easier"
223105,1,I don't like many perfumes but this one is so soft and gentle. It smells great. This is a really good price for such a big bottle.
76189,0,"I wanted to like this product!! I'd read so many consistently good reviews about this serum that I thought it would be a sure-fire winner. The only negatives I'd read were that the packaging was poorly designed. In the end, I think it probably IS a decent product, but the INCREDIBLY poor design of the packaging outweighs the benefits of the serum. Also, the bottle is just too small, especially for the cost. I probably won't buy this again."
34458,2,"I absolutely love the design of this dryer. I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...it straightens and smooths without frying it) and when I travel, I have to lug it with me. This one would fit in a suitcase. HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn't dry the sides and bottom portion of hair. Also, this dryer is sooooo loud! I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter. Wish someone would design a hard hat bonnet style dryer that collapses but drys the entire head, not just the top! Just didn't work for me...I had to send it back :("
20427,2,"the nivea Nivea for Men Skin Essentials Protective Lotion is a comparable product thats less than half the price .All the active ingredients listed in this product are just UVA and UVB protective ingredeints . The nivea product i recommend above his most of the same ingredients and much more . In terms of my research based on the ingredients , the nivea product is cheaper and better .Also , they feel the same on the skin for me.Nivea for Men Skin Essentials Protective Lotion, SPF 15, Normal to Dry Skin, 2.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)"
65007,1,This purchase is a replacement for rollers for the Caruso Molecular Stream system. I've used this system for years.The foam deteriorates hence the need to replace rollers periodically. Hair has stayed healthy without using the hot curling iron.
11213,0,Received product and not as pictured. Packaging was completely different. The clips in the picture look larger and mine did not come with the red clips. Kinda disappointing as I mostly wanted the red ones. But for $5 not a bad price and I will still use them.
17788,0,"The first thing I noticed about the shampoo was the wonderful fresh scent. But I felt the shampoo left my hair feeling slightly heavy and dirty by the end of the day. My hair tends to be very oily, so possibly the oily hair version would have suited me better than the normal version. This shampoo sells for a very reasonable price and I'd probably recommend it to my """"non-oily haired"""" friends."
11158,1,"Knowing is the perfect name for this classy scent. It's got crisp clean top notes, but mellows out to a very lingering sensual fragrance.A little Knowing goes a long way. It's definitely not for daytime, but as an evening fragrance, it's perfect. Though it's pricey, a bottle will last you longer than many other scents. In fact, the lotion alone, lingers on the skin for hours.This is Estee Lauders best scent in the evening line of fragrances, and on the right woman, it's simply unforgettable."
216329,0,"I bought this a my local drug store because it was cheap and the liner pencils just don't work for me. I've been using this for about 3 months now, but only because it's the only thing I own at the moment. I found this product to be effective, but it's hard to remove and goes on really thick. Also, if it gets on your skin or you make a mistake, it's really hard to get off. When applied, it doesn't look natural at all. It looks like I've caked on some black stuff above my eyes and it's not attractive. Another con is that the bottle itself gets very messy around the rim of the container. Grr..However, it is very waterproof and stays on all day. (if you don't mess with it) Also, it doesn't look like it but there's a lot of product in there! It's lasted for a long time. Still, I would invest in a better product."
159346,0,I use this product for problems with Dandruff. Unfortunately the nozzle of the bottle is changed and due to this I am having problems in uniformly applying the liquid on the scalp.
50367,2,"This might work for some, but not my hair. I have thick hair that holds onto moisture (shoulder length that takes 1 hour to blow dry) and the rollers left my locks a complete mess. No curls, no shine-just a frizzy mess. I experimented with the amount of time I left the rollers on the steamer, but nothing worked for me. I was hoping that these would work because I am concerned about heat and damage, but returned these and bought the BaByliss Professional 30 Nano Titanium Hairsetter Roller Set."
96045,2,Worn the 'scent' three times now with no noticeable effects on the opposite sex at all. Beginning to think its a dud.
89519,2,"I wrote a review for another product, eye shadow and gave it one star. The review has been changed to 3 stars by someone. Why ask for a review if you (Amazon) change it ?For what it's worth- I ordered 10 of L'Oreal eye pencil and received 1. I paid an exorbitant postage and handling fee for one (1) pencil. Where are the other nine (9) pencils?Does anybody read these things?"
179572,0,I work with a woman who bought this cologne for her husband and said it was the best thing she smelled since I farted..haha...just kidding. She did say that she loves the smell of the cologne. I purchased it off of Amazon and I was not crazy about it and my wife wasnt either. I sold it on ebay to try and get my money back.
102641,0,"I went solely by reviews that said people liked this fragrance as much or more than Britney Spears Curious perfume; I think is is best to try it in a store first. I really like Curious, but found Fantasy to be very ""young"". In fact, I donated it for a prize at work and the organizer's 14 year old daughter told her she wanted it right away."
145828,2,"This dryer is heavy and loud, I would not recommend it to anybody. I was in a hurry for a new dryer so I bought it at retail store for 59.00. Sooooo not worth it. AND, the air is not hot at all. It blows cool air on the hot setting. Also, the buttons on the side turn the dryer off while drying. They were put in an awkward spot. HATE IT! And no, I'm not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something. And this, I feel that everyone should know so they don't waste their money like I did."
39218,1,The best fragrance for women. I had a problem ordering. I chose a 3.4 oz and they delivered me a 1.7. They refunded me for the mistake. I still don't know which one to select. Don't get driven by the price/oz/EDP/EDP
50203,0,"This mirror is not a bad deal economically. But I'd pay a few dollars more to have a real handle. It's frustrating to hold because it bends, and you have to brace your thumb against the backside when using it."
105170,1,I bought this prior to my double knee replacements for added safety and peace of mind. Perfect fit for tub. Can be machine washed which was done yesterday without problems.
94712,1,"First of all this product has the most wonderful smell. Plus, it makes my hair feel so soft without a waxy feel. I think it actually makes my hair easier to style - and - my hair feels really healthy."
186596,2,"The size of the case is advertised as being 24 x 10 x 10. The case I received is 14 x 10.5 x 8.5. The model number in the description is SHANY044, but the model number of the case I received is SHANY005. However the UPC codes do match. I know of at least one other reviewer who had the same problem.Beware! They need to fix the description so that it matches the product!"
189364,2,"I just received the product, it was fast, but there is no plastic wrap, and the box seems to be opened before (there is some dirt on the bottle too)also the bottle is somehow broken, no leaking. I guess I will not return it just because it is a lot of trouble"
120384,2,"I was very excited, there were so many positive reviews, and I applied it for the first time today but OMG it made my poors look huge, and brought out some wrinkles I did not know I had. Another thing I was hoping for was no breaking me out, but it did, in fact in like three hours I had a good size pimple formed up by my mouth, very sad...I guess I will keep looking."
79591,1,Everything arrived on time and in good condition. I would order this product again in the future. I would also recommend this item to others.
84957,2,"Didn't think it worked for me at all. Did not take long to get to me at all. Would recommend this for people to try, just didn't work for me."
114100,0,"Service on this product was excellent! Quick shipment. However, the actual product is not what I had hoped. It is very, very noisy and limits where in the house I can use the hair dryer so as not to interrupt other family member activities."
214305,0,"I bought this in hope, but it's not for me. I have thick and coarse hair. Also, my hair is long, wavy, and voluminous. I have a lot of hair!!! I watched on youtube the instructional video on how to do the whole process, and I did everything, but it only left my hair as the same thing as it was. Maybe it didn't work well because I bought the sweet almond mint , and about the conditioner it's writen ""a universal cleasing conditioner beneficial for all hair types. Works exceptionally well on fine to medium hair"" Then, the styling creme is for the same kind of hair as the conditioner!!!!!!!Also, I saw the wen instructional dvd styling creme video on youtube, but Chaz Dean said that Wen conditioner adds ""body"" to your hair. Well, that's not my case!I do NOT need more ""body"". There are more types of conditioners/styling cremes that work differently acording to your hair type, so BE CAREFUL!(sweet almond mint, tea tree, cucumber aloe, lavander, fig)- the last one it says ""wonderful for medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethic hair. works exceptionally on dry,dehydrated,color-treated, damaged hair"". Maybe, the FIG condioner and creme would have been better for me...The styling creme is OK, but it didn't show any amazing results to spend so much money. My previous creme does the same thing and it's cheaper. Maybe, one day I can buy the FIG and see."
144693,0,"I used this product and love it. When my cousin told me that some of olay products contains ingredients that are deemed as ""cancer causing in animal"" and organ toxicity etc.... according to skin deep web site. I google those ingredients and found that four ingredients cyclopentasiloxane(first ingredient), Ethyparaben, propylparaben and methylparaben(actually banned in Europe to be used in skin product) are the bad ingredient. I am now totally torned as I love it on my skin and concerned that it might be the causes for my fribromygia. So, I hope Olay will remove these ingredients and produce some product that are green and non-toxic."
191562,0,"I bought this for Christmas for my daughter. It was inexpensive which was good since she is only 5. It seems to be pretty sturdy, but not quite as heavily weighted as I thought it should be on the bottom to insure it doesn't flip over. It seems to swivel satifactorily. I wished there were other finish options because the chrome cheapens the look. Good buy for the money."
32119,1,"I am a 47 yr old woman. I've been using this night cream for approx. 2 yrs now and really enjoy the results! As soon as I apply I can feel my skin tighten and to be honest I do not have any wrinkles - YET! ;o) I love ROC products, the only product of theirs I was not happy with was the eye correction cream...it was very strong so I have been using Olay eye serum and really like it. I use to have this line between eyebrows and fine lines on forehead, and as soon as I started using ROC I noticed that they disappeared...Had to keep looking at myself in the mirror because I couldn't beleive it. I really was ready to begin Botox but no!...no Botox required as of YET! Thank you ROC!!!!!"
170948,2,"I LOVE the color of Flip Flop Fantasy (neon orangey-pink). Unfortunately the nail polish is really watery, goes on streaky (needs 3 coats of color), dries with a matte finish, and chips within 2-3 days, even with top and bottom coats. I tried it once on my toes and once on my hands and I had the same experience both times. As much as I love the color, I doubt I will try it again- not worth the effort because it doesn't last."
168143,0,Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty. Basically anything china glaze is pretty awesome.
168047,0,"This product is good, I just was not as satisfied with the color as I would have liked. But the product was shipped fast and it is of good quality."
144535,1,"this feels wonderful when applied. so light u almost don't know it's there, with just the right creaminess. i use this at the very end, after microdermabrasion & peel kit. it's very smoothing & cooling. no oily residue."
4026,2,This cologne does not smell like the 20 other bottles of this cologne I have owned in the past? I don't know if it is old or got heated some way prior to delivery. I am disappointed in the scent.
5526,2,"For the first two weeks of diligent use, my acne became worse. However, I continued using it because what a lot of acne medications do first is bring all impurities to the surface as part of ridding your acne. My skin did improve, but by the time the bottles were nearly empty and six weeks had gone by, my skin was exactly the same as when I started the system. This product didn't do anything for me except waste my time. Right now, I am trying Proactiv, and just by comparing both system's ingredients I have a feeling that their ""Better than Proactiv"" statement is false. I will write my review for Proactiv within the next few weeks."
62636,0,"This is a delicious fragrance but it stays on skin for a short time, unfortunately.After 2 or 3 hours it desapears........"
109458,2,"I just received my shipment of ZINO Davidoff with great anticipation of my favorite Fragrance , what a let down when I opened it and used it for the first time. Nothing like the original that I was accustomed to. It wasn't even close! Would not recommend this if you have had the original. I really don't think that they are making the original, just got my hopes up."
104968,1,"This is a unique fragrance and should be treated as such. Depending on which version you have(it has been reformulated a couple of times since its original release), it may have more or less of that classic oil, rubber note that makes this fragrance so daring. It is one of the most unique EDT's out of the 60+ I own. Longevity and projection are awesome, expect to get noticed with this one. Now whether this is a good thing or a bad one depends one the person, this is a very much love or hate fragrance. Women may love the floral notes and be intrigued by the tar, or be completely turned off by what she thinks is mechanics oil and flowers. My girlfriend is on the latter end of this opinion. Whether your love it or hate it you cannot deny it's attitude to challenge the industry. I happen to enjoy it in small doses, but would much rather enjoy it's flankers 32 and summer."
56822,0,"Borghese mud mask is good deep cleansing product. but work just okay with my skin.I have combination skin type, oily in T zone and dry in U zone. I feel little bit dry after used the mask.So, I guess this product might good for oily skin people."
239544,1,This was a gift. The person we gave it to really liked it. One could say it stinks but in a good way.
220517,2,The heel smoother does just an okay job. I was disappointed.
230166,0,"I liked the way this shampoo smelled. It left my hair feeling very clean and light. However, it didn't really do anything for my fine, limp hair. Actually, I didn't expect it to do anything for my lifeless hair. Since it was made for fine, limp hair, I thought it might do something, but no. However, overall, I liked the product a lot."
13417,0,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love the nail polish. Not to mention - the price cannot be beat! It was of the quality I expected BUT it was different than the one I had at home. I had bought it at the nail salon and fell in love with it. It goes on very sheer with a nice shimmer and is great for the summer, however, the one I had at home is not as pink as the one I ordered. So, if you're looking for a color that you already have don't be surprised if the one you order on line is a bit different. I have to say though, for the price, the slight difference in color is not a big deal."
218240,1,"I'm normally not a huge vanilla fan as so many smell cheap to me. This perfume is so different. It smells sweet but not in a tacky artificial way. I don't smell the perfume on me after a while but I'm constantly being asked what I'm wearing. This, in my opinion, actually smells better once it been sprayed on which isn't always the case."
84153,1,Wondeful warm vanilla scent. I've tried more expensive shower gels that were nowhere as good as this one. Absolutely love it!
139429,0,"I wanted gigantic huge waves, it said this was jumbo and that's about the biggest you can go but the barrels were small and i didn't like the waves. I mean it was pretty but not on me, that isn't the style i wanted and each wave is about 1 and a half inches in length. More like a perm i thought. It does work nicely though, heats up in 30 seconds and is super easy to store. Not all bad, just small barrels."
200789,2,"I really like the capacity to dry and curl and having two sizes of brushes is a bonus. Having the cool setting is very nice. The high setting gets really hot and so does the brush area. I was disappointed the last time I took the brush dryer with me on a trip. The small tip that snaps the brush into place broke off. I have carpeted floor in my bath and bedroom, so if the dryer was dropped it dropped onto a carpeted floor. Anyway, I have had this dryer less than a year. Not sure if this is a recurring problem with other users. I have duct taped the brush cylinder to the dryer but the metal areas get too hot for the tape to adhere. I am now looking to replace the dryer and not sure what to go to."
73934,0,"I got this product because I'd heard it would be great for dry hair. Having recently gone blonder, my hair was a little dry & damaged, so I thought this would help. It's not for my hair type -- it left it feeling very waxy & unpleasant. Even rinsing it repeatedly for an extended period of time, it just didn't feel or look good. I have fine, relatively straight hair, so I just want to pass on that it may not be for you if you have similar hair."
38309,0,"And that's not terrible, but Amazon really needs to update their product listing to indicate that it may come with either one.Otherwise, I like this kit, have purchased it in the past, and probably will again sometime in the future. The gloves are super nice (love the bee design on them!), the shea butter hand creme is great and very effective for damaged skin (I know some people don't like the smell of this creme, but I'm not one of them!), the hand lotion is very nice, and probably the cuticle cream is too (I rarely use it)."
184727,2,"Ok, so it makes your skin feel soft, but not any softer than baby oil but unlike baby oil which comes in lovely scents, this smells a lot like mosquito repellent. It's no wonder it's known to repel them!"
68809,1,Very good I used it for 40 years. Every Person says how good it smells and wants to know where I get the product
218336,0,"So I saw the informercial and instantly I was intrigued. I have very curly hair and fine to boot (not the most manageable). Following the directions with dreams of awesome hair, I only ended up being disappointed as it left my hair very greasy. The only reason I gave this product stars was because when I used it on my dog, her hair comes out so soft and fluffy. I guess for curly girls like myself there is no real magical product...If you do know of any (and styling tips) do respond to this comment... or if I am doing something wrong with the product advice would be useful."
47111,1,"Best hand soap I have found. Cleans and rinses off very well. Don't laugh, but can even use it to wash my face! Completely unscented. LOVE IT!!"
178548,0,"I bought this same identical item at Bed Bath and Beyond 6 years ago, LOVED IT and it took 5 years before the shelf started to rust. I have had this one up less than a month and it is already rusting. NOT HAPPY!!! I bought some clear Rustolium paint to try to stop this. Other than the premature rust I like the product."
74812,1,"Excellent. The perfume is divine. Leaves hands soft and smelling great. it is a bit expensive, but it makes me feel rich and pampered and life is short."
105220,0,"The scent was amazing and absolutely as described. The problem is that it doesn't last very long at all. I ended up using an entire bottle in about a week. If the scent lasted, I would give this product a perfect rating."
222933,0,"I received the product in time but the package was torn. The mailing box is perfect, but the product package is torn and the container looks like it has a lot of scratches."
17606,0,"For years I used the Redken's Clarifying Shampoo weekly on recommendation of my stylist. It has lemon and other citrusy fruits and really, I mean really cleans your hair. When you're done, your hair is squeaky clean. I ran out of that and this Suave Clarifying was the only clarifying shampoo I could find at Walmart which really had me baffled. I went ahead and bought it with the clarifying conditioner. Used it today and yes, it does clean the hair but no better than any other shampoo. My hair felt nice and soft and had very few tangles. But, it didn't really clarify like I wanted and I already have my favorite shampoo and conditioner. The funny thing was that the ""longer lasting fragrance"" was what was advertised on the bottle, not it's ability to clean hair. The scent wasn't bothersome to me and I am sensitive to fragrances. It smells like something between fresh and floral. I can't put my finger on it, but it's just fine. I'll probably use this about two times a week and hopefully the rest of the family will help me out using it up. I doubt I'll repurchase."
135001,0,"Love the jumbo size, but there are not enough rollers. They work well, and the flocked feature protects from hair breakage, compared with the plastic coated type with little spikes. What I do not like is that the plastic case breaks easily....I am on my second set, and it too has broken. Also, hair easily collects in the bottom and is difficult to remove. Would prefer a soft sided carrier, which would be much easier for travel. This model takes up a lot of room in my carry-on bag."
138134,0,This product is very nice and creamy but it made me break out a little so I think it's too heavy for me.
792,2,I love this product however I will not purchase from this store again. I gave a low rating the first time due to the fact that when I received the product it was leaking and that the sprayer top was broken. I had to transplant what was left of the product into another spray bottle so I could use what was left in the bottle. I was contacted by the store and asked if I would take down my review and they would replace my order. I did and still have not received the replacement product. This was before Christmas. Would not order from here unless you want to get half of what you pay for.
235106,1,I am over 50 years old and have very soft and wrinkle free skin. Dead sea salts has taken my skin to another level. Try it and you too can see the difference.
244335,2,"I first tried this lotion when staying with my aunt, she had horrible acne and used this as a face moisturizer. It feels greasy when you first put it on, but leaves your skin very soft. I do not use it on my own face, but works great on my legs and hands. I do not recommend this product for it's price though, you can find something just as good for way less."
81992,2,"The perfume is not a clear color like it is in stores, it is very dingy looking. The product also does not smell like the right perfume; it does not have a clean scent. It smells like its really old or something is mixed into it. Very unsatisfied."
47237,0,"I'm 24 but I've been taking extra good care of my skin since I was a teenager so I'm always on the look for good age prevention beauty products! I recently decided to invest in a good night cream and noticed this one while shopping at Target but was hesitant and didn't end up buying it. When I saw that I can get it for half the price here on Amazon I decided I might as well try it because of the price and I also ended up getting the Olay Regenerest Eye Illuminating Cream (which I love!) I got this in the mail only a few days ago but so far it seems like a pretty good hydrating cream. I only have two complaints with it so far - 1.) the scent. Unlike all the other reviews I don't care for the scent at all. It seems a tad overpowering for a night cream. You'd think they'd make it a little more subtle. Also, the smell reminds me of a grandma. Or this aweful hand lotion my mom used to use in the early '90s! But I guess this cream is targeted for someone a little older then I am? and 2.) everytime I put it on, it stings my eyes a little and they go red! And I don't even get it anywhere near my eye area. But other then that it's a non-greasy, extra moisturizing night cream thats worth giving a try if you haven't already. Because of my two complaints above, I think I will continue to look for a better night cream for me. I think I will try the L'oreal Skin Genesis Night Cream next."
228521,0,"I do like this body wash for the smell and the ingredients. I find it does lather up a bit when I put some on my sponge. Found it can be pretty pricey on some sites but fortunately I was able to get these body washes for under $5-$6 for each tube (including shipping and handling) and each tube lasted about 2 weeks for me when I used them so it wasn't bad. I really enjoyed using just about all of them, just wish they lasted longer while in use."
50012,0,this really worked. my skin was soft and wrinkles were diminished and skin had a younger look. I saw results in about three weeks. Definitely would recommend this product.
136510,1,"I saw it on an infomercial and was instantly drawn too it. So i came on here and read the reviews to make sure it worked like they showed on tv. And when i saw the reviews i was a little nervous because it is so expensive and some people don't seem impressed with it. but i took my 20% off card to Bed bath and beyond and bought the straigtener. wow! its an amazing straigtener! whenever i straightened my hair before it was not that straight and about 10 minutes after i straightened it, it was worse then before. But the first time i used maxiglide it was like the hottest day of the year and i was outside a lot and my hair stayed straight! it stayed straight all day! wow! It didn't really pull my hair like others noticed. I mean i'm sure it could if u didn't comb it out or if you have a certain type of hair. But I only had a really small amount of hair pulled out. less then if u brushed it or something. Ehh the steam option. I'm not sure it works all that well. a little steam comes out but i thought it'd b more. It is kinda big and awkward at first but it takes no time at all to get used too. Its definetly worth it if you want pin straight hair! It makes it shiny too!~Lisa"
198068,2,"I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year. The iron stopped working. I thought, ""Great! Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!"" After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet. This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron. DO NOT BUY!! WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn't even have a valid warranty!"
99158,2,"This hair gel has very little going for it. Here is my reviewPros:Smells niceCons:Very light hold, almost non-existentIt turns into a hard crust! This hair gel dried into a crunchy mess on my head half an hour after application. The crust comes off and flakes.Some products from this company are amazing, but this one missed the mark, badly."
186507,0,I thought that this product would do wonders I guess. Not really anything special that I couldn't have found at Walmart Or Target for 1/10th of the price.
208989,0,"I have the Buxom gloss in the color ""Tonya"" and I love how to color works - not too bright, but with good color payoff. The color lasts a loooong time, but I feel like the gloss is too sticky and the plumping effect burns my lips - so much that they stay red overnight and became chapped in the morning. I didn't notice much plumping - just burning. I think the Too Faced Glamour gloss was a better option for me - less sticky and the plump does work without searing my lips."
94599,1,This perfume is one of my girlfriend's favorites! It is not easy to find and I was able to get it at the best price around.
217082,1,This is a gorgeous holographic pink polish. I can't believe Sally Hansen discontinued these. Pick them up if you find them.
197419,2,"I really liked this flatiron UNTIL it broke on the 40th day after it arrived. As Amazon (and all internet sellers) is NOT an 'authorized' dealer of Farouk Chi products, the one year warranty is not applicable. AND after 30 days Amazon won't take it back for returns.I will have to buy it again at salon prices in order to get the warranty for the future."
13181,0,"A good basic cleanser. White gel/cream formula won't run out of your hands in the shower. Effective at oil-busting and setting up a beard for shaving.Suds tend to be watery and it frequently runs in my eyes, which really burns.While it's 100% plant derived, it has an intense Ivory Bar Soap fragrance which you may or may not like. (I'm not too fond of the smell)Does not include any alpha hydroxys/exfoliants, so look elsewhere if you have acne, blackheads or large pores."
132919,0,Ive used this product before. It's a good face scrub but it is very crumbly. I always have to add water to it. It almost has a homemade consistency to it. Also the metal cover on the jar tends to rust after we while. I leave it in the shower so I'm sure that doesn't help.
79851,1,"I found this product several years ago at my Salon. It was just perfect for my type and length of hair. Unfortunately, my salon stopped stocking the product and the only place that I can find it is on-line. I've heard that Matrix has discontinued making it!"

65158,1,"This makes my hair so soft without being greasy. The softness does start to wear off though by the end of the day. I guess that is better then it getting greasy. It also takes away a lot of the frizz from my hair, but not quite as much as I would like. Another great thing about this product is that it does not weigh your hair down. Oooo and the scent is really nice and fruity. So inexpensive too and the bottle is huge so it lasts a long time."
205210,2,"I received this entire line of Fresh Curls products directly from Redken. I had the shampoo and conditioner and every single styling product in the Fresh Curls line. I expected so much more from these products. This was my first time trying this line from them and I was SO disappointed. The shampoo is so watery as is the conditioner. You had to use a TON of conditioner and even then it still didn't feel soft and detangled at all. I have really long hair and using that much conditioner at a time really depletes the bottle very quickly. The styling products, particularly the spray gel made me hair feel so damaged, it wasn't even funny. My hair was so dry after using it each time. I cannot even believe this product was made by Redken.One thing I would like to add in regards to the other reviewers stating that they purchased this from Amazon as well as other retailers, not in salons; Redken will tell you flat out that if you buy Redken from anywhere other than a salon, the product IS watered down and is not the same product that you would buy in a salon. I have noticed that Redken products, as well as lots of other salon brands are now available in Kmart, WalMart, Target, etc .. even in our grocery stores here. This does seem odd since they were only available in salons for so long. They call it ""Diversion"" and supposedly they are not the same products at all. You can go to the Redken website to read more about it. It is very interesting. Redken does not and will not supply their products to any retailer other than a Salon. Redken is made by Loreal and other products that they make are Pureology, Matrix, Shu Eumura, Kerastase, Mizani, as well as others. If you see any of these brands for sale at mass merchants such as Target, Amazon, etc, they are not supplied by Loreal and are to be deemed counterfeit. None of these retailers are authorized to sell these products. You can contact Redken directly via email or phone and report these unauthorized sellers and they will pursue it on their end. They will reply to you and quickly too when you email them. I have reported several local retailers to them. I would suggest visiting the Redken website if you are interested in more info on this. I just thought I would add this info since there were comments made that they thought the formula was different. I received mine directly from Redken and I feel it was still poor quality, so I cannot really compare. There is a very good deal on other lines of Redken products here at Amazon right now and I am so tempted to buy, but keep thinking about diversion and know I won't receive authentic products. They only supply their products to actual professional salons so there is no chance that it will be authentic if I order from here. I hope this info helps someone."

What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
139212,2,"***UPDATE!****I was very happy with my new curling iron....until it died only a few months after I had purchased it-- it died in February, around Valentines Day. I mean, died as in completely dead, right before I was to leave on a trip (I went out of town sporting some really flat hair). I plugged it in one day and it remained cold as ice. I tried different outlets around my home to see if the GFI had tripped. But no, it was the iron. Keep in mind, I only used it two or three times a week in a home setting where it was plugged in for no more than 30 to 45 minutes at a time.Like most Americans, I am no longer surprised by what I call ""The (Made In) China Syndrome,"" where electrical appliances have become almost disposable in nature. But even though I'm not surprised by these short-lived appliances, I am getting really sick of it. It's not so bad when a manufacturer will stand by their product and replace it without a hassle or undue cost. But that is not the case with HOT TOOLS. Their ""warranty"" consists of the consumer paying the shipping to send the item to them, PLUS enclosing a $5 check for return shipping, unless you live in CA where apparently they cannot legally charge you the $5 return shipping (all states should adopt this policy).I took the iron to the USPS where they told me it would cost just under $10 to return it. Plus I would have to send that other $5 in. So, it would cost me $15 to get a replacement for an item that is undoubtedly defective.I am thinking about going ahead and sending it back simply because I am sick of buying electrical products with what I have deemed are bogus warranties. Manufacturers realize that the expense and hassle of enforcing the warranty is probably not worth it.I am also getting tired of ""The China Syndrome."" If manufacturers insist on having their products made in China, they should step up quality control or offer a consumer-friendly warranty. Many companies do.Aside from going through the warranty process, Hot Tools is on my list of ""never buy again."" From now on, I will investigate a warranty before I buy anything electrical or stick to those reputable companies that offer a consumer-friendly warranty.Here is my original review:This has been one of the best buys I've made from Amazon.I always use ""professional"" curling irons at home on my unruly beach hair because they have higher heat settings, and that's what it takes to make any kind of lasting difference with my hair.When my 1.5 inch curling iron died after 6 years of daily use, I began looking to replace it. I considered paying close to $100 for a popular brand name, but after reading the description and reviews on this Hot Tools, decided to go with it instead, and at a substantial savings. Boy am I glad I did! This curling iron heats up in a flash and has/does everything I need. There is an adjustable heat setting and a swivel cord so styling is easy. There is no auto-off feature, which I like, so that the curling iron doesn't turn off if I can't get right to it (just have to remember to turn it off before leaving the house!).The 1.5 inch barrel is perfect for my mid-length hair. Like most people, I've tried turning my flat iron under to get a little bit of bounce or shape, because I don't look good with stick-straight hair. But a flat iron just doesn't do as good a job as a big-barreled curling iron and sometimes leaves a line. I also use a curling iron close to the roots to give my hair some lift, which I haven't been able to do with a flat iron. For everyday hair, it takes me about 5 to 7 minutes to get the look I want. For special occasions, I use small sections and setting ""product"" to do big, loose curls. It takes longer, maybe 20-25 minutes, but a 1.5 inch curling iron like this produces an excellent result.In short, this curling iron does everything I need it to do at a fraction of the price of that more expensive brand. What more could I ask for in a curling iron?"
29215,0,This sort of smells like a very mild egyptian goddess to me (another of their scents which I have used for years) so I like it. It's good for being casual as opposed to being a goddess.

74905,0,"The first time I used this hair dryer the smoke alarm outside of my bathroom started going off. The dryer was not smoking nor did it emit a burnt smell, so I think it is the ""cloud of ions"" that set off the alarm! I cannot use a dryer that sets off smoke alarms, especially when I travel, since it would set off the alarm in my hotel room and everyone in the hotel would be mad at me! Other than the smoke alarm problem, it did do a good job of drying my hair quickly and without a lot of frizz but I don't think the frizz control was due to the ions, I think it was due to this being a brand new hair dryer with lots of heat and lots of power. But after using it the one time I had to return this dryer and get one without ""ions"" so I won't set off any more smoke alarms."

21957,0,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
163928,1,"I'm a henna artist, and got a few of these for party gigs where you're not always guaranteed a good light source. Let me tell you, they work great! They're small, lightweight, and easy to pack in my on-the-go henna kit. The light is also easily adjusted to point where you need it to. My boyfriend stole one of mine for installing hardware in his computer. I would suggest having extra batteries handy if you use it regularly on gigs, because my batteries didn't last quite as long as I was hoping (though they did last through multiple gigs)."
193317,2,"Femme opens green, and I detect citrus & pepper. As it moves into the heart, I get sweet spring florals (narcissus, lily) with a green sharpness (rhubarb?). On me, Femme dries downs to a soft woody with an organic-smelling musk. There isn't fruit in the base but rather cherry wood, plumtree wood & cedar wood.Overall, it lasts, even in winter, but I'd say most appropriate for cooler weather. On me, it's unbalanced - quite strong at the start and a skin-scent at the end. Although not my thing, Femme is unique & distinctive and it's high quality for this price point. I doubt it would appeal to most, but I don't think it should. It would be signature worthy for the right wearer.The bottle is quite unusual and is one that collectors should take a look at. I have the 30ml plexi-glass bottle (dark pink) and it fits perfectly in my hand. The cap it black rubber with an integrated spray, supposedly inspired by the silhouette of a curled up woman. Whatever.The bottle I received was new old JCP stock that still had the price sticker on it. The 30ml originally sold for $30 ten years ago."
241255,1,"Joop! Night flight is brother of the classic cologne Joop! I have to say this cologne is also very nice. It sort of smells like the classic Joop!, but with a twist of a fresh shower. In other words, Night Flight has a very clean smelling fragrance. As for the length of smell, I have experienced this cologne to last quite a bit. I am not sure if this cologne is only suppose to be used for the nightlife, hence Night Flight, but it can be used at night or day. Like original Joop!, Night Flight is a wonderful scent."

I did notice the tingling for the first 2-3 days of use, but it didn't bother me and lasted only a few minutes. I used it daily for a couple of weeks and then one day I was looking in the mirror and thought ""Hey, what happened to all those little lines on my upper lip and around my mouth???"" They didn't disappear completely but were much less noticeable. The deeper lines in my forehead even seem to be softened somewhat--I'm hoping they'll get even fainter with continued use. I haven't noticed my age spots fading (at least yet). I ordered three more jars though--I'm sold on this product!"

It is a great product for every day or weekly use!"
198232,2,"Chi used to be a good product. Since they went into mass production with these you would be better off saving some money and buying something from Walmart or Target. I realize that Chi is a big name brand and I LOVED my chi that I bought in 04. It died, I had my new Chi less than a year, it never did a good job on my hair and I was glad it died so I could buy a different flat iron. But consider that you can buy a Chi at Kroger (no kidding-saw it there yesterday for $99.99), I think that speaks volumes about the quality now. If it can be bought in a grocery store, don't have high expectations for this product."
52210,0,"I bought this item because I'm a bit of a koala fan, as are my three young nephews. I was sure we could all have fun with this very sweet headband.When it arrived, I was pleased with the headband's color and apparent durability. However, the actual size of the koala ears is nearly just *half* of what is pictured. The headband's ears look like small, white tufts -- not like the prominent ears shown in the picture. Even after some combing, I can't get the ears to resemble the picture. There's just not enough fur.Perhaps the koala headband will still delight my youngest nephew (age 5). However, I'm pretty sure the older ones (7 and 9) will tell me right away that these ears only vaguely resemble the very prominent and endearing ears of the koala."

19492,2,"As I've stated on other websites, this product is NOT for dry skin!! I plunked down $250 to try it all and try it all I did. I gave it months of trials trying to get my skin to look wonderful like the infomercials..I would even have settled for my skin looking a tad better than it did. No dice. It caked, it stuck to my dry patches, it streaked, it did nothing for the dark circles under my eyes, it made my face look floury like a clown and I hated all of it and it all sits wasted in my closet. There is NO miracle makeup, different makeup works differently for different types of skin and I can't see how this dry powdery substance with no moisturizing qualities would even remotely look good on dry skin."

However, I did find that I had to reapply every night before bed, not every other as directed.I also bought a book called ""Thumbuddy to Love - Ballerina Sue"" here on Amazon as well ( there is a boy version too - Fireman Fred, I think). It comes with a little story about a little ballerina conquering thumb sucking, a little ballerina doll ( I think it is meant to go on your finger somehow, but my daughter just cuddled it) AND the important thing is a little book of star reward stickers. My five year old took great pride each night in putting her sticker on the little enclosed chart when she got through the day successfully. When she ahd a fully successful day ( no thumb sucking at all) she got a star sticker. In the first week, she had a day or two that she would say she forgot and put here finger in her mouth, but the Mavala reminded her to stop...so I would draw in a star for good effort and honesty.The chart has 21 or 28 days and she had stopped by 3 weeks and we went through the chart 2 times ( double stars on each block) just to be sure there was no bcaksliding.This productThumbuddy to Love: Ballerina Sueworks, but try a little reward reinforcement as well!Good Luck."

67137,0,"In 2004 armani release a great cologne named armani BLACK CODE. As the bottle shown above is depicting. This cologne was renamed and changed (reformulated) to be much milder and lost its distinctive peppery smell. Do not confuse the two, they are not the same. See the description of the two colognes below. I attempted to spray the ""code"" that I received from amazon today after ordering the ""black code"" to see if they were indeed the same. The ""black code"" on my right arm is much stronger and makes me sneeze when I put it on but lasts a lot longer and blends well with my skin, It smells a little peppery/leathery and is very masculine. I can still smell it after washing my arm 6 hours later. The code faded quite quickly (an hour) and was in general much much milder in odor than the ""black code"" fragrance. While black code was discontinues many black code users may be disappointed to try the newer cologne as it really is not the same. I don't blame amazon for the switch as Armani brands them the same but it is clear to anyone who smells the two that they are very different.

43892,0,"Considering I've had better, I'm less than satisfied with the Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro. My previous clippers were the Wahl Designer Pro 8355-400, which worked great for about seven years and the blades stayed sharp. The only reason I replaced them is because the motor finally died.The Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro is adequate for the price, but if you want better quality and can afford the extra $15 or $20, I suggest buying the Designer Pro model instead. I use the clippers to shave my entire head, so if you only need them for trimming the edges or if your hair is thin, the Chrome Pro should be good enough.Here's a comparison of the two models:Wahl 79524-500 Chrome Pro1. Without the setscrew on the bottom plate, blade alignment is fixed and straight2. It is not likely to cause any nicks3. It gets the job done but takes more passes than it should to get all the hairs4. The on/off switch is easy to operate by thumb5. More ergonomically shaped and the soft grip is nice6. The smoother contours make it easier to clean7. Lighter and quieter than my old modelWahl Designer Pro 8355-4001. The blades are more adjustable with a setscrews on the bottom plate, so it cuts closer2. It takes a steady hand to set the blades straight and it's possible set them to cut TOO close, in which case it can nick the skin3. Cuts more efficiently (i.e., gets more hairs in a single pass)4. The on/off switch is inordinately difficult to operate with one hand5. The design is basic and not the most ergonomic, but still easy enough to handle6. Assembled of more parts and fewer smooth contours, cleaning can take more time7. Quite noisy and a bit heavier than my new modelBoth models have the handy ""multi-cut"" lever on the side to adjust the depth of cut, and each comes with a 5-year warranty. The Chrome Pro came with 23 accessories for which I have no use and would rather not have paid for, but it seems all clippers in this price range are only sold in ""kits,"" so buying the spare combs and guards is unavoidable.Finally, I would not consider buying any model cheaper than the Chrome Pro for concern that the quality might be less acceptable."

193590,2,"My wife bought this for me as a gag gift, now I see that it is actually sold at a hair loss solution. So funny I am no longer laughing. You put this on your head and the whole office will think you are the class clown. This product essentially is a paste that glues carpet fibers to your head. Basically making you a human chia pet. If you want even better results, go to the hardware section and purchase some spray paint to fill in the gaps. The paint will last longer, and prevent your head from rusting. All sarcasm aside, this is not the solution we men have been looking for as we want true results, not false hope."
86269,2,The instruction says: Not for under 3 years old. This information is not to be found anywhere although the reviews suggest that this product has worked for 18month old. Not able to use it since my child is less than 2 years.
219967,0,Sweet smelling perfume. I have aways loved Cerruti. The 1881 isn't a disappointment. Now i think i should have gotten the bigger bottle.
8331,2,The microfiber stuck to my skin and I returned the item.
132620,1,I had never tried these pore strips and couldn't find them at my local grocery store. So I found this store and bought them online to test them out. They work amazing and the service of getting the product to me was fast and efficient! A great shopping experience!
79411,0,"This shampoo smells great and gets hair really clean, but my only complaint is that it is really drying on hair. I used it today for the first time and it dried out my hair the same way Matrix amplify did. I am very disappointed. Maybe I need to use it more and my hair will get used to it? What I don't understand is my hairdresser uses it on me when she colors my hair and it never feels as dry as it does today. I really hope I am wrong about this product, I want to like it badly. If my hair is still dry after a months use I will go back to Redken Blonde Glam."
240398,0,"It bleaches so i dont like to use it as im scared it will ruin my clothes.only Time I can do it is before a shower, i usually allow 15 mins before."

214053,1,"This almond oil is not only a great deal, it is high quality product. Absorbs quickly into skin. I prefer oil over lotion because the oils are what moisturize the skin - there is no need for all the fillers. NOW alomnd oil also serves as a great medium to add other nutrients that can help heal and protect the skin. Easily add green tea extract, vitamin D3, and vitemin E, or even astaxanthin to create a powerful and nutritious healing oil."
176600,0,"This product does help with blackheads, but it is very harsh. I have a problem with excessive oil on my nose, causing blackheads, but in spite of the oil, if I use this more than every 4-5 days it dries my skin out to where it peels. Which is a lot more unattractive than blackheads!"
247473,0,"The polish is a beautiful color, but it dries matte and is very thin! I was expecting it to be better."
102984,2,"Excellent seller, all delivered as described.We did look at reviews for this product, but chose to ignore the most important one. The ingredients have most definitely been altered and it is very poor compared with the original mix we used to purchase in our opinion. This is not to say that the product is poor, simply does not accord with the ones we used to purchase."
145606,0,"Since this was a gift, I cannot speak to its efficacy. I bought it for a friend to use as an alternative to shaving, in order to hide greying pubic hair. She has not reported on how well it works."
121312,0,"My wife has no end of beauty aides and sometime she leaves them around and I discover them. One is Sunsilk Anti-Poof Creme. Well, I have poofy hair and I've never been able to do much of anything about it. I suppose you'd call it curly, and the curls go just in any old way rather than in organized waves. I've finally just learned to live with it and not worry about it. Actually, my best time was back in the 70s when people were wearing their hair in the Afro style. Well, I could grow as good of an Afro as almost anyone and that's the way I used to wear it. Sadly, fashions change. Now, my hair is just unruly and the only counter-measure I have is to cut it real short. Too bad. I'm rather pleased to have a full head of hair in my 70s if I could only control it better. Well, I tried my wife's anti-poof creme. It seems to work at first, but then if it gets ruffled by sleeping or something like that, it's right back to nature. Well, I'm going to go back to not worrying about it.Gary Peterson"
116344,0,"I've only used this particular gel a few times. It has a very strong aroma/odor. I suggest that if you use this product, you make sure you also use some type of cologne with it."
19742,1,"Since having children my hair has become very dry and coarse. I have tried everything from Matrix and Paul Mitchell to cheaper drug store brands to smooth my unruly hair. I was even considering Kronos (over $100.00), I was so desperate! I wish I knew about this stuff months ago when I thought cutting my long locks off was the solution to end the frizzies :(I was very disappointed to find that no matter what I did, the frizz stayed! Biosilk has given me the hair back before my hormones wrecked havoc on it!!! I am VERY satisfied with this product!Cheers!"
13530,1,"Great ! No stains , fast tan. Lessons the need for extended stays in the sun. Used it for 4 years, and will continue to do so."
26762,0,This was a fun product to try. I liked it especially because the color was a softer brown and not as harsh and dark as some that are also available. It was also interesting in that it has a wax pencil on the opposite end of the brow pencil. This is nice to help keep stray hairs in place and looking professional but the wax tip does break off easily. I would purchase this product again
195414,2,"This item, Tourmaline 1043, does not have the speed and heat settings advertised on the box! We purchased it for the advertised 8 speed and heat settings. It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. Low heat is no heat. Medium is too high for low heat needs, like for fine hair. This is misleading advertising by the manufacturer."
232305,1,"They leave my hair looking professionally done. While the curl doesn't last--for some reason, it leaves my hair looking softer..."
173880,0,I like this product but I doesn't stick to the bottom of the shower like I would hope. You want it to suction so you can really drag your foot across it and sometimes it comes undone and starts to move.
176297,0,"While the product itself is fine, I suppose, I was very disturbed when I received the package. There was nothing in the product description that stated it was ""unboxed,"" yet when I opened the package, there was a small bit of packaging around the top and top of the sides. There was clear tape/packing around the rest. It was not in a whole box! I specifically chose this one because it DID not say that it was ""unboxed."" This makes me wonder if it is indeed a ""true"" Chanel product. Since this was a gift for my daughter, I was not happy at all with the packaging. And, as I say, I hope that the product was real Chanel. I suppose that remains to be seen."
241450,2,This is not a real Chi. I was very disappointed when I bought it. I did the research online and sure enough I was sold a fake. It did not do a good job on my hair either.
155656,0,"There were some good parts of this book. I think I can't review it appropriately because I seem to have good boundaries and just didn't find much that was helpful to me personally. But if you are a person who has difficulty in this area, it might give you some good ideas and insights."
173246,1,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT VALUE AND WAS DELIVERED AS PROMISED. THE FRAGRANCE IS MY BROTHERS FAVORITE. SO THIS IS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM SANTA.
205835,2,"I USE THIS PERFUME FOR YEARS. AND IS THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENS TO ME THAT ALTHOUGH THE BOX IS THE SAME, THE PERFUME NOT SMELL ANYTHING. IT SEEMS THAT WERE TRUE water .- I KNOW THAT IS CHEAPER THAN THE DUTY FREE, BUT IS NOT PERFUME. AT LEAST THIS , IS NOT THE CABOTINE BY GRES THAT I USED FOR YEARS."
29522,1,"Ogilvie foam perms are the best! I've put in home perms for over 20 years now. This foam solution is wonderful not only for the person getting the perm, but for the person giving it. No running mess, so quick and easy, and it covers the hair and rods in all the tight little places so well."
5399,2,So Ive been using this for about three weeks and I havent really seen a change in my face. I have bad acne that comes and goes and when I got this in at the time my face was pretty bad broken out. Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts the ones I already had really havent gotten much better. Im still using it hoping that it might take a few weeks for it to really kick in but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now. Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes. I got it just under my eyes and that part of my face was on fire for two days!
227979,1,"Love this stuff. My poor little lady has very curly hair like myself and my husband and it was always getting tangled in the back while she slept. After several very unhappy instances of trying to comb it out I decided to get this. It smells great, works great, and isn't full of chemicals, which is the main reason I love Cali Baby. Would highly recommend. If I ever see it on sale I will be stocking up for sure."
77747,0,"Michael Kors by Michael Kors is a beautiful unforgettable fragrance for women. It is rich, with deep floral scents, and I think it is a somewhat sensuous scent. It is powerful without being overwhelming, when you first spray it on. But, unfortunately the fragrance that does not last long. I love the fragrance, no staying power that is why I gave it 3 stars."
118979,2,"I didn't realize it, but the ""3"" in the title meant that the barrel diameter is 3""! So the total diameter of this brush with the bristles is 5""! I can't imagine anyone needing a brush that big. Other than that, it looks to be a nice brush, just be forewarned about the size."
145755,1,"I really thought the ""ionic"" drying system was just tech hype, but this thing really dries quickly! We use it mainly to dry the dog; just point it at a spot on his fur, and it's dry within seconds. It's a BIG dryer, and not as quiet as we'd hoped - still scared the dog a little at first."
202164,0,"A birthday gift for my wife, this nicely arrangedbasket containing bath care products was deliveredto our home only four days after the order wasplaced at Amazon.com. She's delighted with theselection of items, thank you.Frederick S."
198929,0,"I bought this item based on the reviews on Amazon and from what others have told me about their ceramic irons. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for my hair, which is natural, very curly and very very thick. The CHI got my hair about as straight as blow-drying would have and my hair frizzed as soon as I stepped outside. As an African American woman, I would only recommend it if you have a finer grade of hair."
42948,2,"HORRIBLE!!!!!! It is not the real thing. I am shocked that they can sell this on Amazon. I am honestly reconsidering ordering anything from here. It looked legit, but once my husband opened the bootleg product he realized that the word CODE was stickers that came right off. It doesn't even smell like it.. I am furious. DO NOT PURCHASE this product unless you have tons of $ and just like giving money away to crooks."
33867,0,"It is okay..it zaps your face , but I have seen no results . I would of giving it 1 star but the shipper was so fast..i would deal w this dealer again , but the product is to large for my face , I don't think it works as the company claims"
201066,1,My wife loved it. New West is still her favorite perfume. It's no longer made since 1996 or so and is hard to get now days. It was sent fast and arrived on time.Excellent service.
217056,0,"This product is OK, but must be used very sparingly, as hair can become a little sticky and limp."
166367,0,"I didn't mean to give this product three stars! I meant to give it five. Sorry, I was reviewing multiple items and mistook this for a different item. This is a great product. I don't know why Amazon failed to mentioned that everything in this basket is organic and natural. I really felt like I got a good deal with this item."
128940,0,"I first purchased this product at a shop in the Caribbean, when I needed a general-use body cream. I loved the scent of this olive oil product, and it is easily absorbed into the skin. I've since switched to another olive oil product, however, due to the parabens and other chemicals found in this body butter. It does not purport to be paraben-free or organic, however, so there's no misrepresentation. It was the creamiest, most nicely scented of the body butters I've tried."
113823,0,"I have used this product and this same shade of OPI polish for quite sometime now and because I had run out and was unable to get to a salon, decided to purchase it thru here. It goes on like OPI but somehow has more pink than the previous bottles that I have purchased from salons. I'm not sure if this means it is a knock off or maybe just a different batch.Overall it works just as well, its just a slightly different shade."
195723,0,"the only issue i have with this product is that it doesnt leave my hair feeling soft and sleek......it does add volume though....but since i have thin hair, it just makes it look frizzy. um as far as growing hair, i'm not sure. i mean you would have to use this product for months before you can honestly say you ""grew"" hair."
18889,0,"First of all, expect a lot of dust -- especially with the foundation powders.Also, if you use the entire system, it becomes very cumbersome to apply this and that with this or that brush.The lipsticks are mediocre at best. I own the Mauve, Red, and Wine Lip Colour Kits and I really am not fond of their consistency (I got all as a birthday gift).I think that Bare Essectuals is way overpriced for what you get.It starts out easy, but when you begin building an entire collection, expect to spend big bucks if you include the brushes and special liquids to prep the skin and/or make liner last.The system is OK, but I will not be purchasing more in the near future.It's just too messy, cumbersome, and expensive.Even the packagining is not very impressive!"
3105,1,The most heavenly frangrance. I follow my man around enjoying his wonderful aroma when he wears Ungaro. It makes you want to get close to him.
79630,0,"I have been using this product for atleast a year. All of my hair care products for the last 2 years have been Aveda products - including professional coloring the last few months. In the summer, it's perfect. In the winter - regardless if my hair is treated or not - my hair becomes strawlike. I have to use other products to help out with the dryness. It does get your hair clean and not alot of buildup. Amazon does over state the suggested retail prices."
135626,1,"Artec Textureline Paste is the Best for men's short hair. I makes it lay down but is not too hard like some that are on the market that is used to spike hair. It is very hard to find in salons or beauty supplie stores. I had one place in the Valley Plaza Mall in Bakersfield, Ca called Salon Secrets that carried it but they went out of bussiness and now I can't find it anywhare in Bakersfield now. Very frustrating when you can't find a certain hair product that is so good no where in town. Very glad I found it on Amazon.com. If anyone reads this post and has information whare I can buy this product in Bakersfield, Ca please e-mail me and let me know at ronwoolley@aol.com. Thanks."

57855,1,This works really well on dry skin... even feet. I just wish it didn't smell so medicinal.
36154,0,"Smells good, maybe not quite like a Hawaiian hibiscus or gardenia. Very thick shampoo.Seems to clean well enough without all the harsh surfactants. Overall, I like the AubreyOrganics line and what it stands for."
229264,1,I love this Henna kit!! The only problem is that the paste doesn't stick on your skin very well. It's hard to get a dark design.
229963,2,"I don't like this product at all, it does not cover anything and it's very hard to apply, will never buy again."
28939,0,"Before purchasing this item, I did read the earlier reviews so I cannot say I wasn't warned. I found it true that the fragrance, however lovely, did not last. I did find it lathered well, using my shower pouf. What I did not expect was the astringent quality of this product.After using this product daily for awhile, I found my skin becoming very dry and requiring additional application of lotion (which also killed this product's fragrance).I don't need to wash my hair every day but after a few applications, my hair began to frizz out, as it was very dry. I guess the ingredients label says it all, not much but chemicals in there."
39064,0,"This scent has a strong powdery, sweet smell, not floral and woodsy like, say, Eternity by Calvin Klein. This is more like Obsession for Women. Three stars given because husband likes it and it's long lasting. Purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves it."
48417,2,"I bought the 3.4 ounce Emporio armani perfume for women by georgio armani. However- it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I got it. The bottle was identical but there was no serial number like the real Emporio has on the bottom. Also, the bottom of the bottle had glue sticking out from it like someone opened the bottle, refilled it with something else and glued it back shut. I have worn this fragrance my whole life and this is definitely fake- probably right from China- beware! I went to post a review about this but suddenly the product disappeared from this sellers collection of perfumes!!! I got a refund... but lost S+H charges... DONT waste your time or money!!!!"
196644,0,"The iron heats up fast and does what it is supposed to do. My hair is very thick and I have to go through layers to flatten it down, but once I do, it stays in place. The ceramic area is smaller than I thought it would be. I dropped it once and it seemed like I broke it, but I unplugged and plugged back in and it worked fine."
170097,0,The green nail polish looked very bright and opaque on amazon. I thought it would be cute under OPI's black shatter. So I bought it and it turned out looking like marker on my nails. I had to layer like 4 or 5 coats and it still wasn't the true color. A bit disappointing and not very opaque. The color isn't a bright once you do 4 or 5 coats but it doesn't look as much like marker.
220465,0,"This brush blew me away when I first got it. After a month or so, I noticed that the bristles were coming out. They get bent over and just break off easily. It doesn't work nearly as good with missing bristles. I'm kinda disappointed."

I thought that a .07 inch width would not be drastically different than a 1 inch frame, but unfortunately it made a big difference in time spent on straightening.It seems like this product would be good for finer hair, but if you have thick, curly hair and not a lot of time, I would go for the 1 inch."

I DO NOT recommend this product as offered by this seller!!!"
174863,2,"It advertises two mirrors - one magnified and the other regular. However, you really only have the magnified mirror as a choice, as there is no way to get light with the regular mirror. How dumb is that? I only wanted the regular mirror and assumed the magnified mirror would be an option, not my only choice. The magnification is so huge that you can barely see - I just see a giant chin instead of being able to view my face. What a waste of money. I returned this immediately."
244561,0,This was not for me. It caused me more breakouts and made my rosacea flare up even more. It does work nice on the neck area but no miracle product.
186304,0,I gave it a 3 because it is what I wanted but it does make my hair frizzy. I have made up a solution that includes this product and my hair stays straight and now I can use it everyday.
53947,0,"I purchased the set of hot rollers hoping to find an easier/quicker way than a curling iron to smooth out my naturally curly hair and add back some curl after blow drying it with a round brush.As a newbie to hot rollers, I didn't find it too hard to put the rollers in, but I was sure stymied by that clip! No way of putting it in seemed to be all that effective at holding the roller in place! Another reviewer shared a link to a video on putting in the rollers that helped on that score, though the clips are still pretty bad at holding them firmly in place.The rollers seemed to reach temperature quickly(if the little indicator dot on the one roller is accurate). My complaint is that the rollers really do not retain enough heat to penetrate my thick hair all the way to the roots. The rollers were cool and the outsides of the sections of hair never got more than warm. This means the rollers weren't totally effective at smoothing frizz and imparting body."

So I decided to try this product instead.Unfortunately, for its price, it's not worth it. The bottle was tiny (I should have checked the size before I brought, but I figured at just over $10, there would be more in a bottle than there was.) and although the quality seems okay, I didn't think that the bubbles lasted any longer than my preferred product.I won't be buying this again due to its high price.

220985,1,"I was looking for a product to add to my hair that would give it shine, make it manageable, and overall, not affect my face. I was using another hair product that contained a lot of additional chemicals and my forehead was in constant breakout. My mother recommended Jojoba Oil and I gave it a shot. After reading reviews and product description, I gave it a whirl. From hair to all over my body, this stuff is amazing. I never felt so nourished before, like my skin was actually drinking this stuff. The first day I tried it I took an 8 hour train ride and the entire time, I just felt GOOD. My skin didnt have any reaction, in fact, I kinda had, and still have a glow immediately after application. I added a few drops of lavender oil for scent, and its even better. I apply after my shower, and even a little to my face before I shave as a pre conditioner. Give it a shot. It's natural, and you wont be disappointed. I would also recommend ordering some raw coco butter (I even add that to my hair as well) so you can switch it up every few days. Give your skin what it needs."
159811,0,"I haven't used it yet to see how well it stays inflated. But this thing is a Bugger to inflate!!! Tiny, tiny, tiny valve for blowing it up. Do not recommend if you have breathing problems or get light headed. Otherwise it's just your typical travel pillow."

Over the Thanksgiving holiday I bought two from the Sephora store and my suspicions were confirmed.How I know the ones i bought from this amazon seller are fake: the texture, the length of time they last (one or two months whereas the real ones I had bought previously lasted 6 months each. These fakes actually broke on me which the real ones did not do), the fact that they don't stand up at the base the way real ones do, the fact that they don't expand as much as the real ones do. Buyers beware.I have photographic evidence and kept a fake as well. So I can back up my claims"

It is one of the few products that doesn't bother my allergies and has a scent that stays fresh and true. However, it is no longer available. I ordered this as a substitute. Don't order it expecting the same scent. This lotion has a soapy smell to it and is not light and pleasant. The scent is perfumy but not necessarily lavendar."

229781,2,The clarity of this mirror is good - but with only one suction cup it tilts and you have to bend your neck to use it. I've taped a post-it pad to the back to level the mirror.
152679,0,"I have (for the most part) normal hair which can get a bit oily during the summer or when I exercise.To be fair, this product does everything that it promises to: it freshens your hair and absorbs the oil and sweat - but so does any baby powder.I've been using baby powder on my hair for years for that same purpose and this product doesn't do anything that baby powder doesn't.The thing is, I have dark brown/black hair and anyone who has ever tried putting white baby powder on dark hair knows that its a not a pretty sight.What this product has going for it is that it's supposedly for dark hair (i.e. it should blend in as opposed to white baby powder which stands out).The product description says that its for ""red, brown, or black hair"" but the powder itself is actually more on the reddish side so it still stands out on my dark brown/black hair and thus still requires fluffing and brushing (albeit slightly less) to camouflage it into the hair all the same.So considering it does the same thing as regular baby powder and (unless you have reddish-brown hair) requires nearly the same amount of effort to apply it, then $15 seems to be quite a steep amount to pay (keeping in mind that a container of baby powder that is 3x the size of this little thing is 1/3 the price).Oh, another qualm I have is that it is supposed to smell like lemon cookies but to me, it smells like coconut - which i'm not entirely fond of.So all in all, if you're going for value for your money and don't mind spending an extra minute or two fluffing and brushing, then I would definitely recommend just buying baby powder (I particularly like Johnson's Baby Powder Vanilla & Jasmine or Burt's Bees Baby Bee Dusting powder) BUT If you'd like to save a couple of minutes on the primping part (which is great in the morning when your alarm didn't go off and you don't have time for a shower and every minute counts), then by all means, get this product."

239003,2,"This product is great, I wear it everyday; However, when I purchased it from Amazon, it came to me from a perfume wholesaler. It was not the same scent that the bottle states it was, it was a fake. When I contacted the company, they told me to send the bottle back to them and they would do testing in their laboratory. They said they would send me a new bottle. Well, that never happened, and after getting the runaround several times, they refunded my money. That is the only reason why they received 1 star, because they did refund my money"
248241,0,The bottle was not round like this picture it was rectangular shaped. It is extreemly strong smelling I got the smell on me just handling the unopened package.

I agree with the other reviewers who found it to be very thick, greasy and somewhat gritty. This is why I'm only using it at night. Although it probably rubs off onto my pajamas, it hasn't caused any problems and seems to wash off fine. I wouldn't wear it during the day or under anything you couldn't throw in the washer. That being said, I do like that I still feel it on my stomach when I wake up in the morning and the smell is fine. Also, a little goes a long way and I expect this tub to last at least 3-4 months. Not sure yet if I'll buy this again when it runs out or if I'll try out a similar product."

199804,2,"I have been wearing Polo cologne for over 25 years. I have always purchased from a major department store or a major retailer. When I ran out I recently decided to use an Amazon gift card and purchase my Polo on Amazon, thinking I could save some money.The product was sold through a marketplace seller. I had read reviews about customers receiving counterfeit fragrances from Amazon marketplace sellers in the past, so I weeded through the sellers to find one that appeared to be legit. In hindsight, I should have spent slightly more money and gone with the nationwide fragrance chain store that was also selling on Amazon. Then I could have been certain that what I was ordering was legit and I could have stopped into their bricks and mortar store here locally if there were issues.The product packaging for my order was all top notch and very genuine looking. The labels, wrapping, box, and even the printing on the bottle was all crisp and precise. It passed my visual test.The fragrance smells the part, so that passed my sniffer test. I thought all was good.After a few weeks of daily use, here is what I can say: this is not Polo cologne. I had one final spritz left in my bottle that I had purchased from a major department store so I compared. Wow, is there ever a difference between that fragrance and what I received from Amazon.While the initial ""scent"" appears to be the same, the counterfeit loses its effectiveness after a couple of hours. I have to apply it twice a day, using twice as many spritzes as I normally am accustomed to using. This means I am actually using 4x as many spritzes as I was using with the genuine product. With the genuine product, 1 spritz lasts the entire day for me. With this counterfeit product, I have to use 2 spritzes in the morning and 2 in the afternoon to equal the 1 genuine spritz.I am very disappointed with my purchase and I am in the process of notifying Amazon customer service about a refund. If what I received actually is a counterfeit and Polo didn't just reformulate the product to make it weaker, then these marketplace sellers need to be vetted more carefully because this is not acceptable. If I wanted to purchase a replica scent I would have gone to a replica source and paid a fraction of what I spent on this. Not happy at all!"
224814,1,"Covergirl classic tan matches my skin tone perfectly. It is just dark enough and not too orangey like a lot of other foundations are when they are for tan skin. Growing up, all my mom would wear is covergirl foundation so naturally it was the first foundation I ever tried. As I got older, I tried all different kinds, low to high priced, different formulas, etc. I realized that if I wanted to have a reliable, natural looking foundation for a lower price, this would be the one to try. My skin can get dry around certain areas but CG smoothers hydrating makeup does the trick. I am wearing it right now as I am typing this. It has stayed on all day long throughout my work day. It moisturizes my skin but does not make it look greasy or oily. I would definetly recommend this foundation for anyone with dry skin. I have had no problems with this at all I only have good things to say about it:)"

4908,0,"I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued. I am NOT impressed. It reeks of ""that sunscreen smell"" and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours. It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets. Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing."

86224,0,"Updated: This didn't work. $1800 later, we now have a thumb crib. Oh well. Best to try the cheap alternatives first!This works pretty well. My son is 7 and still puts his thumb in his mouth, even though he doesn't fully suck on it. My biggest issue is that a) now that his adult teeth are coming in, he's developing an overbite, and b) when his thumb's in his mouth, his index finger tends to make its way into his nose (ick). My son has no idea that he even puts his thumb in his mouth, so it's hard for him to stop on his own. This stuff tastes bad enough that, when he does bring his thumb to his mouth in those absent-minded moments, he takes it away. The hard part is remembering to reapply. The habit isn't licked yet (no pun intended), so I need to be diligent. I don't know if this would work for a hardcore thumb-sucker. My son is old enough to agree that he doesn't want to suck his thumb, so we're not really forcing anything on him by using this. It might be different with a younger kid who sees no reason to stop."

I would expect something of this price to last longer than one year! There was a strong, acrid burning smell, the core turned bright orange and sparks flew out of the back of the unit. I've had similiar things happen to other hair dryers (I have long hair and dry it daily) but they cost alot less money and lasted almost the exact same length of time. If you don't dry your hair as often or as long as I do, maybe it'll last longer for you...?"

I tried to return the second bottle but since it is a ""hazardous liquid"" I am not allowed to return it to Amazon LLC. My only consolation is to leave feedback that can save others from wasting their money. DO NOT purchase this product. You will be disappointed."
217809,2,"I don't know, maybe its just my naturally medium brown hair color, but I have had problems getting rid of my gray.About 3 years ago I became single again and am fortunate enough at age 59 to still have a full head of hair. Going to my regular S-Cuts stylist I asked her about their ""Color Camo"" hair coloring treatment for Men. The advertisement said It would leave some gray, while coloring the rest. I agreed that afternoon to finally do it! Although ""Color Camo"" was an improvement, when I got home and took a look in the mirror I was shocked. My hair was completely colored (as NO GRAY) dark dark brown, and it looked very un-natural. The end color reminds me of a Hersheys Chocolate Bar, dark brown with a slight red tinge. Not one hair was my original color. Anybody who saw me could obviously tell I JUST colored my hair. So when I woke up the next day I decided to call my stylist and tell her it was too dark. To which she said no problem, just come in and she would fix it.As a fix for my chocolate hair she suggested putting in 2 shade lighter highlights, and stranded my hair in that old tinfoil thing that no guy would want to be seen with. The result did look more natural, but again there was no gray to be seen. Luckily as my regular stylist she didn't charge me for the additional highlighting. She apologized saying they had some new dye, and that dye might be running dark, or was left on too long. I believe the cost was about sixty five bucks to have a haircut, color, and highlighted next time. Way too expensive for me, so 2 cuts later we tried just coloring it once again (this time no highlighting). I told her to make note of the dye mixture for future consistency. The result, the same chocolate hair color. And so the saga continued for almost 3 years. Luckily after a three weeks the color balanced out and looked more natural.Last week I thought... maybe it was time for me to color my own hair? I researched a lot of customer reviews on Men's hair coloring products, and decided on ""Just For Men - Light Brown"", the lightest brown shade before going to dark blonde (which is impossible to find in the stores). All the ""Just For Men"" boxes state ""TARGETS JUST THE GRAY"". Hmm, sounds like this might work. A good suggestion someone noted was to select a shade or two lighter than your normal color which would make the gray appear as highlights. In my case I have a 30% gray count with a clump of gray in the middle of my part. I was in need of another treatment since nothing was left from the previous coloring 3 months ago.I followed the ""Just For Men - Light Brown"" instructions included in the kit. A two part mixture, it also came with gloves. Hair coloring is a timed process and this manufacturer suggests the 1st time you apply the solution to let it set for 5 minutes. However I must point out that it may take up to 3 minutes just to apply the solution and work it into your hair. Avoid applying it just below your temples where your sideburns start to leave some gray. I have short hair and I was surprised I used up the whole bottle (also applied some on my mustache). Start the timer. As with all hair color products the mixture will stain your skin, towel, or clothing exposed to the solution. As a result you are quickly cleaning it off your skin while waiting out the 5 mins. I followed the instructions, used a timer, and jumped into the shower at the end of 5 minutes. The result, NOT ONE HAIR IS THE ORIGINAL COLOR and is close to 3 shades darker and looked un-natural. So once again, I have Chocolate Hair!As for ""Just for Men"" coloring kits, I have used their Mustache kits many times. The color lasts about 3 weeks, but the remaining dye goes bad quickly. I have found that using Hair Dye instead keeps the color the best for Mustaches, and a bottle lasts much longer. Then again if Mustache coloring goes bad, your can always shave it off. Not so for hair!(sigh) At this point if a professional gets the same color results as an amateur such as myself, what am I left to do? I have the feeling that ""COVERS ONLY THE GRAY"" color system's do not work, and result in a complete coloring of your hair. And the shade is not even the color on the box. Any suggestions or personal experiences are appreciated, but just one thing I ask. If you happen to see me on the street in the next few weeks, Please Don't Eat My Chocolate Hair!!Update 7/2012:Well my Chocolate Hair stayed much longer than I expected, almost 5 weeks. The color eventually lightened up, but still after 2 months was my hair darker than before application of ""Just For Men - Light Brown"".I searched around and found the ""Just For Men - Sandy Blonde"" hair color at my local CVS. After application my hair turned into a light brown, my natural color. Again it is all one color, no grays which again shoots down their ""TARGETS JUST THE GRAY"" slogan.I am pleased this time, but I keep my fingers crossed that it dosn't get alot lighter. So if you have light brown hair, I'd suggest starting with ""Just For Men - Sandy Blonde"" and avoid Cocolate Hair all together!"

2543,0,I bought this because of it's power. It's difficult to find a hairdryer that has some power that's not over $75. The yellowbird is a little heavier than I'd like so your arms get tired fast.

59683,0,"The bottle says it's unscented but oh my, it most certainly has a scent (and not a nice one). It smells almost rancid. I used it to wash my daughter's hair and scalp because at 2 and 1/2 she's still got cradle cap. I have tried olive oil and a super fine toothed comb, scrubbing it with a toothbrush, dandruff shampoos (which scare me because if you get that stuff in a toddler's eyes it will burn like mad) and even tried scraping it off with my fingernail. Nothing worked completely. She has very sensitive skin and fine textured blonde hair so I was worried about using any other harsh chemicals. I read about Dr. Bronner's and decided I would try it. With one application most of the cradle cap is gone. It had a gluey consistency but washed out clean and left her hair looking nice. However, it also left a stink that made my baby girl's normally sweet-smelling head smell rancid. I even tried rising with my own scented conditioner but that didn't work. I shampooed again tonight with a different, scented shampoo but I can still smell the Dr. Bronner's stuff. Needless to say I will use this very sparingly, as a last resort, and try to use some kind of other heavily scented stuff to cover up the smell as best I can. Bottom line: it works but it also stinks."

247592,0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
116238,0,"Yes bigen has long lasting results and is resistant to fading, but it comes at a cost. It is a metallic hair dye. That means even bleach won't lighten it. Your stuck with the color til it grows out. Second, it isn't natural as people seem to believe. It has peroxide. If you read th box it says no mixing required, well that's because the peroxide is in the mix, so that's not much different then your boxed dye. And yes, there have been severe allergic reactions associated with this dye. I'm not against this product, I just think you should be aware of what your getting yourself into if you choose to use it.Make sure you want to be dark, for a long while if you have long hair.Do an allergy test.And read the fine print, its not really that natural, but it its better then most.I've seen great results and happy people who use it.I've seen very upset girls after they tried putting dye, bleach, color remover etc, and realized that the're stuck, either grow it out or cut it off.And twice I've seen really gross blisters on the scalp and face, both were long time users who ignored the warning signs.

127357,1,"I had a Braun blowdryer with a volumizer attachment that I was dearly in love with - but the poor thing was 10 years old, and almost on its last legs.Now why would anyone want a volumizer? Well, it's perfect if you don't like your hair plastered flat on your head like you just got a lube job. A few seconds with a volumizer ""lifts"" your hair up a bit by the roots and gives it some body and style without using a curling iron or rollers.Most women just looks better with some height - heroin chic just isn't for everyone. :)It's really hard to find a blow dryer with a volumizer attachment since the ""high hair"" look died. This Panasonic one was the only one I could find, so I took a chance for $20.I was in AWE! The volumizer attachment is 3 times bigger than the Braun one I had. It takes give seconds, putting it on the crown of your head, and your hair has instant lift! Fast and quick!But the thing I hadn't counted on was this ion gizmo. My hair looked like I had just had a deep conditioning treatment! The texture of my hair is thick, but wavy and a bit coarse when blow dried too much. My hair was like SILK! What incredible shine and texture!The dryer has several settings that aren't just ""low"" and ""fry your tresses."" The syling setting is great for drying, and the finishing setting just dumps ions onto your hair, making it look like you just had it styled in a Fifth Avenue salon!There's also a cool shot button that helps ""set"" curls or waves where you want them to be.If you aren't Kate Moss and like your hair with some body to it and a blinding, silky texture, I highly recommmend this blow dryer!

Just another reason to give this dryer a try - it's one of the few things that actually does MORE than you expect!)"
87475,0,"The first package that I received - the lid had broken off and the polish was spilled all inside the package - thus I had a lot of sticky liquid in my hands when I reached in the package. Looked like a heavy package was thrown on top of this package to cause the bottle to break right off at the neck. I called the company and they sent me another bottle. The second bottle I received was wrapped well in bubble wrap, but the lid had not been tightly closed and thus more leakage from the bottle, but not that much so didn't holler this time. I found the liquid to be VERY thick - almost unmanageable - could have been due to cold weather. After letting it sit at room temperature for several days, it has thinned somewhat. I have found that I need to put this stuff on pretty much every day or every other day. I guess the only problem is in their shipping! Probably should have been shipped in a box of some sort.

111760,0,"If this styling brush had longer nylon bristles and a larger barrel, I would have given it more stars. The bristles don't grab my hair very well. On the plus side, it does make my hair shinier and a little bit fuller. I have fine, straight hair so I need all the body I can get. The hairstyler is just a few months old, so I can't comment on the durability yet. One big negative is that it is very loud! Compared to my old Conair hairstyler, this one is at least twice as noisy. I'm afraid it is damaging my hearing. I hope newer models will be quieter."

Wearing a frock made of frugly drapes and singing-Sound-of-Music-in-a-meadow green. Sung *is* THAT kind of green, which immediately disqualifies it as *my* kind of green.Sung opens *so* LOV that it's scary. It could be Coty's Mugeut de Bois. The LOV is enveloping and lovely, perhaps perfect if *your* kind of green is LOV. Mine isn't.Wow, the LOV just won't go away. I am sensitive to many white florals. Sung was asthma-inducing. Love you, Alfred Sung, but not your namesake perfume.The bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous. On the other hand, the black, plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap & tacky.There are a few perfume critics who say 'women should not smell like flowers.' Sung is a bed of LOV. 'Nuf said."
185968,0,"This product is actually a lotion, not a creme which I expected. Being a lotion and rather thin in consistency, you will have to use a lot more. This is especially true considering the fact that there does not seem to be a whole lot of moisturizers in it. I find my cheap Suave hand lotion moisturizes my skin better, and at about 1/50th the cost ounce for ounce."

160813,2,I purchased Angel fragrance recently and I'm very disappointed. Obviously the bottle is old. It smells like it has been sitting on a hot shelf for years. I didn't check the return policy before I ordered and of course Amazon will not allow me to return it. DON'T buy fragrance from Amazon unless you want to get stuck with old perfume that smells bad. I will never buy fragrance from Amazon again.
246677,0,"I really like it, I usually use Salt Scrubs. Oh, this sugar stuff is much better. If you ever used salt scrubs then you know how they can burn if you have any nicks or cut on your hand, body, etc. Sometimes I'll forget and shave my legs, well then I can't use the scrub. With the sugar scrub you can use it whenever. I like that. The product itself is okay. I would like it if the oils were a little thicker, for lack of a better word. Overall it's okay."

158002,0,"Well I bought this cologne online by accident trying to buy TOMMMY by Tommy Hilfiger from the list of ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon (of which I bought all of them). I did eventually get the real Tommy and can compare them. TOMMY is already a very clean and fresh citrusy scent that does smell really good, and is much brighter than others in my collection already. The TOMMY ""T"" cologne takes that even a step further, and instead of smelling lemony fresh, you smell lime fresh. At first I thought it was a bit too bright (and perhaps it is), but the top edge wears off after 20 minutes or so and the lingering scent grows on you after a while. If picking one, get the real TOMMY (or just get HUGO or CANDIES), but I will get decent use out of this I'm sure."

48930,0,"Rochas man is a great fragrance, with a nice coffee and vanilla accord. The fragrance itself is affordable enough for almost any budget. While the scent itself is appropriate for many occasions, it lacks durability, meaning that it can be worn when you know you won't be in any one place for any length of time."
29517,2,"I used this kit to try to at least get some of the frizz out of my hair. Since my hair is very frizzy and curly, I did not expect my hair to end pin straight, but I did hope to see some improvement. To me, the smell was not as bad as many people say; just about as bad as any hair coloring kit smells. I followed all of the instructions exactly as they were written, but in the end my hair is about twice as frizzy and not straightened at all. I also cannot brush my hair because the brush will not go through parts of my hair without ripping out the hair. I only lost a little bit of hair during the actual ""straightening"" process, but I will lose a lot more now if I force a brush through. From the other reviews, it sounds like this product will work for some people, but it did not for me."
131333,0,"It says it has an ""rich luxurious lather"" on the back, and it is the total opposite of that. Maybe its just my hair, but the lather is terrible and it doesn't feel like its cleaning my hair at all. Obviously, I somewhat expected it to be like that, because its sulfate free. I just don't like how they put that on the back. It makes me wonder about what else they claim. Other than that, its an okay shampoo. I definitely recommend it if you can find it for a cheap price. They sell this shampoo at TJ Maxx for 33.8 oz. for only $20. I'd say its worth about that price."
249891,2,"I started using Tints of Nature 4N to try to correct the dreadful redness that came with the Naturtint colours. My hair is a medium golden-brown and I was aiming for a darker golden-brown. My results were:- Less fake-looking red undertones than Nauturtint.- Colour lasted about 3 weeks before fading became obvious. About 60% colour remained at 3-4 weeks.- Greys were covered adequately.- Condition was bearable. Hair was 'squeaky' and tangled easily, rather than soft and silky, and the ends were suffering, but all of this was less severe than with some other chemical dyes.- No allergies or irritation.- After 3+ months of using this product once every 3-4 weeks my HAIR WAS FALLING OUT at such a rate that my hairdresser panicked and wanted me to see a doctor! My hair became so thin it was ridiculous. I had to stop using the product.At this point I officially gave up on chemical hair dyes! I researched how to use a mix of natural Henna, Indigo and Amla herb powders. This has been freakin' fantastic!!! My results are:- Hair loss normalised within 2-3 weeks.- Condition is superb - silky, soft, full.- Colour is natural-looking and very resilient - 90% remaining after 3-4 weeks.- Grays are adequately covered.- I am not doing untold damange to my health and the environment by using gross chemicals.I WILL NEVER LOOK BACK. I am actually ashamed that I was so ignorant of this awesome, far superior option for safely colouring hair! For anyone whose hair is on the spectrum of 'stawberry blonde - copper - auburn - brown - black' (i.e. everyone except blondes) I cannot recommend highly enough that you dump chemical colours and learn to mix and use henna/indigo/amla at home. There's no comparison and you will never look back."

83838,2,"One person stated, they saw a difference in one day. To me, it seems like a clear coat of nail polish would have the same effect as this product as all it seems to do it smooth out the filing marks. My nails are still peeling daily and chip with the smallest amount of contact with any object. When I remove the product, my nails look as bad as they did before. They are not healing at all, just growing out."
103217,1,"I originally became addicted to foaming soap dispensers for economical reasons. However, the ones you can buy in the store wear out and are so small you have to keep refilling them. This is a great solution for the kitchen. This 1 liter bottle is GREAT...I could not be happier with my purchase. And, it comes in a 2 pack. So you get 2 dispensers--even better!! Highly recommend! Use it up and then make your own. :)"
129642,0,"This product has only one flaw...the odor. It is a light, non-greasy medicated lotion, that absorbs quickly, but it has a strong, unpleasant odor. I ordered this product for my husband whose hands are dry and cracked from working outside in the cold weather. I always know when he has used the lotion because of the unpleasant odor. Otherwise, it is a very good product."

206884,2,"This soap started off pleasant enough, and it seemed like I was really getting a huge bar of soap for the money. It was gentle and effective, but after a month or so, the bar began seriously melting and turning into hideous, slimy green goo that got all over my shower. The goo still cleans more or less the same as when it was in bar form, but I will never buy this soap again, or any other from Kiss My Face. Prior to the meltdown, I would have rated this soap three stars.Just for the record, I have never had this problem with any other soap in my life (whether regular, ""natural"" or organic), so I have no idea what Kiss My Face is doing wrong with this formula. Buyer beware!"
204085,1,This is a great product - light and super absorbant. It's the perfect size to go around your head. I would highly recommend it. Delivery was very quick too.

The Sephora pencil went on really smooth & easy, the color is great. I was real happy with this one & threw out the others. the only problem seems to be it flakes off a bit during the day, which can feel annoying & require re-applying. All in all, though, I'm pleased!"
151283,2,"I usually enjoy Neutrogena products but this face wash really missed the mark. The formula included a musk scent intended to make this more of a ""men's"" skin care product. Just because a product is marketed toward a man doesn't mean it has to smell like a forest or wet dog. Also, the fact that it's a face wash and the scent is inches from your nose amplifies the scent. Keep it simple, make it work and you will have happy customers. Get rid of the scent in the future please..."

159156,1,Love the pencils from Sephora. I am alway buying them. I find them easy to use and small enough to carry in my make-up bag which isn't really for make-up but holds other things.Most of the time the colors are really true and this one was.. though I don't remember which one this was-- other than it was brown.It works!

225812,1,"I love this perfume and it has the added benefit of being the least expensive of my favorites. I'm not very good at describing scents, so I am going to quote another reviewer on another site:""A bouquet of flowers presented in a black leather gloved hand, Bandit is no scent for the timid. Bandit is a perfume of its time, created for Piguet just after the liberation of Paris in 1944. It is not the gentle femininity of post-war return to the kitchens backlash, but instead an avant garde statement of women's strength, capability, and take no prisoners attitudes that saw them through the hard times.""There is a sharpeness at the beginning, like the crack of a new leather whip calling one to attention in the aldehydes. As it dries down, the softer leather, a well worn biker jacket comes into play, confident and rather comfortable if not necessarily ""soft"". This is a must have for collectors of classic fragrances that were of their time and yet became timeless.""Hmmm. I don't know if I think it is that edgy, but it IS special."
130003,0,"I really like http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Care-Therapy-Shine-Booster-3-4/dp/B000EGIF7U and I was looking for a new moisturizer, so I thought this product might work for me. Unfortunately, it's very thick and leaves my hair looking grayish-white because it doesn't coat my hair well unless I mix it with another product. When I finally get it into my hair well, it does an okay job of keeping it moisturized. Luckily, it's light like the other optimum oil products so I can reapply it every morning without my hair getting weighed down. Still, I'm going to keep looking for something that I can put in my hair and just leave for work, instead of spending extra time rubbing it in, trying to make sure my hair isn't white."
175723,0,"I REALLY wanted to like this product more than I do. I even waited several months to review it, hoping that it would grow on me with time, but alas, this is not the miracle product I was hoping for. It holds plenty, and I can leave it in for hours, but it seems to leak, so I wouldn't trust it with whites. It's easy enough to remove as long as you bear down, but unlike tampons, it holds fluid, rather than absorbing it, so removal tends to be messy. I also find inserting it to be painful at times and generally have to walk around with it inserted for a few minutes before it stops being distractingly uncomfortable. Nevertheless, I suffered recurring yeast infections for years, which I'm now convinced were the result of regular tampon use. Since starting to use this, I haven't had a single infection, which really makes me think this is a boon to women's health. I also like how pocket- and eco-friendly this product is, along with its resistance to stains and odor. I just wish there was a way to try one with less of a monetary sacrifice, and I definitely recommend looking at the brand comparison chart you can find here: [...]"
170241,0,"The product was just delivered yesterday. Applied the polish to my nails and it was MUCH darker than the polish in the picture. After doing some research, the polish advertised in the picture is actually Chine Glaze Aquadelic. I will not be sending this one back, I still like the color, but it is much darker than I expected. It looks a little funny since I have a paler skin tone. It is also a matte finish. I expected a shiny finish since the polish is called ""china glaze"". The color is still pretty, but it definitely needs a top clear coat to make it shiny. If you want the polish color advertised in the picture, look up China Glaze Aquadelic polish."
237257,1,"Product came in on time and secure, thanks!I never used real soap before Dr. Bronners soap, now I think it is the best cosmetic choice.A softer feeling on the skin is noticeable after switching from body washes.I have a big bottle of the hemp peppermint and like the tingling sensations from the oils, very refreshing.This makes a great shampoo as well but the conditioner rise is needed! It helps soften out tangles that the soap will naturally leave. I brushed my teeth with it but still might stick with toothpaste for a while. It tastes a little soapy (imagine that).People will notice the smell of this soap on your skin. I like it but my wife hasn't decided, so I might try another scent or the baby mild next time.A funny thing, my cat is going crazy smelling my skin after I took a bath in the stuff.The best new thing I have tried in while!"
200973,1,"I have to say that it does work if you are already an outgoing person. The scent is sweet and not overpowering, which is what women like. The pheromones do work if you let the one you are interested in smell you first for a minute or so, and then approach her. If you are a shy person looking for others to come to you, it won't work. It will just enhance what you have.In my case it worked wonderfully because I am constantly involved with people at work and at church. I got noticed considerably more after I wore it, and two out of three times I got a date or a phone number."
78388,0,"It seems that the &#34;all natural&#34; claims of this product are a little iffy. Since I have not researched this myself, I will stick to reviewing the quality of the product. I have medium brown hair with a few grays sprinkled in and I used the Chocolate color. I thought application was fairly easy. I ditched the skinny applicator and just dumped the product into my gloved hands, rubbed them together and applied the product. I found that the consistency was rather thick so it did not drip out of my palms. The color turned out very nice and shiny and the gray coverage was very good. I will say that the color fades rather quickly as compared to the traditional gloss I usually purchase from the drug store. I always have a slight staining on my towels even over a month later. I would recommend this product but warn that re-application may be needed every month for best results. I would also suggest researching the ingredients a bit more to determine whether or not you are getting the &#34;natural&#34; product you think you have purchased."
134191,0,"Plugged it in and let it heat up. It heats up fine, but I can't slide it through my hair without it snagging and breaking my hair. This is very disappointing to me, especially when I had great expectations."
731,0,"Love the color! But face it, who wants to wear something on their lips that tastes & smells pretty bad? I have to put a strawberry clear gloss over it just to cover that up. But like I said, it is a very nice color though.. and looks different from the bottle color when it's on."
178451,0,"I wrote a previous review for this device, based on my research as to its effectiveness, and summed it up with a cautiously positive opinion. That review discussed the FDA approval (based on the device being safe, but not necessarily effective), independent peer-reviewed studies, and the Dateline show that followed a HairMax user for one year (note that he was using it in combination with drug treatment). I received a few comments disregarding my review because i hadn't used the device, so here's a new one based on my actual experience.Yes, I took the bait. I'm a user now. I figured that I'd rather spend the money on a non-invasive, non-chemical treatment that will leave me with a device to sell rather than a prescription to a drug that reportedly has the same odds of success.First impressions:It shipped out late (2+ weeks), with no alert from the manufacturer (I ordered direct). The package I received was missing the instructional DVD and the second set of combs. The DC plug was difficult to fit into the device and the lasers were not aligned very precisely (the beams diverged noticeably at two feet away - I doubt that this matters at all, other than an overall indication of precision). Hmmm... not a great first impression.First 10 weeks:The process is fairly straightforward... drag the comb across your entire scalp at least twice, taking enough time to make sure the laser penetrates the scalp. Half an inch every four seconds, with the entire process taking twenty minutes or more. It's not at all painful or unpleasant, but it does require a commitment to make the time in a busy schedule. I chose mornings right after my shower on M-W-F for the procedure, and this worked well. The manual mentions that more treatments probably won't hurt, but they still recommend the prescribed 3-day treatment every week. The manual also mentions that wet, clean hair (before gel treatments, spray, etc.) is preferable. Makes sense... water makes tissue more translucent. Drop some water on a piece of paper and hold it up to a light for an example of the principle.I experienced accelerated hair loss in the first 10 weeks, which was mentioned in an online report. It didn't bother me too much... the combing process involves working the hair against the nap and using a comb to clear it away as you progress. My hair wasn't used to this type of disruption.I also experienced increased body to my hair, which was also mentioned in the report. I attributed this to the same combing process... the device gives out a very small amount of heat, and as you comb through your hair it dries in a fluffed position. That leads to increased body much like blow-drying might.The report also mentioned reduced gray hair with some users. Lately I think I may be seeing this as well, and I'm not complaining. Perhaps the thinner, weaker gray hairs are falling out.Unfortunately, what I didn't see in the first 10 weeks was convincing hair growth. And this is the tricky part... how do you know for sure? I mean, even without any kind of treatment, my hair looks thinner on certain days when I haven't washed it, or if I've worn a hat, or my mother-in-law is around. And when the stars align just right, it can sometimes seem thicker as well. So how do you know whether the device is really working, given our subjective perception? You can choose to believe the independent studies (while wondering who paid for them), you can choose to believe the personal testimonies (while wondering about their compensation as well), or you can choose to just believe. Or maybe not, and return the thing (they give you 20 weeks for a return). I chose to keep going, based on desperation more than belief.Next five weeks:I'll update this review (if it stays up on Amazon) as long as I keep the device, and so far I've used it for approximately fifteen weeks. I've neglected to use it maybe four times in those fifteen weeks, due to a lack of time (four out of forty-five... not too bad).The lasers seems solid, but the beeper seems to go haywire now and then, either sticking on or going silent for awhile. Hmmm.I've had a bit of an uptick in my opinion. It may have been just the planets aligning again, but my hair seems thicker overall, and definitely less gray. Then again, days later it seems thinner. Again, this is really a tough thing to gauge, given so many variables. For now, I'll keep forging on, but if I don't see more certain results by the holidays, you'll see my LaserComb on eBay. It'll be easy to spot - the one without the CD and with only one set of combs.Final update:Forgive me for not concluding my review... it's been quite some time since I wrote my original comments, but I stopped using the Hairmax after about five months of use (and too late to take advantage of their 20-week return policy). In the end, I found I was fighting time (in more ways than one) and time is one tough cookie. Although I think the HairMax probably does work to some extent, I just couldn't take the time needed to consistently use the device. Perhaps that's a sorry statement about the busy nature of life in America, but I think it's better seen as the ultimate comment regarding this device: I couldn't find the time to fight time itself.If you think you might have more commitment to the battle than I, the HairMax might be worth the effort. I chose to work out a peace agreement (okay, I surrendered). My hair is thinner than ever, but I no longer mind as much. I've accepted the fact that I'm getting older, and I welcome the clarity that comes with the decision.I'll be selling mine on eBay. As soon as I can find the time..."
48107,2,They use the same base fragrance in all of these shower/hand gels and it is nasty. I don't know how other reviewers give it such a high rating. I had to use alchol repeatedly to remove the lingering smell from my hands after trying it. Nothing pleasant about this product. How hard can it be to add a natural lime essence to scent a wash gel? Camille Beckman uses some kind of artifical scents instead. Yuk.

145821,0,"If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this. I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair. With that said, the various heat settings work well. The concenrator attachments work fine for me. I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.Update: When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it. My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer. I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer."
125836,0,"I just recently purchased this brush and I'd never used a boar bristle brush before. I've always used plastic, inexpensive brushes.I love love love the bamboo construction. I want bamboo everything from now on-- very strong and very beautiful.As for the brush itself, I'm not sure if it is only supposed to be used on wet hair or what, but I can't brush my hair only using that brush. Maybe it's meant for thinner hair, but I like to feel the brush actually detangling my hair, and with this brush I just felt like it was gliding on the surface. The plastic bristles that stick out farther from the boar bristles which I thought would help detangle are very flimsy and bendy and don't serve any purpose that I can see.I wanted to replace my old plastic brush, but I find I need to keep using it to brush out the tangles and then just use this new brush at the end to smooth down any static. So I'm a little disappointed in that respect, since it's a good amount of money to spend on a brush you barely use."
191706,0,"I first ""smelled"" this perfume on someone who was shopping in the same aisle as I. It was a very pleasant, refreshing fragrance. Well, not on moi. Have to use half a bottle just to have some fragrance. Very nice bottle, though. Would not purchase it again for me."
107486,0,"This product works just as well as Wen by Chaz Dean, and it's MUCH more affordable. However, it's still very expensive and it isn't necessarily superior to other, less expensive brands. (I'm using Biolage, which costs around $35 for a one-gallon container which lasts a very long time because it's thicker and you use less. The generic Biotone works just as well at $20 per gallon.) I really like the product, and I recommend it if price isn't a concern of yours. But there are less expensive ways of doing the same thing."

9222,2,"I just spend an hour in the store looking at all the roller sets and sizes. I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted. I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair. I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s. Then, I went at it. Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set. But what I really wanted, I got none of; volume. Instead, I got some atrocious kinks and bends at the roots that I had to recurl with a curling iron to fix. That's what I was trying to avoid! So I'm heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....I hate the kind with the little metal pins."

My husband better be home on time or I will kill him......I rated this a 3 because,,,,i felt like it."
228489,1,I was very satisfied with the products. I felt I saved money by buying the combined products rather than ordering individual ones.
167552,2,"Keep in mind that this straightener is only ceramic coated and pales in comparison to actual ceramic straighteners. I bought this for the low price but with that came the lightweight cheap feel and the horrible results. The plates gripped my hair very roughly instead of smoothly gliding over it. I would not recommend this straightener at all. Don't waste your time or money with this -- I have already returned it to Amazon and received a refund, which I used on the Revlon Satin Finish Ceramic Straightener. I highly recommend that one instead of this Conair piece of uselessness. It costs about $8 more but it's definitely well worth it."
121163,0,"I've been coloring my hair with straight up body art quality henna and indigo for years now. I'm sick of the smell and the grit and how difficult it is to wash out. I also found it difficult to always get the right mix for what I was trying to achieve. I wanted to try something different, but I love the translucent, natural looking quality of henna and didn't want to go with the usual chemical mixes. I did some research and came up with this.I chose Golden Brown. My hair is a medium to dark brown, but I have some stand out grays, and this product did exactly what I wanted it to: it gave most of my hair a sheen and colored the grays a golden blonde color, which makes them look like natural highlights. Surya was also easy to apply and smelled great compared to straight henna. Easy to rinse out. I couldn't be more pleased. Even if I have to use it more often than regular henna, it's much less hassle and I think the grays will be less obvious as they grow in anyway.Edited to add:Well, I gave up on the Surya. Everything I wrote was true, except that the color faded with stunning speed. I switched to darker colors to compensate, and they didn't really last longer. It also bled, which stands to reason. I switched back to body art quality henna and indigo. Lesson learned."
194234,2,"I am assuming this cleanser doesn't make my face squeaky clean because its purpose is not to dry my face out. So I don't want to say this product is bad. But I just don't understand it. Once I am done washing with this product, I have faint raccoon eyes. After that when I use a cotton pad with toner and swipe my face, I am left with smudges of makeup from the day.Maybe this is the way I'm supposed to use it? The product doesn't warn me about it nor does it tell me I have to wash my face twice preferably with another cleanser. Currently that's what I am doing.I am trying to find an organic product without parabens that really works well as a cleanser. I am wondering if this is the best organic products can do without using harmful ingredients."
75194,0,"If this is the type of dryer you want, it is great. I was wanting a UV Nail Dryer. When I did a search for a UV dryer, this product was listed under my search, so I thought it was a UV Dryer. I was very disappointed when I opened the package and found it was not what I thought it was. It is a lot slower drying than a UV dryer. Otherwise it is okay. I think, if it was what I thought I was getting, I would have been very satisfied, but since it wasn't, I was very disappointed in the product."
16278,0,"I liked how clean the soap made me feel. It lathered pretty well, but it was too strong-smelling for me. As a male, I think it would be better to use something with less of an fragrance like Safeguard. I'd recommend it to my friends and family, but only females, because I think it's too strong-smelling for males. It's almost like a perfume smell."

It is a nice ""quick fix"" It doesn't last as long as the Joliese system but I use this to touch up any areas that I might have missed or if I haven't had a chance to put the Joliese product on. It does wash off quicker and you have to be careful to keep a rag handy to dab at any areas that may have too much."
186693,2,"This worked OK for about a week...I noticed results right away but the more I used it the less it worked! It seemed like a nice smooth and creamy formula and no noticeable smell so I thought this would be great especially since I have read a lot of reviews that this stuff was the best ever...guaranteed to work in 7 days...it's more like...""it only worked for 7 days""!! I am ""only"" using it to get rid of it and finish it up because I paid a lot for it. I have used more expensive products and they have worked...I think I will switch back to the other products.!"
30260,2,"I really have no idea what the fascination is with this brand. I've tried so many shades hoping that maybe the last was a fluke. But, this brand is awful IMO. It's difficult to apply, applies streaky, and chips so easily. I much prefer OPI."

104490,1,"I never write reviews on products ever, but I had to write one after using this product. I have dry oily combo skin with mild acne once in a while and this cleanser is by far the best I have ever tried and I have tried literally like 100 different cleansers. My skin was sooo dry from the cold weather and I tried thousand different moisturizers thinking that was the issue, but one day I came across this and thought I would give it a try. After the first use, my skin was not dry or tight not one bit!!! After about a weak my skin was still moisturized and I needed only very little moisturizer on my face and some days I wouldnt use any!!! I can remember the last time I did not use lotion on my face before using this facewash. My skin tone has evened out dramatically, my skin looks and feels smooth. I get sooo many compliments on my skin now and since using this facewash I have not had one pimple!!! Seriously, not one!! Also, my skin has barely been oily and it stays free of oil all day!! I have stocked up on this facewash in hopes that it never is discontinued. If you have not tried it do it. Give it a week or two and you will see awesome results. People complain about the texture, but its what dry skin needs!! A non lathering cream that does not strip your skin and this facewash definitely does not clog pores!!!! This is by far the best cleanser I have ever tried and I used to be addicted to foaming/gel cleansers for that squeaky clean feeling, but all that did was make my skin dry and break me out....so try this and you will not be sorry!!!"
87534,0,"I bought this awhile ago, while on a quest for a really good, light, tinted moisturizer. The product is fine, but frankly not notably different from far less expensive rpoducts form mainstream brands. I am now using the Chanel one, and I like that one a great deal."
95629,0,I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron! I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year). The first time I used it it worked great. The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me. I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.

160225,0,"Toppik does what it advertises. It helps in hiding your hair loss. You spray the stuff on (and I recommend getting the applicator), comb through, and voila! No more bald spots!!However, there are some cons to this product. I will discuss my own individual case. I'm an asian woman in my young twenties and I have been gradually losing hair since my teens. I have very fine and oily hair that needs to be washed everyday, or it will look just terrible. However, I've noticed that lately, after each wash, I was losing more and more hair and my hair is already abysmally thin. I wanted to go three/four days without a wash to see how my hair might improve, so that's why I got toppik. I felt that on the days that I haven't washed my hair, I can at least conceal my thinning hair with toppik. It worked well. BUT. Toppik made my scalp itchy; you also stain your fingers everytime you run through your hair. And the worst thing is when I washed my hair on the fourth day, a lot more hair came out. I felt as if it led to more shedding. I will use it for emergencies only, definitely not something I would use everyday."
129402,0,"This does a little better job than many of the totally manual abrasive devices for feet. I am 70 and have feet that have been used a lot. I have many other devices and have had corns, calluses etc. Those sometimes pass with change in footware, but I always have SOME problems. This product is good and may be better for those who have someone to assist on foot bottoms, but I found it pretty good even for me as I do my own"
122217,2,"This stuff did absolutey nothing for my fine lines and didn't even moisturize. I used it for a few months in the winter/spring and needed an extra moisturizer (I have combination skin). It doesn't smell and absorbs well, it just doesn't work."

I decided to go with Stephanie (it's her name) and hoped she liked it. I was concerned about it being so light/sheer/etc. but she tried it the next day and said she loved it. It applied easily, dried quickly, and didn't need more than 3 coats to reach bottle color. Definitely well done Zoya."

211873,0,"Be careful which Clarisonic product your purchase. Look for the Clarisonic MD, which is the newest/latest model. Some vendors, like Sephora, are still selling the old model (with less features) at the same price. With the MD model, you get three speeds and three brushes.I know this because some friends gave me a $200.00 gift certificate to buy the Clarisonic brush from Sephora. When I attempted to purchase the item from Sephora, in the store and on the Internet, I realized Sephora was only selling the older model. Talk about frustrated B-day gift purpose, this was in February of this year and Sephora still has not updated its stock."
139027,0,"This curling iron has features I would have liked very much - the temperature control, a nice sized non-heated tip, the stand and auto-off feature. However mine didn't work out of the box.

188913,0,"I bought this kit and was pleasantly surprised to the packaging it came in, very nice, the scent wasn't as heavenly as I was hoping but the products are pleasant, nothing extravagant. The scent to me personally was that of someone older, geriatic. The lotion goes on well, not too greasy but pleasant, the conditioner works great and works well on my baby's fine hair, the bath gel is just like any other, the bath salts are okay nothing to rant about. I like the products however, I just personally didn't care for the scent all that much. I give the entire line a 3 star, again I wasn't overly impressed considering the price."

81559,0,"There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn't agree with me. Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can't wear. This time, it's the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, & headache-y.Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent & very under-rated, imo. On the one hand, it's a bright green floral; on the other, it's a deep woody oriental. Complex & interesting, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter. It's not for those who like sugar & cupcakes. Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern & up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding. That's Truth, even if it is a pretentious name."
66424,2,"It never gets hot enough to affect my hair style at all. Also, the on/off switch turns off at the slightest bump or touch while styling. I am very disappointed because this is the only brush iron of this size I can find."

239795,0,"The shampoo is great. After using it only once, it made my hair soft and shiny. However, after a few days, I noticed that my skin broke out around where my hair fell on my face, especially my forehead. I gave a couple of bottles to my sister as a gift and she said the same thing happened to her."
10309,2,"I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn. Not tingle, burn. I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample. Obviously, my skin reaction meant that I can't use the product, but even if that wasn't a factor, the smell was putrid. It smells like decaying fruit. Quite nasty. Bottom line: Before potentially wasting your money on this, try to find a sample somewhere."
204033,1,"This stuff is amazing! You slather it on, rinse it off and your skin is soft and moistuized until your next shower. What I love best about it is that your skin feels soft and moisturized, but you don't feel greasy. I like to rub it on my feet when I buff them and they feel baby soft afterwards."
60522,1,"I am very happy with this hair dryer. Its light weight. poweful, but doesn't burn the hair. a great buy for any professional."
103430,0,"I purchased this along with a new electro massage kit. This is a tiny bottle containing mostly isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. If you read some other reviews you'll see complaints it douses to much solution on the skin. In my case it barely gets my skin wet no matter how hard I shake the bottle. Wetting a rag with clean water will do a much better job, but if you want the skin clean to remove natural grease/oil then just buy some rubbing alcohol from your local drugstore and save your money."
233697,0,"This doesn't give as much color as I was expecting. There was definately a hint of a change, but it wasn't like actual hair COLOR. It is also a VERY MESSY product, and there is just no way not to make a huge mess while using it. I actually decided to use it OUTSIDE in order not to make such a mess in my bathroom! It is also REALLY HARD to rinse out--it takes FOREVER. It also leaves your hair with no shine and feeling like straw. You almost HAVE to use some sort of conditioner to get the rest of the stuff out and to give your hair a little softness and shine. I had some conditioner left over from traditional hair color and I used that. If the color had been really good, I would be willing to put up with all that, but it just wasn't. I tried two different colors and neither one gave very strong color after leaving it on for an hour. It might work better on lighter hair colors--mine is a medium brown. There IS, however, a LOT of product for the money. You could use this on long hair in two applications, easily, and more for short hair. So if you are looking for subtle, safe, natural color, this might be your thing. Just use a conditioner!"
195466,0,This product does hold at two my curls were not crunchy and I have none of that sticky feeling. Application wise follow the directions the trigger is easy to use even at odd angles.
20860,1,"I am pregnant for 4 month now. Before I purchased this cream I seriously studied all kinds of creams and their review. Since this is my second baby, I have some leftover strech mark on my tummy before I got pregnant. I started using this product since my 2 mon in pregnancy. So far, I don't see the new mark coming out however the old mark is still there. Though all kinds of books I also learn that the strech mark will appear when it is time, and once it shows up it will not disappear. No cream can completely remove it. That is nature. However as a tummy cream, this one does its job very well. It smells wonderful, and moisturizes my dry skin and prevents itchness. If you don't mind paying a little more, this is a good choice."
185176,0,The vacuum on these clippers is great but the clippers themselves dont hold up well. I ended up buying a Oster Fast Feed pair of clippers and couldnt be happier.
197053,2,"This is a $10 iron in an overpriced box - no auto shutoff, no temp control, no frills at all. Just two heating elements, a cord, and a cheap switch in a flimsy plastic housing. And... after purchasing, I find that the company will not honor the warranty if purchased through Amazon! Given the track record many problems with this item, without a warranty you're taking your chances on something that's WAY overpriced."
85574,0,"My skin: Sensitive, oily, red/inflammatory, acne-proneI've been using this product on and off for a few years. It's good for people who have bacteria-caused (as opposed to hormone-caused) acne, though of course it could never measure up to benzoyl peroxide, the single most effective known agent at killing P. acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. However, this is a decent product to use if you're not ready to break out the big guns or simply don't have that much acne. It's got a pleasant cooling sensation to it; just don't drown your face in it, it can dry out your skin (therefore causing a reaction where your skin will produce an excess of oil to compensate).Overall: Good for oily teenage skin that doesn't have dire acne problems."
193923,0,"Love the color, unfortunately the polish has no shine. You have to apply a top coat, which never works too well for me."
125182,0,"I do like this curling iron. The cord does not twist, which is great! The problem I have with it is that it burns whatever it sits on. It left burn marks on my bathroom sink because it does not have anything preventing it from laying directly on the surface. I have to put a towel underneath it so I do not ruin the sinktop anymore that it is."
61819,0,when i recieved it i loved the smell but one hour later i had a horrible headach also there is no Vanderbilt name on the bottle so im not really sure if this is how the original perfume smells like.but the price was good so if you dont have trouble with strong perfumes then im sure ul like it

214409,2,"I wanted to try 4711 as I've read it's a lovely fragrance. To my nose, the fragrance is remarkably similar to Jean Nate, though much more expensive. This body wash is Okay, as body washes go. However, what scent might be in the wash disappears rather quickly. Actually this is a good thing, as I find this particular scent to be rather strident. I far prefer body washes which are far less costly and which don't have any fragrance...just a nice clean smell.The 4711 bar soap is actually rather pleasant, and has a fine lather, not enormous bubbles as do some soaps."
180855,2,Disappointed in the color. It actually made mydark circles darker. It seemed very heavy when I barely applied it. Will not buy this brand of makeup again.
71942,0,"I bought this to cover veins on my legs, and while the product is fairly effective- and DEFINITELY does not run or fade away until you wash in shower with rag- it's nearly impossible to match the shade based on swatches shown online. I'd recommend buying from a store such as Ulta so you won't have to bother returning it- and if you do buy online, DON'T go through Beauty Bridge- I had to beg to return the first one even though it was unused and my attempt occurred within 24 hours of receipt."
184034,0,"The color is amazing, but the polish is very thin. Every brushstroke leaves visible imperfections. It's very hard to get an even coat due to it's watery-consistency. I would expect this from a cheap wal-mart brand of polish, not this. Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied."
96544,1,I love this soap! It's fresh smelling and leaves your skin feeling very smooth. I recommend it to anyone! The deodorant in thie soap is fantastic!
42231,0,"I don't have much luck with sunless tanners. I'm very pale and I don't like the health risks associate with tanning in the sun. I've tried many popular drugstore brands I wouldn't go back too. I've tried Jergens Natural Glow, which was my favorite of the low budget variety. It gave nice gradual color but the smell disgusts me so much that I never end up using it for very long. I read glowing reviews about Sun Labs, so I decided to take the hit on my wallet it and give it a try. Keep in mind I only bought a full size version of this product, and not the accompanying scrubs, lotions, etc.COLOR:The color is fantastic and gives you a very realistic tan, even if you're starting off as pale as I am. It's the most realistic ""quick"" tanner I've used, Jergens being the most realistic gradual tanner. The color seems to have an olive undertone instead of orange, ensuring more natural looking bronze skin.APPLICATION:The lotion is darkly tinted so you see exactly how it's applying. Take note that if it looks uneven during this time you had better fix it or else it will end up looking just as bad once it sets. I still recommend using a bit of white lotion mixed in a drop of this stuff for your rough spots like knees and feet, or else it may end up soaking too much color as with most tanning lotions.A note on the dark tint: the tint is there to help you apply, and serve as a visual. It also helps you look much darker. Once you take your first shower after using the product, you will appear much lighter because the tint will wash away. So don't be afraid if the water turns dark brown and you look much lighter after stepping out. Personally I like washing off the dark tint as soon as possible.LONGEVITY:If you make sure to exfoliate properly before using, it will last a few days. To avoid looking splotchy and to make sure it comes off evenly, you have to continue exfoliating well every day. While this means it wont' last too long, at least it doesn't fade unevenly.SMELL:The main reason I stop using self tanners is because of the bad smell all tanning chemicals have. There seems to be no way around this. Sun Labs has a lovely smell when first applying, smells like cherry, but after an hour or so the perfume fades and the typical self-tanning smell arrives. It's much more subtle than any other tanner I've tried, which is a huge plus. However, it's still there. I have sensitive smell and I get very self-conscious when I smell it and usually stop using the tanner for a while. It's even worse when I go to the gym. A lot of people have had good luck with the smell, but there is a risk it won't work well for you. If this is a determining factor, I suggest trying a sample and going from there. I can only use this product every once in a while before the smell defeats me and I decide being pale for the summer is better than smelling weird.OVERALL:Three stars for being one of the best options out there right now. Great application and color. Average longevity. Smell is the most subtle from what I've used, but is still there and bothers me enough to be turned off from using it after a while. If you're desperate for something that looks natural and is easy to use, give this a shot! Just beware if you're sensitive to smells."
105369,2,I was very disappointed in this product. I paid for a premium fragrance to give us that real Christmas tree smell and got something that smells just like the cheap pine bathroom deodorizers of years ago.
55229,0,"Both my sister in law and wife got these as gifts and their opinons were very similar. If you got the pimple at just the right time you had some success and it sped up the healing process, other times it just was a waste. The price would suggest a better than 50% success rate and for that reason I would stay away from the Zeno Acne."
202413,0,"I have been using this at least once a day (sometimes twice when I remember) on my breasts, hips and stomach. I don't like the smell. At all. Neither does my husband. It has sort of a stale citrus smell to it. The other problem with it is that it doesn't spread that well, so you wind up having to use a lot of it. I have to use one pump per breast and probably 4 more on my stomach/sides/hips each time, so it goes fast. It is greasy, but it's oil, so that's to be expected.I like that it's all safe for the baby and so far I'm stretch mark free, but I will update this when I'm further along and let you know how it goes.UPDATE: I'm now 38 weeks pregnant and, knock on wood, (haha) still no stretch marks! There looks like one MIGHT be developing on my hip, but there are absolutely none on my stomach, breasts, or thighs.Please keep in mind I use a TON of this stuff. I have gone through 5 bottles so far this pregnancy. Just ordered another bottle! I started using it right at the beginning, though, and I use it twice a day. It takes a lot of the oil to cover me as I've gained going on 40 pounds and it doesn't really spread out. I still don't like the smell (it smells like stale oranges, like I said before) but I haven't been itchy a single time this whole pregnancy and so far it has prevented stretch marks (and I have gained a lot of weight - 40 pounds, approx).Some people get stretchmarks AFTER pregnancy when their skin tries to go back down so I'm going to keep using it for a couple of months after I have her. So far, so good! If I make it to the end with no stretchmarks, I'm changing this to 5 stars! Hard to say since some people get them right at the end or after they have the baby but I'm impressed so far."
16007,1,"In my first experience with St. Ives I thought, """"gosh, this is too abrasive."""" I continued and rinsed my face as recommended. My face felt very smooth. I tried it the next day and the abrasiveness didn't bother me. I've had a problem with blackheads since I was a teen, and that was many years ago. I've had to go to a dermatologist to have them removed -- not very pleasant. I've been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for a few days now and have noticed the change in my face. My skin seems to have a shine that I never had before. The blackheads are actually disappearing. I'll continue to use this product. I wasn't impressed with the smell, but I guess that wouldn't matter if you get good results. I would highly recommend this product to everyone."
103360,0,"This smells like Raid bug spray when my wife first sprays it on... neither of us care for that bug spray smell. Yet, after about an hour it mellows out to a really nice ""non-bug spray"" scent that we both like. So, it ends up _good_, but it starts out strange! Won't be trying this one again, it's okay... but not one of our favorites."
168896,1,The product was great and helped clear up my acne. It also helped to reduce the dark spots that previous breakouts left behind. I will be ordering this product again.
230019,0,"I like the size and shape of this product, however it did not seem to get to the 450 degrees it said it would. It also has small cracks/crevices along the edges and when I use this product, it pulls strands of hair out of my head that get caught in these and it happens EVERY time. It seems to straighten ok, but to get the best results, I guess I will have to buy a professional model."
120513,1,"This is the best foundation I have ever tried. I have a tendency to get red skin, which Youngblood eliminates completely without looking unnatural. The first time I applied it I thought it made my pores show, but I realised it was just a matter of working it into the skin correctly with the right Youngblood brush. Doing so, my skin appears flawless. Highly recommended!"
152120,0,"Today's date is April, 20, 2011. I started using Hesh Brahmi Amla Herbal hair oil mixed with the Hesh Shikakai Herbal Hair for about two weeks now. About every few nights I mix the two oils together and massage my scalp with my figer tips (not my nails) and then I put on a silk bonnet.So far I have mixed feelings about this product. I first purchased this product because of all the high reviews it recieved. One of the things I like about this product is the way my hair feels in the morning when I wake up. I find using this oil,and massaging it into my scalp helps my hair to be more managable when I wake up. And I don't have to put to much work in styling it. And it also helps stop breakage So that's a major plus. As of right now it is way to soon to tell if this oil does all the things its promised to do like grow hair which is the main reason I ordered it. Since healthy hair grows 1/2 per month I expect six months to pass before I see major results.I'm also doing other things to help in hair growth like taken Biotin/ Nioxin hair supplements and getting my dead ends trimed, as of right now my hair is shoulder length. The Brahmi Oil can be a bit messy and it tends to drip down your neck and eye if you apply too much in your hair the smell is also a little over powering. I'm in college and I live with few other girls and none of them are a fan of Brahmi. But Beauty is pain, so I will keep using the oil for six months before I write another review. And doing any type of oil treatment is time consuming so if you don't have much time on your hands I would not recommand oil treatments."
206017,1,The product arrived on time and it was exactly what I was looking for and exactly like the photo. The packaging was great and I love it.
153543,2,"I did not purchase this product or have I used this vendor before but, I do recognize the image being for this product. It is actually from a website called sheabutterhut.com...unless....this website actually stole it from this vendor. Not sure just thought I would make a note of it. I only gave it 1 star because I had to pick something in order to post my comment :)"
245473,1,"I'm very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.thanks God bless"
220192,0,"I bought this because it was recommended by my sister-in-law and hair-brushing time with my daughter has always been a battle. I had hoped this would make it a little better, and it has to a degree. When my daughter's hair is dry, this brush pulls less than any of the other brushes I've ever used. There is still some snagging, but not nearly as much as there used to be. My daughter has thick, fine, curly hair. When my daughter's hair is wet - this brush is just as bad about pulling as any other brush on wet hair. I won't be using the ""wet"" brush on her wet hair ever again.Since it's also labeled for adult use, I've tried it on my very thick, curly hair and found it didn't work very well. I'll stick to thick-tined combs."
99164,1,"Although it is not one of the more lasting fragrances, it does smell good on my 13 year old son. More suited for everyday wear like for work, not where you want to make a big 'splash'. Hence, it is good for the price"
154397,0,"I have no complaints, but for a twenty something dollar towel it could have been at least less thick, I guess. Packing was ok. Just like a t-shirt."
63685,0,"This lotion is wonderful smelling. It is great for your skin too. Its soothing for sensitive or irritated skin, works great at improving complextion, I mean, this list could go on and on. But for only 2 ounces for the price, this lotion is spendy. A small dab is all I would normally need for any other lotion but this formula would always leave me feeling dry after 15 minutes (its VERY light) so I knew I needed to apply more for my skin type to be properly moisturized. Which normally would be fine, as the results were great and all, but soon I discovered that 2 ounces wouldn't last me long. I found myself going through these so often that it just wasn't financially worth it for me anymore, not when I could buy a different brand that would give me great results too for the same price...and get a 6oz container that would last much longer. Plus, a few years back, the formula was changed so that now it is not as ""natural"" and chemical free as it used to be before for the same price. So I no longer use this lotion anymore."
133005,2,"The perfume did not arrive intact. Almost half was gone, and saturated the sealed box. The shipper never returned my call, either."
22387,1,"I have used Bumble and Bumble shampoo and conditioner for well over 10 years. It gives my hair a beautiful, soft, blonde color without being brassy. Very natural looking. I use it every day. It smells nice, lathers nicely, and makes my hair really easy to manage. Very pretty color! My actual hair color is very light grey. If you discontinue use, the color just gradually fades away. No roots. Ever!"
212475,0,"For a men's scent, this would be okay, but it's a bit too masculine for a woman, in my opinion. My husband asked me why I felt compelled to wear men's cologne. Not good. Ladies, pass this one up. Guys, it's all on you."
217305,0,"The kit includes everything you need, and is easy to use (once you get the hang of the wax) Worth the buy."
131097,0,"I have shoulder length hair that I am trying to grow out after cutting off my long hair. I did a ton of research on this product including watching some honest reveiws on youtube and reading about a 100 reviews on different sites. So here is mine:First of all the hair is actually really beautiful and if you add a little powder to it, or dry shampoo, it takes away the shine, but even without it, the shininess isn't bad if you flat iron your hair with a shine product. The color was pretty and realistic and almost a perfect match (R4). The hair did look absolutely real next to my own. But that is the only good thing I can say about this.About the cap- I have a huge head, and a long hairline, but even I couldn't get this to fit right since the cap is ENORMOUS. I put the extension all the way at the top of my head as if it were a half wig, and even then the bottom wasn't tight and still sagged a little.The hair is thin- I have extremely thick hair, and I figured this may be a problem but thought I'd try it anyway. Well, it doesn't work. Even with only the front maybe 3 inches of my hair out of the cap, and my hair flat ironed to be flat and smooth, it was really obvious that I have way more hair than this extension peice. If I put my hair in front of me (as the ad pic of Jessica shows), then there were only a few thin strands on my back with a lot more of my natural hair on the top. And if I put the hair down my back, then it looked fake from the front. Because of the difference in volume, it was so obvious it was fake. If only they would add more hair, I probably could have gotten this to work.I would recommend this for people with shoulder length or longer hair that is very thin/fine and ONLY if it is priced under $40. Otherwise, it's a huge waste of money. It is definately not worth the $90 I've seen it listed on some sites/beauty supply stores. Also, make sure you buy from a retailer that will accept a return just in case you can't use it. I didn't do this, and now I'm stuck with a pile of hair I can't use."
26030,0,"I bought this gel based on the large amount of positive reviews! Huge mistake. At 25+ dollars, that's about 20 bucks more than I'd be willing to spend on it again! Going back to my Axe hair gel until I find something else worth trying!"
218440,0,"I do like this product but my hair gets greasy, very quickly. Makes my hair look healthy, not frizzy, with alot of body which I love but within 12 hours I need to wash my hair again. Maybe I just haven't tried the right kind yet so I am gonna keep trying because this product great just not the perfect one for me yet."
25376,2,it did not worth the money paid for it. it was not a good a choice and I will not buy it again
52026,0,"Some describe this product as natural, however these products contain parabens and other preservatives. Spend a couple more bucks and get some California Baby products."
53894,2,I bought these rollers and they barely heat up or curl my hair. In 2 seconds my hair was completely flat. Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.
118816,0,"i've been too busy to use this 2x a day, probably used it twice a day 6 days and used it another 6 times once per day. after 3 wks i was thinking of sending it back when i went to cover an age spot and realized it was 90% gone! so i decided to keep it and see what else it will help. also, dermawand is cheaper at amazon."
195750,1,"Hubby says this headband works better than many others he has purchased. We don't know what in the product makes it work, but it absorbs water and does the job!"
60455,0,"It's perfect for french manicure, but for use alone doesn't work, is so clear; it's like clear polish with a little shade."
155615,0,"This book was recommended by a friend. It does have a lot of good information in it, but I found it hard to get past the preaching. If you are not a ""churchy"" person, it can really put you off.I'd love to see a version of this book that concentrated on the psychology and correcting the problem, and not on religion."
196662,1,"I do like this straightner because it's a lot faster to use than my wet-2-straight iron, but the result is the same. To be honest, I haven't seen where it's THAT much better. I actually do like the fact that it only has one setting making for less confusion, and I have terribly thick hair, so I would have to have the highest level anyway. I guess it would work wonders on someone with average hair, or maybe I need more practice with it, but for now, I only like it, not love it. I CERTAINLY wouldn't have bought it from a salon at their high price though, and if I something happens to this one, I might consider getting another brand."
85333,2,"I was desperately seeking a great volumizing shampoo;I thought I would try this well known brand and am soooo disappointed. Not only does it not volumize my hair, but I started finding more of my thinning hair in the shower drain!!! YIKES! OJON IS THE BEST! DO NOT waste your money on this one."
217248,2,"I have been waxing various parts of myself for 10 years, and this is the worst wax ever! I tried w/ the pre wash and oil, w/o the oil and just the pre wash, and w/o either and just soap and i literally counted the hairs it actually pulled out, under 10. I even stood in front of the AC unit to dry my skin out, and then applied and stood in front of it again to cool the wax, and it did nothing. Im going on vacation tomorrow and its too late to do anything other than shave. Im furious. THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL!!!"
90861,1,"I have used this product for more than a dozen years it is, in my opinion, and excellent cologne"
38626,0,"I didn't like this as much as I wanted to after reading the other reviews. It has a nice scent, but it smells very harsh to me, so I have been blending it with some almond oil to cut it down. I am a big patchouli lover, and I am still looking for the perfect one."
30743,0,Is nice enough but doesn't have the signature &#34;cotton candy&#34; smell that I was looking for from a Pink Sugar product. A lot of vanilla pulls through which is nice but not what I was looking for. It smells kind of common and not like the &#34;signature&#34; scent that I am familiar with from Pink Sugar.
83382,2,"I only use one tool in this whole kit and I spent over $32.00 on it. This was not a great buy, sorry seller."
174623,0,"I bought the Opium collection as a mother's day gift to myself. I was soexcited to receive it as I've purchased the cologne or spray many timesin the past. The perfume of course smelled awesome as usual. However,I was sadly disappointed with the shower gel and lotion. It hardly smellslike Opium, more like some kind of a mans scent! I've tryed to use it butam very reluctant and disappointed as it does not smell like Opium.Ladies beware! In the future, go to a store and smell first before youbuy! I'm sorry Opium makers, the bath gel and lotion are not what theyare expected to be. But your cologne is absolutely, incredibly AWESOME!I will always love and purchase Opium cologne or spray. It is amazing!"
219618,0,It would have been better if it was thicker. Also I ordered seven and only got one that was a different color.
79724,1,"This WAS my absolute favorite leave-in hair conditioner of all time. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.Aveda does not currently have a similar product to replace Elixir.Hang Straight (a lotion) was the product the salon recommended for folks with straight hair, but it is a styling product, not a conditioner. Color Conserve Sun Protector (a foam) was the other product the salon said might be a closer replacement because it has detanglers in it."
97337,1,"I've been wanting this for 20 years. Why did I wait so long? I'll never forget the effect it had on me then and while said effect has been somewhat diminished now, it's still pretty nice. Perfume, however, is STRONG and I'm not used to it, so I use it sparingly. Which is great 'cause it'll last me a long time."
82081,2,"I bought this for my dry cracked feet from reading reviews. I certainly won't be buying it again. It is extremely watery and smells like an odd mixture of medicinal licorice. Totally disappointed...not sure how this is supposed to heal dry cracked heels when it is like applying stinky water to your feet. I haven't noticed any better results than from any other lotion...and I later it on at bedtime and put on socks...once it is gone, I will go back to any other lotion I many pick out at the store-anything has got to smell better!"
187563,2,"Sea Breeze has been my favorite Essie color, and since it such an old color, most stores no longer carry it. So when I discovered it listed with this seller on Amazon, I was pleased. Unfortunately, the polish that I received was nothing like the original Sea Breeze that I have so enjoyed. I've simply tossed it rather than go to the trouble of returning it. I DO NOT recommend this product as offered by this seller!!!"
138103,2,I did a blind buy of this OP Juice and I must say it's the worst smell ever for a cologne I tried. I should of listened to one of the negative reviews because this cologne smells like CELERY JUICE on crack.
250224,0,"Having the 3 mirrors and the magnifying mirror are a plus, but the light feature is a total waste. If the light feature is important to you, I would get something else."
149171,0,"Most aspects of this sunblock deserve 5 stars. The texture is amazing, silky. If I have exfoliated recently, it's invisible after being rubbed in. Doesn't burn my eyes. Effective sun protection. Best of all, I haven't had a breakout all summer--even the times I left it on overnight.That's pretty good, right? Ah, but if your skin has dry or flaky patches, you'll need a system. I've never used a moisturizer that doesn't break me out, so I didn't try adding a lotion, but some people have luck with that pairing. Otherwise, exfoliating first solves the problem, but who wants to exfoliate several times a week?Getting it off is a pain. Products strong enough to remove it are too harsh, and I ended up with cracked, peeling face, mid-winter style. (Hence going 2 days before washing it off.) Here's what works for me: I use coconut oil, rub it in. This dissolves the sunblock. Then I wash my face with tea tree oil wash (Body Shop) to remove the coconut oil, rinsing as quickly as possible so that I don't totally kill my skin. Yes, coconut oil is supposed to be highly comedogenic, but I haven't had a breakout, like I said. I use Parachute oil from the local Indian grocer as that's what I had on hand for pre-shampoo deep conditioning.So while it's not perfect, it's the only effective sunblock that hasn't broken me out. If I find something better for the face, I'll still use this on the body. Just hope that nanoparticle cancer thing isn't a thing after all."
205576,1,"I had this perfume before and got it from macy's first as a present.Ever since I fell in love with it. I love perfumes that smell clean/flowery/sweet, not so strong.DKNY delicious is just perfect and affordable here on amazon"
112394,2,This has a very harsh smell and does not smell at all like violets. I was very disappointed with this purchase and do not recommend it.
107641,2,"Tried this recently at Macy's. It had great smell for a small amount sprayed. The one bought from amazon is very diluted so you can hardly smell the fragrance, even if you spray a lot of it on. Amazon delivered the item as expected and on time but I too was disappointed with the product. I suggest you buy this item off the shelf at a department store such as Macy's, JC Penney, etc."
80545,0,"My son has terrible cradle cap and this was recommended by his pediatrician. The shampoo seems to help, but does not get rid of the cradle cap completly. I also think it smells terrible and makes his hair less shiny. My husband doesn't think it smells bad or makes his hair smelly so it might not bother everyone."
106149,2,I love the smell of lemongrass but this was a little overwhelming and the soap seemed to dissolve away to quickly. Lathered up nice and left skin feeling good but fragrance was to strong for me.
101783,0,"If natural ingredients are important to you, for whatever reason, and/or you have skin allergies to some ingredients, this acne treatment system may be for you. It is a set of 3 bottled acne products which are used together as a 3-step facial routine: ""Corrective Cleanser"" (step 1), ""Calming Toner"" (step 2), and ""Controlling Lotion"" (step 3). A sticker on the box said ""Get CLEAR skin in 6 Weeks"" and ""Clinically Proven Effective Formula"".The price is reasonable, especially when compared to competing systems of acne treatment. It's something you can try for yourself without a huge price or a subscription hassle.What sets this acne treatment apart from the others is that it does NOT have some common but irritating ingredients that are used in many (most?) of the others.I have uploaded images of the ingredient lists from the box. They are not easy to read; but the box isn't easy to read either, due to tiny font used on the ingredient lists. (To see the images, look underneath the main photo of the product, click on the ""see all x customer images"" link)This does not contain parabens. Parabens are very common; they show up in almost all skin lotions and creams, and in other acne treatment ""systems"". Parabens trigger rashes for many people with sensitive skin, including me.I do not see benzyl (or benzyol) peroxide on the ingredient list either. Benzyl peroxide is another potential irritant found in some competing acne products, and has the additional hassle of stained towels, etc., requiring extra care.This set does not contain PAPBA (nor any other sunscreen), which is not surprising. The directions recommend, if you are using their acne treatment system, that you ""avoid unnecessary sun exposure"" and put on some type of sunscreen before you go outside. I'm guessing the product causes sun-sensitivity, at least temporarily.The only ""active"" ingredient listed on the box is salicylic acid 1%, which is a lower percentage compared to some acne treatments; on the other hand that means it is less irritating, which I appreciate. The salicylic acid 1% is in the step 1 cleanser, and in the step 3 lotion.Tea tree oil (Melaleuca Altemifolia) is listed as an ingredient for each of the 3 bottles. I consider tea tree oil to be an ""active"" ingredient when used in skin or hair (scalp) products, although the FDA may not yet recognize it as such (maybe FDA does not permit it to be listed as an ""active"" ingredient?). The paper enclosed in the box (the Nature's Gate Organics Natural Results Acne Treatment System box) says that ""encapsulated Tea Tree Leaf Oil is particularly beneficial to acne-prone skin and helps reduce redness"". On the other hand, I've heard that some people have a sensitivity to tea tree oil.By the way, ""tea tree oil"" does not seem like a true ""oil"" to me; it does not make skin oily; I don't know how tee tree oil got its folk name; it seems a misnomer. Some herbal ""experts"" claim that tea tree oil has some mild (or weak) anti-microbial properties when used on the skin. I was already inclined to believe some of the claims for tea tree oil, since I've been using a foot spray with tea tree oil for the past 1-2 years.Another unusual feature of this acne treatment system is that it contains extracts from about 12-20 different plants, and most or all of them are footnoted as ""certified organic"".On the box, Nature's Gate describes ""Oligopeptide-10"" their patented combination of ""15 naturally occurring amino acids"". Oligopeptide-10 is included in the step 2 ""Calming Toner"" bottle, and the step 3 ""Controlling Lotion"" bottle. The box says ""Oligopeptide-10 and Salicylic Acid help neutralize pro-inflammatory bacteria ..."" ; that sounds good to me, but I don't have the scientific background to evaluate the claim.This acne treatment system has a subtle scent that smells vaguely like green plants; it is not a strong scent. If does not smell flowery or perfume-ish; and the scent is neither feminine nor masculine; just a slight scent of neutral botanicals.Cons: I wish the ingredients were listed in a larger font. Trying to read them is giving me a headache. It may sound trivial to others, but for someone like me, with so many skin allergies and sensitivities, those ingredient lists are so important. However, this seems to be a problem with about 95% of the products in any grocery store, drugstore, and with 95% of all cosmetics and other toiletries; the readability problem is not limited to just this brand, and this font size may be a little larger than typical.The painfully small font size gives the impression that companies don't want us to fully examine the ingredients list. A company like Nature's Gate, with their fine product line, which has far better ingredients than average (at least from my allergy-prone viewpoint), seems likely to profit if they were to target the customer market segments consisting of people who consider the ingredients important.I have 2 types of skin problems: (1) stubborn acne, and (2) skin allergies or sensitivities to ingredients often found in skin care products. I've had allergic reactions (hives) and/or sensitivities (rashes) to many lotions, creams, sunscreens, and acne treatments, and also some make-up, scented laundry detergent, Dawn blue liquid dishwashing detergent. I have not yet figured out all the ingredients that make my skin react. Thus, trying a new product is an adventure. I was glad to see that the specific chemicals that I know are definitely a problem for me (and probably many other people) are not contained in this product - no parabens, no PABA.When I first tried this acne treatment system, my skin immediately looked so much smoother. I was surprised at the quick improvement. Unfortunately, several hours later I had a delayed reaction, and got a rash and itchy hives.Even though I will not be able to continue use of this product, I still think it would be a good treatment system for many other people. My husband will be trying it next."
112574,0,"About what I expected. A good product, which does what it's supposed to do. Correct flexibility in ""teeth"". Seems overpriced, for a piece of extruded plastic. As others have noted, the hand strap is too easily detached upon use. I'm not aware of a similar alternative."
189918,0,"this wasn't some miracle treatment for me, just a really stinky soap. i don't have psoriasis or anything like that but i do have dry itchy skin and i guess it helped, a little. i mostly wanted to see if it would help clear up some of my acne because some people say it helped with that but it didn't for me. i won't be purchasing this again and i don't like coming out of the shower feeling stinker than when i went in lol"
104062,0,"My hair is a cross between light brown and dirty blonde. I really wanted lighter hair but after using this stuff my hair has turned kind of a brassy color. Not very pretty. I'm hoping if I use it more it will turn more blonde, but I might end up just getting my hair highlighted. I gave it three stars because it DOES work, I just think it's more suited for lighter blondes. I'm disappointed because I used to be a blonde when I was younger which is why I thought it would work for me."
152029,0,"I like the material but these hair towels have way too much elastic. It actually makes them hard to control and presses on the ears. The little rope ring to loop on the button is on the inside!?1? Have to dig it out when your head is upside down, it makes no sense. OK, but no way the best ever as claimed."
122253,2,This doesn't smell like the perfume you get in a fine department store. Smells like a generic or watered down version.
246902,0,"The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package. However the Body Lotion and the Perfume are in good condition.Please check the items condition before shipping to customer."

120324,1,This is a great product! Really helps with the frizz; it is enriched with Aloe-E. I will never go back to my old conditioner!
37787,0,A little too sweet and feminine for me and I am going to give it as a gift to someone coz. it is a lil sweet for me but definitely some ultra feminine types would love this product.
30107,1,I went to the dermatologist because of dandruff. She suggested trying a variety of shampoos. I liked the dermatolgists suggestion. Try a variety of shampoos until you find one that works if you have dandruff. T-Gel worked. It's now the only one I use. It may not work for everyone.
211005,2,"A few hours after trying this mascara, my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning. It got progressively worse before improving. It was supposed to be hypoallergenic! It is horrible. I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from."
242102,0,"I bought this in two colors - the Natural, and this, the Rosy. I really like the Natural, but the Rosy not so much. I mean, it's fine, and I plan to wear it - but the color is less natural (duh) than the Natural. I'm a caramel brown African American woman, and it looks a little clownish on my face unless I control it really well. Unfortunately, it's a rather thin gel and runnier than I expected, so it's difficult to control just how much you put on. It's very easy to apply too much, so you kind of have to dab in layers and blend until you get the right amount. Also, as was mentioned this does NOT last long at all. You'll be doing a touch up two hours after you apply it; it slides right off your face. Still, it's nice for a little flush of color and for a very easy morning application if you don't have the time or desire to fuss over powder blush. I just recommend the Natural instead of this."
147786,2,Ins not a 24 hr deodorant.....i will not buy again
39943,0,"The nail polish was worth the cheap price, and worked well for a night out, but didnt last more than two days. I used it with a top coat and it looked great the first day, but started flaking off on the second."
57555,0,The Lotion itself is wonderful. I tried it thanks to a loyal friend and ordered it myself later. However the biggest desappoitment is the quality of the nozzle cap. It broke rapidly and the dispenser device is cheap and not very efficient. Too bad. It ruins the product and the whole concept. I will go back to my favorite Sun God.
175096,0,"This is a beautifully bottled perfume and I liked the fragrance when I first sprayed it on me, but as time went on wearing it, the chemistry in my skin changed to the point that it became too strong for me.I love the bottle and will use it for show with a few other's on display."
140491,0,"I really like the smell of this perfume, but it doesn't last long. Not sure if it's just me, would recommend as a sexy perfume for night."
184184,2,I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase.
235088,0,I felt that the glitter spray was so fine that it was barely noticeable in my daughter's hair. We kept adding more and more. She was supposed to be a star and we wanted her really glittery. It didn't work as we wanted it to. We wanted something more theatrical. Perhaps if you are using this for going out or a wedding it would be more subdued.
173256,0,Smells pretty much like air freshener or fabric softener. Some of the other floral attars I've purchased from Attar Bazaar smell like air freshener as well. I'm wondering if the oils are derived from natural plants or are these synthetic fragrance oils. It looks like I'm going to end up using it as a home fragrance oil instead of a perfume.
149213,2,"At first I was so thrilled with this product, but after using it a couple of times, I realized the scent is completely gone...this cannot be real Joy...my last bottle of Joy brought compliments at the end of the day when I used it at the beginning of the day...this does not last until I am out of the house...very sorry I spent so much money on something that I do not believe is real....Is it too late to return it??? I hate that I paid so much for this product.Amazon has since credited me for this disappointment, thank you, Amazon"
214338,2,"I can see this working for long hair, but for a guy with short hair (about 2"") it just didn't work for me. It was ok, but the SLIGHTEST amount of styling product and my hair gunked up.My other ""issue"" is the $8.50 shipping/handling. On top of $24... ouch."
113260,2,"I loved the hair dryer until it broke...only lasted for 5 months....there is no more hot air coming out, only cold air....I read reviews about this product and heard about this problem, took my chance--- and wasn't on the lucky side! Don't buy this product, guys!"

3228,2,"I HATED this shampoo. My dermatologist recommended that I purchase this after having problems with my scalp. I used this shampoo and it was EXTREMELY DRYING to my hair. It left white residue in my hair and on my scalp. After the shampoo left the white residue in my hair it was also sticky.....I then had to wash my hair with a sulfate shampoo to remove the residue. My hair is natural and the key ingredient in this line is Sodium Hydroxide one of the main ingredients in Perms for black people and when you are natural you do not want that stuff on your hair because it breaks down the protein in our hair. I was so panic stricken and never used this product again. I had to return this shampoo and the conditioner. When my scalp flare up I now just use what I have always used and that is Neutroogena T-Gel shampoo, it too is extremely drying but less drying than the FREE&Clear line. I don't think that this line is hidious to African American/Bi-racial textured type hair."

201319,0,"This is more of a packaging review than a product review, as I received an empty bottle. But perhaps there will be something here for you to consider.I received (or rather didnt receive) my Peppermint and Rosemary body wash in a completely soaked, mushy cardboard box, on my front porch in a plastic USPS tray! It had completely leaked out! The bottle had no ""seal"" that you tear off before use. Just has a flip top like every shampoo and body wash bottle has. Perhaps the cap was loose. Immaterial to me now. Whats worse, I ordered some specialty peanuts in a cardboard ""tin"" that came also in that box. Soaked through also, and had to throw away. But that is probably my fault for ordering these items at the same time.....I guess I could have rubbed the box on my body to get some soap on me. The product smells wonderfull. I am sure the postal delivery vehicle is gonna smell really good for a few days! But I cant review how it feels on my skin, other than my hands holding the mushy box. But my hands did smell really nice.I am sure the bodywash is an excellent item. I just didnt get the opportunately to try. So I am giving 3 stars, because I am sure the postal delivery guy will say how nice his vehicle has smelled, and how good the box smelled in the short time I had it. I am taking away 2 stars because I feel the bottle should have had a tear-off ""seal"" to peel off before using."
223394,0,I have not worn this scent for a few years. Since I started wearing it again I have gotten many compliments. Only complaint is the scent does not last.
108220,0,"I was so excited when UPS delivered my package today! I thought $47.14 was a great price for a CAROLINA HERRERA For Women By CAROLINA HERRERA Eau de Parfum Spray in 3.4 oz size, as posted in Amazon. I just opened the box and it is NOT Eau de PARFUM, but Eau de TOILETTE! Geesh! I was so disappointed!!! Eau de toilette dissipates much faster; Eau de Parfum stays on your skin much longer. Needless to say, I must return :(In going through the return process, I contacted Amazon Chat, and the lady was very helpful - for which I rate Amazon 5 STARS!"
174737,1,"I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers. I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it. I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32. After using it once I am SO happy with it. It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with). My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron. I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4"" Flat IronRemington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4"" Wide Plates, and LOVE it just as much. Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil) I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it's smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity. It's amazing, I can't see any reason to spend more."
160497,0,"I keep my hair very short, so there's no reason to shell out $20 just to have someone run a clipper over my head. That was my logic in buying this, and for my haircut it works great. But for anything more complex, bring some experience. Maybe my wife just lacks natural talent for this but the instructional DVD did nothing to improve her fading and trimming (we just don't try too hard now). It's just not that helpful. Also, it's a big pain to get everything back into the case. Just look at the picture: lots of stuff, tiny case. If I were back in the market for a clipper, I would get a simpler set."
212315,2,"As a huge fan of the Original Gray Flannel, in which I still have a half bottle of the oil version (you know, the REAL version). Unfortunately, I must say this is the true ""WATERED DOWN"" version! What a waste of money. Sure I would have expected this to smell somewhat as the original, and yes, I did expect it to last as long as everyone on the reviews were raving about. Such over exaggeration. I don't care if it's a Toilette Spray, which I can understand why it's called that, because it must be for the toilet.This is truly a waste of money and time. This is NOT Grey Flannel, it is a poor wanna be clone which is watered down and lasts as long as the minute you spray it on. If you read my reviews you will notice I do not give props to garbage, however I do give props to that which is worth the value, and hype.Do yourself a favor, if you want a good smelling spray that lasts, keep looking because this ain't the one!"
163019,0,"it is not as efficient as I had thought but it helps a bit. you need to put it over the acne many times a day not only twice, otherwise you will not see any effect at all."

22057,0,"This seems like a great hair dryer. I would consider it for home use in the future. However, it is too big for my liking for travel purposes. I ended up returning it. I can't see taking up this much space in a small suitcase. I wish it were smaller and lighter and I would love it for travel!"
248276,1,It works great for my moustache and it was delivered within a few days of me placing the order. What else can you ask for?
217095,2,I ordered this hairspray cause it was advertised as Freeze Super Hold ..what I got was Light Control..Im not going to send it back ..to much of a hassle...This hairspray is Hard to find and I was excited to find it and dissappointed when I opened it.I just hope they change the advertisement so it doesnt happen to someone elese.I guess I will keep looking.
21044,0,"It smells ok, a little generic to be honest but my biggest gripe is that it doesnt last long on hubby's clothes, 5 minutes tops, it's like it's been watered down drastically. For a few bucks more you could get a Nautica blue or classic EDT."
41756,2,"I purchased a nail polish from Zoya's website several months ago. I tested it on just one finger (my thumb nail), it was a tiny bit clumpy, I just figured it needed to be shaken more next time before using it. I sealed up the bottle and put it with the rest of the polish I have.Fast forward to this past weekend, I tried using the same polish and this time it was EXTREMELY chunky. It didn't go on well at all and looked horrible. I shook it like crazy and tried it on another finger, and it's still awful.so, I e-mailed Zoya through their ""contact us"" link on the webpage and waited patiently for a response. Today, they tell me to get rejuvenating drops and try using that, that I obviously didn't put the cover on tight enough (cause clearly I have no idea how to close a nail polish bottle?). After expressing my disappointment in their awful customer service (and hence giving them yet another chance to make it right with me), the woman forwarded my e-mail to her supervisor who then told me that I'm basically out of luck cause I didn't report a 'flaw' in the first ten days.Skip this product all together, it's not as great as it's price tag says it should be, I'd rather have formaldehyde on my nails and deal with a company that stands behind their products 100%."
112884,2,nice for the price but way too hard. more of a back scratcher. People say the head keeps falling off so i just super glued it before using it. You can tell it was poorly made. works ok.

205646,0,"It smells really good, but doesn't last me all day. The smell fades fast. not sure if it's just this brand."
233072,0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
96168,1,"My wife loves this perfume, and gets it over and over. That is about all that needs to be said. I bought it for her as a gift."
18697,0,"After a few uses of this shampoo by both of my daughters, I wondered if maybe they weren't using enough of the shampoo, or just not taking their time. When I touched their hair, it still felt straw-like from the chlorine. So I helped my youngest wash her hair the next time she went swimming, but found it really wasn't doing the job of removing the chlorine. The shampoo smells great! But what I found is that regular clarifying shampoo has worked the best (as it was suggested by my hairdresser)!"
86855,2,"It does taste terrible and it was a pretty good deterrent for daytime, but we really needed something to get her through the night without sucking her thumb and this did not work. Painted it just before bedtime at 8:30 and when we checked on her at 11:30, the thumb was firmly embedded in her mouth. She did complain of a bad taste in her mouth in the morning, but that wasn't enough to stop it when she was sleeping."
229844,0,"This is a fairly mediocre product. The overall design appears to be easy to handle, but I don't believe it does a very effective job as a pumice stone. Although the idea of the brush on the backside of the stone is interesting, I'd say it's not in a great position for scrubbing under your nails."
114601,2,"I wouldn't buy this product again. The shine was absolutely fantastic. The product peels off as the day wears on. By the next morning, most of it had come off. I was very disappointed in the product."
240313,2,"I also used this for a trip to belize. I think the sunblock worked fine but the bug repellant did not work at all. I returned from my trip absolutely covered in bug bites. Plus, this smells atrociously sweet. And it did not close properly. I had to wrap it in ziploc bags and it would still manage to spill everywhere. Not recommended."
97367,0,"I bought this perfume years ago for the first time and I loved the smell but what I most remember is the intensity of the smell and I could not believe how long the smell lasted. I bought it online this time because it is a lot cheaper than in the store but after a few times using it, I found out that the smell does not last as long. It is the same smell but the intensity is gone. Next time I will buy it at the same location I did years ago."

104856,0,produt ok a power puff weighs almost nothing yet i was charged a large shipihng and handling
65829,0,The color is a very pretty vibrant red. I had bought it to go with my NARS Red Lizard lipstick. I wasn't too wow by it. My lips looked a bit cracked after I put it on. Maybe some feathering too. I normally don't wear lip liner or red lipstick! so it might just be me not knowing the techniques.

180354,1,"I have used Revlon ColorStay for years now and won't ever buy any other kind. The color I used initially is not made anymore, but this Everlasting Rum is almost as good. This lipstick will literally stay on all day. I'm not kidding. It is the bomb. I would give it 6 stars if that were an option."
218958,1,I received the item and it was shipped to me very quickly. The item was just as described. Thanks to all.
132134,0,"I don't like the fragrance of this product, and when I bought the product I thought it was fragrance free. Further more the bottles are easy to leak if you lay them down. It's as if you got to keep a lot of these bottles standing(I had three bottles). And these bottles are only good for a couple of uses."
105046,0,I can't really tell if it is working or not. sometimes I look in the mirror and it seems as if the lines are less pronounced but I could just be retaining water because the next day I see them again?????
20101,2,"I got the item but th bottle of the perfume was broken, so I sent an email with pictures saying what happened. They told me to send the item back. I did it, and was informed that the refund is in process. It's been almost two months since then and I still haven't received the money back. So unfortunately I do not recommend this company."
237001,0,"I put this on before I go to bead and when I wake up it's gone. When it dries, it dries as a powder which is why it doesn't stay on. It'd be unrealistic to expect it to stay on but maybe some modifications should be made so the lotion stays on for a bit longer. I don't see how the lotion could help shrink pimples when it only stays on for less than two hours.I find that this works best with pimples that already have a white tip. Put it on when you get home from work so it can work on your blemishes as you're up and about."
69245,0,"Smells good. The Pheremone deal is overated. Actually it doesnt work at all. Have tried night in and night out , but it has had no affect on my wife. It does smell good to me though."

63482,1,"I only use Aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. My hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. I use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. I've tried the other ""Dry Hair"" products and the Island Naturals and White Camellia left my hair too soft or oily and I didn't like the smell of the Desert Herb as much as I like the Honeysuckle Rose. I use the GPB conditioner at home because I have soft water there and the Honeysuckle Rose can make my hair too soft. A recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. Thank you Aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!"

168789,0,"My hair is frizzy/curly/wavy and kind of unruly, and my only requirement for a product is to soften and tame. I like the way this makes my hair feel and it styles great, but my skin hates this product. I tend to be oily and by mid-afternoon, every time I use this stuff, my head itches and my scalp and neck break out in zits. I scratch my head so much that any hair style I had has turned into a bird's nest and I look like a feral child. If you don't have sensitive skin, by all means try it. I keep going back to it because I don't like the idea of tossing a half-full bottle, then I try it again and regret it. When I get home tonight it's going in the trash."
162113,2,"Based on mostly positive reviews I purchased this hair dryer - usually the reviews on Amazon are on target - not this time. This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:1. The night light is way too bright.2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!! Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me. It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).Good luck shopping!"
119960,1,"My dermatologist told me to us Cetaphil twice daily for my dry skin. The local price for it has been steadily increasing. I tried a house brand that claimed to be comparable for a lower price. The texture of the house brand lotion was unpleasant when compared to Cetaphil. Other national brands I have tried either had an undesireable odor, unpleasant texture and/or just did not seem to work. It was great to find that Amazon carrys Cetaphil at about the same low price as house brands."
47980,0,"I have very long, thick wavy hair that gets oily at the roots 12 hours after I wash it. I can't wash my hair daily because it dries it out severely, so I shampoo every other day. I sprayed the dry shampoo when my hair begun to get oily, and it did take the oil out, but I needed to spray more probably 5 or 6 hours later. It also leaves residue in your hair but it's easy to shake or brush out. I also needed quite a bit of the product to do the job. I switched back to using baby powder because the baby powder keeps the oil at bay for a good 24 hours without re-application. I would continue to use this product, but it's not practical for me to carry around the can in my purse and use it when I'm out and about."
100271,1,"I use this product a couple times per week along with Wild Growth Oil to moisturize my scalp. After clarifying or shampooing my hair, this combination keeps my scalp from being too dry. During the week, I use it on areas that I feel like are too dry. This product is amazing! Not only does it keep my scalp healthly, it's paved the way for my hair to grow tremendously! I get so many compliments on how my hair has grown so much. I've even told my famiy members about the product and they've began to use it! I will definitely continue to use it! It works!"
26820,1,I ordered this for my brother and he loved it. Its has a very pleasing fragrance. I specifically love the bottle cover. I would definitely recommend this one.
87157,2,I bought this thinking that it would be a fab conditioner! Instead I found that it made my hair feel bristly and not conditioned at all. I would always end up using a REAL conditioner anyways because I want my hair to feel soft. I liked the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo but I would never spend money on the conditioner again.
75276,0,"I'm always looking for products to enhance shine and improve the condition of my frizzy/wavy hair. Honestly, my hair might have been a tad softer afterwards, but I was aiming for more silkiness than I got. I get the same results out of coconut oil or a deep conditioner."
212344,1,This product is designed to strengthen your nails. It is fantastic. I use it everyday and rarely get a chip or break.
122086,1,"I used a shampoo that had a built in conditioner,but my hair still seemed to be fly away. This provides great conditioner, but be careful not to over apply it."
242928,0,"I bought this cleanser when they had a big promo event at the Philosophy counter. After using it for a few days, it didn't feel like anything special. I couldn't tell the difference between this and drugstore brand I bought in an emergency when the airline lost my luggage. I liked that there was virtually no scent that I could notice. The texture was smooth and creamy, but my face feels neither good nor bad after use. It just feels like an average cleanser. The store gave me a full refund, but the hassle wasn't worth it."
231026,2,This hair dryer was purchased as a Christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years. I could not locate one locally so I order from Amazon. The dryer only worked for a few days. Nothing I do will make it work again. The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.
179877,1,"I was so excited when I got this. I had been looking for a Tiffany Blue color for awhile. I painted my nails with it. It went on very smoothly and it matches my Tiffany & Co stuff perfectly. Love the name also. Its perfect, no complaints."

229952,0,"I bought this as a gift for someone unfamiliar with the brand. I've been using CM since I worked in a high end men's store during high school and love it. This box has a nice sampling of their products, with most of their lines and scents represented. CM is a classic brand and their products are timeless, no fad gels, or harsh scented colognes. Class through and through."
101713,0,"Disappointing. Looks great in the bottle, but it is so sheer going on. Is it supposed to be used as a glitter top coat? The bottle is marked ""Nail Lacquer,"" so I assumed it was a real polish color, but all I really get is a hint of blue with a lot of glitter. I'd hoped it would be bright blue with glitter."
244403,1,This is great for dry skin or a dry patch. It is very soothing once it dries. I used it at a friend house and ordered it from Amazon. It works great on your feet also! Nice price also! Much more expensive in drug store..
183812,2,"Fabulous hair dryer. HOWEVER, after my last trip (got home Sunday 6/13) and my hair dryer did not make it. now loud clunking noises ... obviously something inside broke. warranty? um... not really...exactly how long would you consider average or acceptable to be on the phone for customer service? 10 min? 20 min? how about 53 min before i got ""disconnected"". i only stayed on hold for 22 min the 2nd time before i gave up.LOVE amazon... HATE the customer service (or lack thereof) of BaByliss"

I cannot wear products with mineral oil at all.I cannot say enough about this product! I wish I would have known about it years ago. My skin loves this stuff and is not breaking out - that's a miracle in itself. It's fragrance-free which really is essential. I don't understand why other companies continue to put fragrance in skin-care products.This face cream is more of a rich lotion and it's hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic and fragrance-free. It has what you need and doesn't have what you don't need. I hate to have to rave, but I think it's perfect (for me at least). It plumps my skin and has properties that attract moisture and hold it in. Over time it works even better and restores the delicate mantle of the skin.Apparently, this is often recommended by dermatologists and now I know why. It's a bland, yet highly effective face cream that really does what it says."
76844,0,"Love the color! But face it, who wants to wear something on their lips that tastes & smells pretty bad? I have to put a strawberry clear gloss over it just to cover that up. But like I said, it is a very nice color though.. and looks different from the bottle color when it's on."
83339,0,I was looking for something that soaks into your hands. This seems to me to be more of a coating that stays on your hands untill you get them wet. Then you end up wipping it on the tpwels. Will probaly not purchase again.
105282,0,"It seemed just like a normal conditioner There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it."
140030,0,"This cream is nice but nothing special. Given the whopping price tag, you're better off just using shea butter. I didn't get any stretch marks and used one container of this lotion, the oil this company makes, and later, plain old shea butter.

133513,0,"Topical medical product such as this generally falls into two category--either works or not. It all depends on your genetic makeup. You can read all the reviews and do all the research, but the bottom line is that you won't know for sure until you try it. Most men who lost, or is losing, their hair and is concern about it are most likely willing to try anything, and this has a good value when compared to the name-brand counterpart; the rating I gave is purely for the price and not the result. Unfortunately this product didn't work for me, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you either."
151912,0,"I have bought punky colors for years, but I have never bought this color before. It want what I expected it to be. It is really light and washes out way faster than any of the other colors I have bought before. It would be a really pretty color if it actually took on my hair!"

132850,0,"I purchased Dr. Bronner's eucalyptus liquid soap from Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon. I read a review that warned it was watery but I took my chances. Yes, indeed, it is very watery. I use much more of it than I want in order to wash with it simply because it is too watery. Sometimes I wonder if it is eucalyptus-scented water. I like it, I like how it leaves my skin feeling, but I am very disappointed at the cost-to-water ratio. If I could find a better alternative I would, but so far have had little luck finding eucalyptus soap anywhere else."
215209,2,"If volume is all that you are concerned about, this shampoo does the trick. Your hair color will also hold quite nicely. You get a noticeable increase in volume and, while the price of the shampoo is high, a small dose of shampoo (about the size of a nickel) will lather your hair. Now, what about the drawbacks?If I don't condition my hair after usage, this shampoo leaves my hair completely tangled. There is no way I can get a comb through it. After conditioning, my hair is manageable (although I find I need to use a significant amount of the conditioner to get there). And, conditioner or no conditioner, the texture of my hair is awful. I wish you could feel the difference for yourself. This shampoo removed all shine and softness from my hair. My hair is dull and unpleasant to the touch (although some loss of the smoothness of your hair will occur with any volume shampoo). Furthermore, I find the smell potent and displeasing. It is extremely flowery with chemical notes.To conclude, I bought the shampoo and conditioner almost two months ago and I can't wait to finish it up so I can try a new shampoo. I thought it was too expensive to throw away. I, personally, think this shampoo is not worth the cost."
82957,2,"I bought a Chi for my daughter for Christmas. I just stopped working after 3 months. When I called Chi they said there was nothing they could to because there was only a 90-day warrantee. I bought a True Ceramic Pro about 7 years ago and have not a single problem with it. I wish I had bought the TCP for my daughter. If I knew someone who was going to buy the Chi, I would try to talk her out of it."
70850,0,"Loved the color. Was so excited to use this product. It turned out great, it just didn't last as long as I had hoped. After a week, it was already beginning to get dull and fade."
36829,1,Would recommend this product for education. Use it to teach new employees about correct handwashing techniques. You want to make sure that the individual lets the product drys before washing their hands.
195143,1,I've worn this great scent and have had numerous compliments from it! And I'm complimenting Amazon with their prices that are hard to beat. The supplier that shipped this product was fast and I had no hassles.
54022,2,"I was looking for a large roller set for body and volume and thought this would be good after reading many of the reviews. After using it a couple times, it did not work for me and I returned itPros: Large roller sizes: The super jumber rollers (1.75"") were too big for me but great from someone who has longer hair.I did like the 1.5"" rollers.Heats up quicklyPerfect number of rollers not too big not too small great for small storage spacesCons:Pins to hold in place: One of the worst things about it. No matter what way I put the pins in or how many I used I couldn't get it to stay! The rollers are big which makes them heavy and the pins provide a horrible hold at best.Burned my fingers on both the rollers AND when I was picking up a roller on the slats they sit on. This has NEVER happened to me with the traditional rollers that sit on pegs. How are you supposed to use them if the rollers themselves get so hot?I sent it back and am searching for something similar with more pros."

175550,0,"So, this stuff really does smell very good!However, when I opened my package, I did not recieve a bottle that said ""Versace"" I recieved a bottle that said ""VERSUS"" Does amazon purchase things from Chinatown???????? My purchase came straight from amazon, not from another retailer, so I would suggest buying this from somewhere else!!Again, it smells good, but it's fake!"
201907,1,This is the perfect red shade of nail polish ...not too red and not too pink. Just that right mix!
19054,1,This is the best make up for skin. I haven't had a break out or oily skin since I started to use this brand. I would never smear all those chemicals from the liquid make ups on my face again.
40065,1,This works great. Very sharp cut. You need to watch out because your nails will be sharp for the next few days if you don't file them down. Should last forever. Works well on toes too.
9871,1,I've used this product for years and it's getting harder to find in stores so I'm thrilled to get it online at a good price.
181730,2,"I was so excited about this color of polish. I was looking for a bright, fun summer color and this is a beautiful shade. However, to even get the color close to what it looks like on the bottle, you need at least 3 coats. And even with a good topcoat, it only lasted less than 2 days before it was peeling off so badly I had to remove it. It's a shame because I love china glaze polish and I was really hoping for this color to be my summer go-to, but I think I'll keep looking. Oh and this color is matte when applied so make sure if you decide to give it a try that you have a shiny topcoat handy, without it, it's not flattering."
149358,1,"Since I bought this product I discover that my eyeshadow holds for longer time and really pop up the colors, specially metallic ones."
83814,0,"First off, the bottle is awesome, the juice isn't too bad. To me it smells like clean laundry, that may be good or bad. Although the smell is inoffensive, don't wear this expecting compliments and people asking what that fragrance is, because it won't happen. It's best role is probably as a nice, fresh, inoffensive scent for spring and summer wear around the office."
132269,1,"After 1 jar, my feet were soft and smooth again. The army had left them scaly an ugly.Thanks Cutemol!"
137082,0,"This nail polish looked different in the picture online that I saw. I thought it would be a nice, shimmery nude color, however, you may as well not even paint your nails. It is basically like putting on a topcoat and that's it. I couldn't even tell my nails were painted. I would definitely only use this as a topcoat. It wasn't even that shiny though. I love OPI, but I would pass on this one and go for something else."
227887,0,"This product is very similar to a cold creme in that it is very oily (a lot of petrolium and mineral oil). I have used Cetaphil and more recently Purpose for dry skin. I normally love Dove products; however, I would definitly reccomend the Purpose over the Dove. The Dove did not rinse completely off and left a thin film on my skin. That said, it is very gentle."
70027,0,I got this because I bought the regular scent from the mall. I love the way it makes my hands and body feels but I dont like the scent. I was expecting something a little more softer or sexier.
147509,2,"After few minutes on , shut off , and it seen not to blow enough hot air to dry the hair. And, the attachments are not good quality."
74436,1,Got this for my wife to accompany a robe and she loves it - she uses it all the time. My mother in law got her a different brand and she prefers this one.
211935,1,"This is a great product, well worth the price. Works very well on my skin, also great for burns. I would definitely buy this again."
182212,2,"This color is VERY sheer, after about 5 coats you will finally get an opaque color and then it peels off in about a day. Definitely avoid this nail polish."
133554,1,"I ordered my first box on here but then had to dump it in international customs and ended up buying it again at COSTCO for around the same price. Im 23 but have the body of a 40 year old, very strange indeed :) I had to start shaving in 3rd grade, was 6 feet tall in sixth grade, and have pretty much stopped growing all around. Unfortunately, my hair took a hit too when I was 21. I had nice long hair but cut it all off when I went to an Army training course and it just never really grew back on top. It was super thin on top and didnt grow in the front besides two little patches. Also I had a pretty bad bald spot. Seeing pictures of my hair made me rather sad. Finally I got this and am very suprised. I usually bic my head so I continued to do so while applying this 2x a day. After about 2 months I noticed hair growing where it was not before. The top of my head is coming in slow and surely. Rather suprised to see it growing some good hairs on my hair line which is going to be nice. Remember it takes awhile for the medicine to work, thats why I continued to shave my head. This is definately better than Nioxin and especially effective if you started hair loss within the past few years. The price is right also, and be sure to get the 5% and not the 2%."
150757,0,"I have super thin/fine hair and my stylist recommended this shampoo, which she used when her (usually thick) hair was falling out due to stress (wedding planning). She said it had worked for her - her hair was thick again - but then her stressful situation had also passed.I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and my boyfriend thinks my hair looks thicker. I got some for him, and I think his hair looks thicker too. Neither of us actually has thicker hair now (existing hair doesn't get thicker from a shampoo - ask your Dr. - new hair might grow in thicker, but that takes months to see), but we look better. And it seems to have cleared up my dandruff.What my stylist thought and what seems to be the case, is that this shampoo/conditioner combo removes product buildup. And maybe that will help new hair growth, but after 3 months of use, I don't see any evidence of that.It also makes my scalp burn. Or maybe that's the conditioner, or the combination of the shampoo and conditioner, but I have somewhat sensitive skin and it turns my scalp (and my neck/face if it touches them) red. The first time I used it, I was seriously worried I was going to LOSE my hair to a chemical burn. It doesn't hurt as much now, but it still burns - and I'm still using it. What can I say - it makes my hair look thicker. Oh vanity."
181968,1,It a very intense and proper care for my hair. All my friends recommended it to acquire for myself. I dont regret it at all.
145434,1,"This product worked great on my new, bright stretch marks. I used it in the morning and at night, and after 4 weeks, the marks are almost completely gone!"
39572,0,"This curling iron is nice. It makes big loose curls and that's what I ordered it for. The red light ""on"" indicator does not work. That was really the only problem, otherwise it's worth the money"
43679,1,"This is a great shampoo for people with sensitive scalps. My scalp reacts to almost every shampoo I use (Aveda, Bumble and Bumble, neutrogena, paul mitchell, L'oreal professional, etc) and often flakes or gets itchy. With this shampoo I never have this problem. I also have thick curly very dry hair and this shampoo is very nourishing. It is expensive but given my hair and scalp issues, it is worth the money."
29706,1,It bleached my hair very quickly. I ended up keeping the bleach in for overnight becauase the first time i did it for two hours and i have dirty blonde hair and it barely bleached it. It was also expensive and I wasn't happy that I even had to buy it in the first place because the hair dye should've worked without having me to bleach it in the first place.
130595,2,"I thought this product would be a nice burgandy color for winter, but it was WAY too dark. I have longer nails and it looked almost goth on me. It might look better on someone with shorter nails. A few of my friends saw it and commented on how dark, almost black it looked after 2 coats. So far I haven't been able to give this bottle of polish away!"
129736,1,This shampoo is gentle enough for daily use and does not leave my hair weighed down...this happens easily due to oily hair...ugh. great stuff..BUY IT
73379,2,"I don't know if B&B changed the formulation, but the bottle I got has a much more watery consistency than the one I purchased from the salon. It also does not smell the same."
68619,2,"Liked the idea of ""total body experience"" and decided to treat myself to a nice set. The reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because of its nice packaging. It comes with a handle and a few attachments for different parts of your body. I didn't try all of them, only the one for the body (the biggest one), and you really have to hold it at a certain angle, otherwise, this thing just slips off the handle. another thing, the handle is too short for the ""hard-to-reach places."" And I hate the body creme! It is so hard to rid off and it doesn't really make me feel ""clean"" after the shower... it leaves or at least it feels like it does some kind of a thin layer on my skin (I do clean it well)... I've been using Micro Pearl Abrasion Resurfacing Treatment with Micronized Pearl for my face and love this product! So, excellent results from using this product gave me an idea to go for the ""total body experience."" What a disappointment, especially for $130! There are so many sets out there and the most expensive one certainly doesn't mean the best. Try neutrogena set for around $40 or the one mentioned above (available @ drugstore.com) before you decide to waste $130!"
5194,2,"I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn't help that I have an oily T-zone. When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it's for oily skin, but I was wrong....so wrong. After about an hour, the makeup ""slides"" off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots. So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it's all clumped. There is no ""smoothing"" it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it's still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I've tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn't cover the redness on my skin. Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly. I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again."
223797,1,"You are never fully dressed until you have on some perfume. Indeed, even when wearing nothing at all (or perhaps, especially when you are wearing nothing at all) you need some perfume - sweet, alluring and sexy. For me, my most favorite scent of all is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds. White Diamonds is sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery. It has an excellent scent that lasts on my skin and smells excellent.For me and the man of my life, it's got to be White Diamonds. We highly recommend this wonderful perfume to you, or perhaps for that special lady in you life!(Review of White Diamonds Eau de Toilette Spray Naturel, 3.3 oz.)"

241916,0,"The product is great, a five star product no doubt, one I've used before and really like. The price seemed right--wonderful, in fact--but the shipping charge from this particular vendor more than tripled the price of the shampoo. I'll buy the shampoo again--from another vendor."
78659,0,I bought this for my son because I heard rave reviews. He was greatly disappointed. It appeared watered down (not potent) and didn't work at all. I've found recipes online for homemade Tend Skin that's made with alcohol and aspirin and it seems to work much better. I found this product way too expensive and not worth it.

147007,2,"Okay, I own one of these, and it is like the worst flat iron ever. It caught my hair at the ends and frayed it so my hair had a ton of splits. I could see all of the broken ends and damage it did to my hair, and it did.t straighten it too well either. If you want to have frayed, damaged, thin hair, buy this product. You are better off with another flat iron."
10904,0,"I kept mine in the shower, and it grew mold. Be sure to let it air dry to prevent this. Maybe it could be made to resist mold as well."
72451,2,"I recently was on a cruise ship where they used this product on me. The product they used was in a tube and seemed to work immediately!! When I tried to purchase on the ship, they were out, but gave me all the information I would need to find it online and purchase it. From what I can tell the ship must have a stronger product that actually works! This is very watery and DOES NOT give the same results as the trial on ship. I used the one on the ship 3 times and all results were the same. I have used the one I have for 2 weeks and NOTHING about it is close to being the same."
107248,0,"I am not sure how to rate this product. I originally purchased Kenzo Flower in a 3.4 ounce / 100 ml bottle through Amazon andreceived a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle. The shipping was fast and secured, the fragrance is nice, however I was not aware thatthis was made in a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle, not sure if the original. I am still waiting for what I ordered and paid for, KenzoFlower in a 3.4 ounce bottle."
130326,1,With two coats of this fun shimmer you get a nice pearl effect. The nail is still transparent after the two coats but I quite like it. I tried it over a few other favorite polishes and love the shimmer it added to those colors as well. Endless possibilities! Polish goes on nicely and evenly. Love this OPI!
228080,1,I have used Boscia products for about 2 years and continue to be pleased. Product arrived quickly and as described.
191460,0,"This hairdryer is overpriced for the value. I dropped it and pieces went flying. I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place. Not worth the money, wish I would have got a less expensive hair dryer. All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag. Not impressed. Would not recommend this product to a friend."
113594,0,"I did read previous reviews but I still thought it was such a pretty color. It is very glittery, with very little of the actual purple color. It is great as an over coat or for maybe younger girls."
98457,2,"I am a fan of many different types of fragrances. Right now I've been using YSL's L'homme quite a bit. Trying D'Hermes after wearing that felt like a major downgrade and disappointment.To me this was an obnoxious scent; burnt wood and shaved citrus rinds sums it up nicely. Not only that but it is a very overpowering burnt wood and citrus. With only two sprays and even after hours it was still up my nose, and I know everyone within a 20' radius in the grocery store could smell it as well. If you're into that then I highly recommend this EDT. It has good staying power and good sillage; unfortunately in the case of a scent this bad that is not something to brag about.I should mention I bought the EDT and not the parfum."
130274,0,"The smell is excellent. It smells very vanilla-y. I read that a lot of people get complements on this fragrance, but I don't see how this is possible. After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone. It has no staying power at all."
206421,1,Amazing concealer. Much better than the really expensive brands I have used in the past. I bought this one for only a 1 in Poundland last year and it has lasted me until now. Running out now and I cant find it anywhere. Such shame because it is the best to conceal age spots! Five stars.
137114,0,"I bought this because I thought it would be good nail coverage that was neutral in color and also professional. Professional maybe, but neutral it is not. Tickle My France-y might be the best neutral nude from OPI. My undertone is warm, and this color looks so blah on my hands. It looks darker on the nail than it does in the picture."
36648,0,Worked ok but my freakishly oily skin adapted to it quickly and the shine control didn't last as long as I'd hope. Check out Skindinavia No Shine for about the same price with better shine control.
216421,1,"I started using Ineral 30 years ago and there is nothing on the market today that matches it for the price. I might go as far as saying there is nothing that matches it anywhere that I have found. This truly is a Hair Fixer, fusing broken and weakened hair back together. This product is especially good right after any chemical treatment, like coloring, perming, or straightening since it seals the hair cuticle and helps prevent breakage and frizzing from damaged ends. Other reviewers have mentioned to use a clarifying shampoo for better results, and this is true. Conditioning shampoos can block the penetration of the bonding agent. Also, the directions no longer mention not to use conditioner after shampooing, but you shouldn't. The original instructions also told you to not excessively towel dry the hair.I can no longer find this product locally and I am thrilled I can still buy it through Amazon. I just wish the shipping and handling wasn't such a gouge, or the seller offered quantity discounts. Still, I buy 6 at a time and they last me a over year as a weekly treatment. If you have breakage or weak, no body hair, try this. It works."
106079,0,"As I said, by looking at the weight I was hoping it to be slightly bigger than this. .."
132747,0,"The product received was very good quality, and I was pleased. That said, the picture shows two (2) hand mitts and one (1) boot mitt was received. Shipping took full 10 days to receive (Amazon normal is three)."
29313,0,So disappointed with this perfume oil. You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it. This oil is so diluted and weak. It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio. Until then I would not purchase again sadly.
182862,1,"Simply put, these are the best toe nail clippers I've ever bought. Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn't nearly as good. This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it's completely worth it."
241900,1,"You can go either way with this styling gel. Curls or straight. It holds well. It keeps your hair together and weighs it down a bit, I like the glow it gives to my hair, not glittery but a very deep shine. It would definitely bring out the color in your hair. Giovanni makes great products and this is one of them. Keep it up :)"
137618,0,"It is def neon as stated. But the picture shows the color to be pink. It is actually a peachy orange color. Its still real pretty, although I am a pink girl."
26501,0,"First off I would like to say that I have been using this product since December 2012. Six months later I have noticed no significant change to my skin, I do not look 5 years younger, but my skin has not gotten any older either. After saying that, I do like this product. I am prone to acne, especially when I first change moisturizers, but have had no problems with this one, which is why I will continue to use it for the time being.However, the purpose for this review is to notify people about the actual ingredients of this product (in case someone has an allergy or sensitive skin), which have not been listed accurately on Amazon, something I have been finding with disturbing regularity on a number of Amazon products.Ingredients listed on the actual Neuvaderm container that are not listed on Amazon include: zingiber officinale (ginger root) extract, grapefruit seed extract, and citrus aurantium (bitter orange peel) extract.Ingredients listed on Amazon that are not on the Neuvaderm container include: methyl paraben and propyl paraben.And the ingredients listed on Amazon are not in the same order as on the container, so the ingredient concentrations are not accurate."
5598,0,"I bought this mirror for barbering. It's very sensitive and prone to sctaching.I wouldn't say that this mirror is a bad mirror, I just would say it's not meant to use to often, and you should keep it away from things that may scratch it."
132224,1,"I like this moisturizer, and it doesn't make my skin breakout. However, it has an orange tint that you can see on your skin. It looks fine on your skin though, maybe like a slight bronzer. However, it can also stain clothing, so be careful with it. It also has a unique smell--perhaps the carrots? It's not a bad smell, but I would characterize it as on the earthy side rather than on the perfumy side."
33648,0,"I read the reviews and thought I was buying a shampoo that would really do something for my hair, but I see no benefits. My problem is just dry hair and I've been using it(shampoo and conditioner) for 3 weeks and I see no changes..."
585,0,The brush head is slightly smalled and the brush itself is not as thick as previously purchased equal brush from same sales.
81833,0,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews I decided to try this while at Ulta. What really struck me was the plasticky smell that hung around for a good two hours. I think I am also allergic because I got a pretty bad headache. My 10 year old son, my husband and mother-in-law and I all thought it smelled pretty awful. Maybe we just have different tastes. After a bit of time, what was left was a soft cotton candy type smell. Okay smelling when it finally died down, but for obvious reasons, I won't be purchasing pink sugar."
169480,2,"I am accustomed to REN Tamanu High Glide Shaving Oil. I preface this review as such because the REN oil is a stark contrast to this Anthony product. Your preferences and prior experiences will likely dictate whether this is the product you are after. I found that the Anthony oil applies thick and leaves your skin feeling 'sticky' in a way I was not prepared for from a pre-shave oil. I use it sparingly after wetting my hand with warm water and rubbing the oil for a few seconds before massaging it into my beard. I don't often shave, so, when I do, my whiskers are lengthy--and most often pre-buzzed by a beard trimmer prior to the shave itself. This product does seem to soften my beard up a bit and prepare it for the shave, but I much prefer the experience with REN. This is my first bottle (now about halfway done) and I don't think I'll be getting a second."
54169,0,"If you use curlers on top of your head (from the forehead back to the top-middle) they flop forward. The clips do not seem to be heavy enough or able to be positioned so that the curlers to not fall forward. Very maddening. If you don't need to use curlers on the top of your head (or for bangs) the hairsetter is fine - otherwise, don't buy it."
220614,2,"I read the instructions carefully before applying, and I still looked like a geisha- I couldn't get the white to blend in. Not to mention they charge $7 + $5 shipping and handling for a product that is the size of two thimbles."
212172,0,"the perfume works fine but...the price keeps dropping after I bought it.it should not be a problem but since I am in Accounting, it means something."
104504,0,"I smelled a tester of this on my last cruise and fell in love with it. I ordered it from Amazon and when I got the bottle open and sprayed it on, it smelled the same, but seemed to be a watered-down version of the one I tested. I paid $56+ for this perfume and may send it back. Too bad, it smelled great on the boat!!!"
8900,1,"I ordered this product to give it a try. So far it seems to work okay.It's kind of hard to put it on the bck of my head,but I will keep using it.I do have to say that my daughter ordered and she loves it."
112956,2,"The blowdrying function works fine, but it's quite big and heavy and the handle and the switches are poorly positioned that makes it even more awkward to use. I've had blowdryers of similar size and weight, or even bigger, but I never felt so awkward using one as I did with this one.The handle and switches are positioned where your hand is holding the device far from where the dryer head is at the top, the physics of it makes it weigh even more on your arm. The heat and on/off switches are located at a spot where it is very difficult to push/slide with my thumb while holding up the blowdryer normally. To adjust the setting or to turn it on or off, I would have to lower it in front of me and carefully balance it with one hand to turn the switches toward me, often while intense hot air is blowing in my face, so that my thumb can be at a good enough angle to be able to push the switches without twisting a muscle in my hand. Sometimes my arm would have already gotten too tired from using the blowdryer so when it comes time to adjust the heat or turn it off, I'd lean it on the bathroom counter to push the switch instead of doing the whole one hand balancing maneuver.I'm used to just being able to switch settings on my blowdryer easily and continue to dry my hair without having to lower the blowdryer in front of my chest while it's going. The motion is similar to someone trying to find the mute button on their TV remote when they hear their phone ringing. There is the same panic and irritation from wanting to stop the loudness and the hot air that's blowing everywhere except at my hair, and having difficulty reaching or finding that off button! To sum up, it's just a pain to use."
172931,1,The ABBA ZeroScent Finishing is a great find for someone with allergies and problems with scented products. The spray is fine and the hold is great. This is a wonderful product!
148523,2,"I used these like 3 times.. they don't get very hot, they didn't curly my hair well (hair is a little past shoulders).. I stuck them under the sink and completely forgot that I was once excited about them. I'd go a different route in the future."
139222,0,"I really love Nature's Gate Herbal Hair Shampoo (as pictured above) but this seller (PrettyLikeMe) sent me the NG Herbal Daily Cleansing Shampoo instead. Very similar item, but NOT the same. Slightly different ingredients list.

The Daily Cleansing Shampoo is $20.43 (this is $30.99) and even after shipping it is still $4 cheaper than this for the exact same thing that they ship to you.As far as the product quality, I have used NG Herbal Hair Shampoo for over 10 years and cannot find anything else even remotely as nice ...

263,1,"It's the most long lasting concealer I've found but please, with any heavy use of concealer it is critical to use a primer underneath the concealer. ANY concealer will sink into your lines and cake if you don't. Nevertheless this is natural, easily layerable and looks good in sunlight, which is always the harshest light out there."
194065,0,"I love OPI and have been using it for years. I was on the hunt for the perfect mint green shade for summer and came across this one. I've never used China Glaze before, but see it in salons so thought it has to be decent. It is a very cool color and I love it, but it doesn't last long at all and I will never buy another China Glaze polish. It chips after only a day...very disappointing. Doesn't hold up near as long as OPI."

26812,2,"I bought this product of Amazon and I'm really disapointed that I did. While the product does appear to be authentic and smells like the authentic product it is not nearly as potent nor as long lasting as a store bought bottle. My last bottle, bought from a department store, took only 3 sprays and the scent lasted all day. The bottle I bought off e-bay takes 6 or 7 sprays and the scent is almost gone by the time I get to work. Extremely disapointing!"

106836,1,"I did not purchase this product from the seller, but I have been wearing Issey Miyake for almost 7 years now and every time I wear it someone ends up asking me what I am wearing. I have had to write the fragrance name down for a man who wanted to buy it for his wife.It's a gorgeous perfume - light enough for every day, but easily transitions into a flirty night fragrance. I haven't had a problem with staying power. I'll put it on in the morning and it lasts at least 10 hours (I only apply to my wrists and behind my ears - I know some people do a spritz and walk through the mist, but that doesn't allow the perfume to soak into your skin at the warmest points. Also, when you apply the perfume to your wrists, don't rub it in - it damages the scent. Just shake your hands around if you need it to dry quickly)It is somewhat pricey compared to many other department store fragrances, but not terrible. I have to warn you, it is a ""gateway"" perfume. Once you wear it, you won't be able to go back to cheaper perfumes. :)"

69036,0,"Hello,I am still unsure on what to write about this hair product. When I first put it in my hair-- after washing it-- this product made it extremely hard for me to comb through my hair. My hair literally felt like straw! But after I finally brushed out the many tangles, blow-dryed it and styled it-- my hair did appear softer and even felt softer than before. I even got a few compliments from strangers telling me that my hair looked shiny! But I still don't like to use it everyday because it honestly seems to make my hair a lot dryer and harder to brush out when it is in the wet stage! Maybe I just need a better conditioner (Though, my conditioner is a Matrix product) I don't know... I am still testing it... Thumbs down at first then up and then mid way!?I guess I was looking for a miricle-- lol -Ronda"
22293,1,"I'm allergic to most fragrances, and this had no fragrance to bother my allergies. It has a slight soapy scent in the bottle, but nothing that stayed with my hair. It worked well, though I use a bit more than previous products. Overall: Effective, fragrance free shampoo."

83585,2,"I ordered this for my 86 year old mother thinking it was the 4 setting control white model with gold and black stickers/lettering that was on the picture. Instead they substituted the newer 1061 Hot Tools 2 setting model with Pink lettering that everyplace else on the internet has for much cheaper than Lil Gift LLC. My mother set it up and turned it on, well, the hot is way too hot and the low is too low, and there is no in between. It is also very cheap construction and difficult for an older person's arthritic hands to adjust.DO NOT ORDER this product from Lil Gift, LLC. They are substituting a cheaper version than what is in the picture. I purchase a lot of stuff on Amazon.com, but this seller has just lost a potential customer. I will be paying a bit more to find a good dryer for my mom, but The Hot Tools pink model 1061 is poor quality."

93162,2,"I was so excited to see this on Amazon. I went ahead and ordered it (good thing I didn't order two like I wanted to) Anyhow first the box is wrong. Original box for Noa came in TWO pieces. ( As recently as 6 months ago, as I bought a few in Toronto) This box came in one piece. Second as soon as you spray it on you it smells like alcohol. And for any of you who don't know FAKE perfum typically smells like that. It smells NOTHING like the other THREE bottles I have ( I like to stock up as this perfum is so hard to find). I would def return if I could, but because it's open I can't. Please don't buy it is DEF FAKE! =-/"
195331,2,"Honestly.. giving one star feels too much for this product: The acetone smell, was beyond overpowering! Can not tell you anything about the color or the streaks - because if was nearly impossible to get any tan... after applying it for a good week, every night in a row! So after putting up with uncomfortable stickiness, the awful smell - it was very disappointing to see no change in color! Very disappointed about everything in this product - would never ever buy it again.BTW, I've tried them all - top shelf (Dior, Channel, Clinique, etc.,) and have not had any luck until accidentally stumbled across Bare Escentuals Faux Tan. Smell, instant color, overall very happy to finally have that real-looking gorgeous tan! Read up on it! (Highly recommend getting a tan application body buffing brush as well, since it gives an instant tan to the palms of your hands, that is nearly impossible to get rid off...)Good luck!"
241447,0,"I received my chi nano, but not until about 4 wks after ordering it. I chose this seller because all of the other feedback said how fast their items had arrived. Not really sure why my order took so long, I did email the seller and never received a response."
89138,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did."
154923,1,"I have owned countless curling irons over the years and was never truly satisfied with the results until the salon I used brought in the larger barrel Rusk irons. You can create perfect ""natural waves"" and larger, more realistic soft curls. The length of the rod created longer curls/waves versus my more expensive Baby Bliss. About.com rates it the curling iron that will last a lifetime [...] The ceramic rod is gentler and causes less hair breakage. It heats up very quickly. It is a good buy, especially under $100."
195419,1,Product is great. Drys my hair really fast. Company shippped it quickly and it was packed well. I was very happy.

182367,2,"The Iconic Frostbite is all over the nail blogs as the ""it"" color.. frosty high luster medium blue with fire within.Well.. I don't know why but this bottle I got from here was dark.. more like a slightly shimmery navy. Not pretty on my olive skin. I was expecting the color in the blogs.. a vibrant beautiful light Royal blue.. instead.. it is quite dark.. with a slight shimmer if you put your hand in the sun... just looks like Navy cream polish...I don't know if the formula is different.. I don't know if this is a second? I don't know if the blogs lie... but you know mailing it back would just cost more than the whole thing is worth.I guess.. if you are looking for the Iconic Blue in the Blogs.. try buying in person and try on...Just looked too dark.. and was totally not what I expected.. very sad..."
243543,0,I used this once and i didn't feel it did anything. I stopped using it. I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.
212297,1,"Love this hair color. It was a perfect match. I was expecting a little more red in the final process, but it came out just the right shade of a dark red gold blonde. Very soft, not damaging like most products and it lasts longer and stays shiny looking longer than store bought colors. If you go to the developlus website, it has a wonderful section about colors and color wheels and tells you step by step how to correct any problems. I followed their formula and it came out perfect. I use the OOps color remover, loved it, so soft, and the satin silicone developer for gray hair. Loved all of them. Won't go back to store brand anymore. The prices are actually cheaper in the long run because I can get 2-3 colors out of each bottle."
164229,0,"Satisfied with this purchase, but need to comment on the temperature. Once the iron heats up on the high setting, it gets VERY hot. Need to be careful not to leave it on anything that might melt or be flamable. Also, be careful as to how long you leave it in place on your hair (might burn hair and scalp)."
93031,2,"This product did nothing to my hair. It didn't lighten it at all, just made it kinda shinier...slightly. it also damaged it. My hair, which was smooth and silky before, turned crunchy. Also, the fumes are so strong and I got a little bit of formula on my skin, well it BURNED!"
238395,2,I got this for my mom to color her hair. Her head and arms swelled up massively after using just a little of it. I thought this would be gentle natural alternative to ammonia/peroxide based hair color products. Beware taking this!!!
181584,0,"First of all this polish (as do all blue polishes) has a really odd smell..I don't know what it is that makes it smell so strange. Secondly, this is a great color! It's a dark royal blue with a lighter blue micro-glitter and some purplish undertones. Unfortunately it really does not work with my skintone so I've only worn it once. Wear time is also not that great, I was getting chips by the second day and it was peeling by the third, but that might have been because of the base coat i was using at that time. I really do like the color though."
71770,0,"After reading reviews, I was very anxious to try this concealer. When I first put it on, I was so pleased! It really seemed to cover well. But, within a few hours, I could see a lot of dry lines under my eyes that had never been noticeable before. Bummer."
159175,2,"I used this fragrance and approximately 2 hours later it had worn off!I have bought the same Prada elsewhere before, so I knew that this Prada I bought from Stores123 was watered down.This perfume was refillable and came with an atomiser. I could see how Stores123 watered the perfume down, due to a removable cap to replace with the atomiser, perfume can be poured out or something poured into the bottle.To charge almost $85.00 for this perfume and for it to be watered down is disgusting!I suppose Stores123 employees thinks consumers are dumb and just may not know, what they fail to realize some consumers like myself have had the top quality of this product before.I asked for a refund, but before I did, I intentionally doused myself with this perfume again to have made sure I just may have used too little the first time, and it was still the same result. I was offered $50.00 back. I insisted I wanted a complete refund. The man from Stores123 told me they were offering me $50.00 because I was going to get to keep the perfume!I told him he could have the perfume back(it's a policy for stores to not accept liquids back for safety and health reasons). I was told by him that he would have to talk with his colleagues about the full refund.Now when he tried to bargain with me, I knew immediately watering down this perfume is exactly what they had done! I wouldn't pay $35.00 for this watered down perfume!I would have to say, anytime a refillable bottle of perfume is purchased, you'd better get it from a high end reputable store and or know and trust who is selling it, because there is the accessibility to remove or add a product like water to dilute the product.I did get my entire refund(I have to say the employee was nice and professional the entire time I requested my refund, still being nice and professional does not change the fact Stores 123 staff are underhanded and sneaky).I will not buy from Stores123 again and unless Amazon removes them as a vendor, no one else should buy from Stores123 because they try to swindle customers by intentionally selling inferior products."
231053,2,"After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good. Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately. The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it. Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned. Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement. How it got a UL rating I'll never know. I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item."
125469,0,"My overall feeling about this moisturizer is positive... or, well, it would be if it didn't somehow manage to always migrate into my eyes and sting like crazy, no matter how careful I am to avoid my eye area (disappointing, because that is the only area on my face where I have lines). Maybe I am just a bona fide freak, but I swear I have never had this problem with any other moisturizer. It's crazy. I normally use Oil of Olay for Sensitive Skin, which also stings a bit if it gets in my eyes because of the sunscreen, but it doesn't... creep, or migrate... the way this lotion does. I seriously don't understand it.Other than that, it has a nice consistency and a fairly innocuous smell, and it does leave my skin very soft. I just cant use it because of the horrible, horrible burning."

However, with this product, I did't see it to last as how my other one did...and the other one (that obviously ran out, so I came here to buy one for cheaper..which I never will do again) lasted all day..and it was great..this one only lasts for like 30 minutes and then you don't smell it anymore unless you smell it closely..but not when you walk by.... this product was a fake..i think the seller mixed it with water or something..I am extremely disappointed that I spent this kind of money on it and it is a fake."
200506,2,"It's exfoliating, all right. On the plus, it does leave my skin smooth, but it kind of hurts getting there. The size and shape make it awkward to hold, and because the outer covering is so thick, it's hard to get it rinsed really clean. Wouldn't purchase again."

THE PRODUCT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST..I WAS USING IT AFTER MY MORNING SHOWER LIKE I ALWAYS DO AND I DROPPED IT AND THE BLUB (toning tip)GLASS BROKE ... I WAS SO UPSET CALLED HSN AND QVC AND THEY DIDNT HAVE IT.. SO I KEPT THE DERMWAND BOOKLET THAT CAME WITH IT AND LOOKED FOR THIER SITE. THEN THOUGHT OF AMAZON AND LOW AND BEHOLD I FOUND IT!!!! I WAS SO HAPPY... I'M GOING TO ODER ME ANOTHER I HOPE I CAN GET IT RIGHT AWAY..I ALSO USE THIS DERMAWAND ON MT UPPER ARMS AND IT IS DOING WONDERS ON MY SAGGY ARMS...
58816,0,This stuff worked the first couple times I used it but I made the mistake of leaving it on 7 minutes (it says up to 8) and it burnt my face really badly. It is excellent for spot treatment but it is extremely harsh for my sensitive combination skin and I would definitely recommend starting off with a less abrasive peel.
84868,1,"After the store I had been buying them at quit carrying them, I searched in every store I frequented and some I did not, for another good pair of moisturizing gloves. Then I searched all over the internet, and I was beginning to think I'd have to sew my own. Then I found Sephoras's gloves. They're perfect...a good fit, with just the right amount of stretch, and since I've had them for a while, I can tell you that they stand up to multiple washings very well. They're even better than the gloves I used to buy, and I was pleased with those, so that's saying a lot. Worth every penny."

So far the cream is doing great, we still use aquaphor in the evenings. I like the lightness, the quick absorption and it is not greasy. The pump on the jar is a plus."

71167,0,"I ordered this perfume only because my fifteen old daughter said it was popular with teens and also had a good scent, but I did not care for it I thought it was too strong!"
58579,1,"On a whim I decided to try this hair colorant. It was very easy to apply, it did not sting or burn my scalp, it was pleasant smelling. I should say that I had let my hair grow out to it's natural color for over a year (mousy brown gray) because I was tired of spending both the time and the $120 at Aveda salons.I am glad I chose a lighter color, mine was in fact golden honey blonde, the permanent colorant. My hair turned out much darker than I expected after leaving the colorant on for the full 20 minutes. It certainly does cover the gray! And the gray hair does appear a bit lighter than the rest of my hair - which is fine. The color is very rich and deep. A bit too much for what I was expecting, however I will say that I can't see any difference between this product and the very expensive treatments I used to have at Aveda salons. I would use it again, and perhaps mix it with an even lighter shade of blonde. Or - leave it on for less time. I wouldn't hesitate to try it again, although I will also say that I look forward to it's lightening up a bit after shampooing. It's supposed to fade out between 3- 5 weeks. I would also like to add that every once and awhile I was surprised at how my ""regular"" color turned out at the salon - perhaps that's due to the nature of my hair. If you are interested in trying this product, perhaps choose a shade or 2 lighter at first or don't leave it on as long if you don't want such an vibrant color. Also, the other reviewer's tip on using the conditioner was well advised, I think it did make my hair softer after the process. Some reviewers thought they needed 2 bottles, my hair is also thick and shoulder length and one bottle was more than enough for me."
218443,0,"This conditioner is great and does everything it claims and everything the reviewers have raved about. However, I bought it 2 weeks ago and have already used it all. The directions tell you to use an excessive amount each time. I have long hair and the directions say to use 30-40 pumps for long or thick hair. I cannot justify spending this much on conditioner for such limited use. You can use it as a leave in conditioner, however, so I may do that in the future."
71861,2,"Its ok I tried using it, it covers bald spots and also gets on everything in the room. So I guess if you want to clean up the whole bathroom after use this is for you."

170234,0,I like china glaze ok. it bubbles sometimes which i don't like. However I am not a fan of the liquid leather top coat. i've used it a few times and it makes the polish a different color or something. i don't like how it changes the color. I'd go with Seche Vite ... much better and dries really fast.

70971,0,"Having searched for this product in the UK for some time for my mother-in-law I gave up and purchased from a US company; this resulted in having to pay 3 times what the product was worth in postage even though it weighed so little. It arrived promptly but the product did not appear as it had on the web page. The picture on the front was different. My mother in law was pleased as she had been looking for this talc for a long time. I was, however, disappointed to see when she held it up that it was only 3/4 full. This was more than natural settlement of the product and combined with the different appearance, it made me think that the product was not new although it was sold as such."

240564,1,"I go to beauty school and people come in for deep conditioners and I do the hydrafuse/kerafuse treatments. You don't need that much, this bottle will last you for probably a year. Put it on and cap your hair for 20 minutes. Works best with heat so maybe blowdry it for the 20 minutes. This mixed with Kerafuse will make hair like virgin hair in just a few treatments. Really good investment for those who color their hair a lot! But this will fade reds more quickly. Don't use often! Like once a week. :D"
50909,2,"Where do i start? I am sorry but i can't believe they designed to hair. Not only that how did it make to amazon best seller list with 300 review? HA wow! I like my hair soft shiny and wavy. Guess what? this product does the opposite. After blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell... It gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry,twinkled. The steam makes your hair raw, dry. It's like putting a water on ur hair. Do not expect compliment or anything. worry about your hair. It was like abusing my hair. The next day or after a few hour try to brush ur hair, it is really difficult. The idea of steam doesn't give the desired result. Even though i get tight curl, It was really wired curl it makes my hair away short and frizzy. You don't want that. Thanks to return policy immediately return it. If you can find a good ceramics rollers are a way better. Are there any one that agrees with me??"

116853,2,"Having used Neutrogena products before, I was comfortable with purchasing this product as when I bought it, I'd never used a sugar scrub before. It was recommended to me by a good friend, but this is definitely a case of how different skin types play a role in product selection. I have to say I'm dissappointed in this product.Scent: Maybe it's just because I've lived in Florida my whole life, but the scent wasn't sharp the way I expected from a citrus product. It had a distinctly creamy smell to me, but I was initially willing to overlook the scent.Texture: A with the scent, the feel of the scrub was also a bit creamy, and wasn't separated like some other scrubs do when they've been sitting for a bit. The consistency was smooth enough that I was a bit surprised actually.Feel: A first, it felt what a gentle exfoliating scrub should feel like, with the sugar granules small enough that they didn't cause any discomfort. The real issue for me was when I went to rinse off. As with a couple other reviewers, it was VERY oily, and I had water beading on my skin. It left me feeling greasy and uncomfortable.My skin is normally just fine without any kind of lotions, creams, or butters except on occasion. I would have to say that if you tend to need a moisturizer after showing that this might be okay for you. As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing about this product was that it's okay to use on sensitive skin. As for me, I'll stick with the ONE Sun Drenched Lemon sugar scrub that I found at Publix this past week (also available at Target, and unfortunately unseen so far here)."
164117,1,"Like many others who've reviewed this product, I LOVE IT! I discovered it about three years ago from a former neighbor who had locs and have been using it on my own unprocessed hair ever since. I also use it on my son and daughter and it makes our hair shine BEAUTIFULLY(especially in the sun!) and smells lovely! I've also used it to oil our skin. Wonderful product!"
177825,2,"I usually use the WEN Fig Cleansing conditioner and ran out. I have wavy, blonde, highlighted hair that requires TLC so decided to give this product a try. I was drawn in by the ""organic coconut milk"" and ""whipped egg whites"". I was hoping for and expecting silky soft hair but what I got instead was a matted mess of straw. I used both the shampoo which left my hair extremely rough and tangled followed by the conditioner. I was hoping the conditioner would help detangle my hair, but it did not. I had to raid my daughters bathroom for her condtioner and shampoo and re-wash my hair just to get a comb through it followed by hair shine. My hair was a frizzy mess. It DOES smell great but this isn't much help if your hair does not look great a well. I guess you get what you pay for. I will be going back to my Fig WEN."

231324,1,"This is the first Anthony product I bought and I'm really happy with it. The scent is pleasant and you get a real clean feel when using it. Just watch for pricing, because some are slightly more expensive but offer free shipping."
137291,1,"When First by VanCleef and Arpels made its debut appearance years ago it became my number one fragrance preference. In all these years I have tried a few different and new fragrances and have always retured to my old fragrance love, ""First"". It stays with me for most of the day and still smells delicious enough to get compliments about it even on an elevator. The only down side is that it is difficult to get as it doesn't sell in the states any more like it used to ... but, for me it is worth the search."
32102,0,"I've been using this product for close to 8 weeks now, going to keep trying it for another 4 to give a full set opinion. So far I've noticed a slight difference in the frown lines that start at the edge of my nose& down to the corner of my mouth. I hope it continues erase the wrinkle. No difference noticed in the line between my eyebrows yet. I will buy this product a few more times, all you need is just a bit & it goes a long way."
75265,0,"Nice iron, doesn't get hot enough for thick non-permed ethnic hair. It did absolutely nothing to my hair. I think for my hair I have to find an iron that gets at minimum 450 degrees. I think this one is about 300-350."
230723,2,"DO NOT BUY!!!This razor is a GIMMICKY and HORRIBLE design! Headblade touts their usable and trademark ""wheel"" design AS ""revolutionary"", but this is in no way easier to use than a standard razor.If you use it the way it's designed then you are only able to shave a strip of hair HALF the width of a conventional razor! I tried to redeem this purchase by using it on my face instead, but again.. it's too crapy for that, too!The only place I have left to shave is my nether-region, which this thing is not even worthy to touch. Keep your training wheels, Headblade. And scoot back to the lab to work on a better design."
174838,1,"I purchased Happy based on reviews of it here and from fragrance sites. I've been using Estee Lauder's Pleasures on and off since they first introduced it, alternating with Philosophy Pure Grace and Amazing Grace, so my comparison is mainly between those and Happy.Happy is described a floral, citrusy scent, which is not exactly the way it smells on me. I detected more of a synthetic sweetness to it, along with an almost grapefruit scent rather than the more rounded and definitely floral Pleasures and clean, fresh floral and powdery Philosophy fragrances. I had a difficult time distinguishing the floral and citrus notes separately; from the time I put it on to several hours later and sniff tests from a friend, the fragrance never changed or warmed up enough to smell any differently than it did straight out of the bottle. I also have dry skin and it's winter, and both could be the cause of the single-note results.Using the parfum spray alone and not layered with other related products like lotion, the fragrance was noticeable for about six hours on me based on my friend's nose; mine didn't detect it past an hour, which I expected since I only used a light application. This is what I'd consider a day fragrance, it's a little sharp for my taste of perfumes for evening.Buying perfume based on others' recommendations is always a shot in the dark because what's the best scent on earth to one person is a horrible, sneeze-generating odor to another. I didn't love Happy, but I don't necessarily consider it a lost cause. I'm going to try it again in the summer when my skin isn't as dry and cold.If you have the chance, I would recommend trying out Happy from someone else or the beauty counter first to get a more accurate sense of what it'll smell like on you."
181764,0,This nail polish is very thin and goes on extremely sheer. You need at least 4 coats to make it opaque and to get the color you want.
46914,0,"I first smelled Versace Bright Crystal in a department store. I sprayed it on a card, and days later it was still smelling wonderful. I decided to make the purchase (not from Amazon...I bought it at Macys) and although it was $88 for the big bottle, I thought it would be worth it because it really smells quite wonderful. The first day, however, I could not smell the perfume ten minutes after I sprayed it on my wrists. I thought that maybe I had just washed my hands too much and I washed it all off, so the next day I sprayed it on my neck AND on my wrists. I asked a coworker if they could smell it...no.Today, I coated myself in the stuff. At least six sprays (which usually would leave people gagging with a normal perfume)...nothing. I can't even smell the faintest hint of the perfume on my skin.Now, let me make it clear that I am not working outside all day in the heat, so I'm not sweating it off. I work inside, in an office, sitting at a desk. I don't understand how if you pay that much money for a perfume, it doesn't even last for one hour. I'm very, very disappointed. I love the smell, but having it last for only a few minutes is certainly not worth it."
108047,2,"Don't know if my body chemistry has changed or if the perfume was just old but I do NOT care for this any longer. Smells like an old woman and I wore it when I was YOUNG!Second disappointing fact, I paid for expedited shipping and was told product would arrive on a certain day but did not arrive until 2 day after and when I contacted the seller, there was no offer for the expedited shipping charges to be refunded to me or even a partial refund. Was overall disappointed!"
248411,0,"Smells great- like pumkin pie. doesn't seem to condition as well as i'd like. Might be good for thinner hair than mine, or hair that gets oily easily."
99725,1,"I've been using it for about 10 years. It's not clumpy, it lasts forever, it doesn't flake, it's easy to wash off (even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me :) and its affordable. I don't know what I'll do if they ever disconntinue it! LOVE THIS STUFF!"
54869,2,"Similarly, I ordered a bottle of D&G; Light Blue 3.4 oz for Women from seller ESSK Enterprisesbut the perfume is of bad quality.Probably they are adulterated."
198642,0,"My wife purchased one of these to use at home , she was so happy with the results from it she bought one for my daughter , after about 9 months both of them starting having problems not heating up. I took both of them apart and the power cords were bad ,To a handy-man this might not sound like a big deal but it is, The cords are special and you can not purchase them separately , I have called several places and Looked on the internet and no body sells them ,You can send the unit in for repair but with the repair cost and shipping you will pay over $40 minimum to replace the cord, While looking on the internet for a cord ,I found a lot of people complaining about the cords going bad so quickly."
126581,0,"The seller is wonderful and fast in shipping. Although this is not the Il Bacio that I remember. The smell is a little weak. I used to wear this fragrance back in the 90's and men would flock to me wanting to know what I was wearing. That's not the reason that I purchased it though. I purchased this because I loved the way it used to smell fresh yet elegant, sexy and refined. This used to be my special occasion fragrance and that's what I purchased it for. I have since found a new fragrance for special occasions and just use the Il Bacio as a go too for everyday use. Such a shame because I was wanting this sooooo badly since I knew it was hard to find. Good Luck I hope it works for you if you decide to purchase anyway!"
117241,0,"Ok I used it as a prank gift for my boyfriend (24 B-day), and it was pretty funny, but as far as the product quality, it's a very cheap soap, it has a weird concistency, It's a soap that you don't feel soo clean after using it, I'd say it is just like a back up soap, for that unfortunate day that you run out of you regular shower soap and you are already in the shower"
224501,1,"I have curly hair and it's a mess to straighten them...but this thing works like magic for me...The best feature is that you dnt need a dryer to dry your hair first and then straight..!! you can easily select the optio ""wet to dry"" all in all just love it..!!"
236351,1,"I bought this polish because I've never seen anything like it. This sheer shade of blue with pink and silver pieces of glitter in different sizes. I wasn't disappointed. Though you need to put more than the average 2 coats on and apply it more generously onto the nail, the polish is fabulous. I always get so many compliments when using any of her glitter polishes.Just know that you will need to add more coats and blot the glitter over the nail to get the maximum amount instead of just brushing it down your nail like with normal polish. It takes a little bit more time. I tend to like to use the polishes on my own rather than at a nail salon as they don't have much patience and I end up with just a few specks of glitter on each nail.Using this polish with a nude base coat seems to work best for me because it makes the blue pop more."
168312,0,"The product was just delivered yesterday. Applied the polish to my nails and it was MUCH darker than the polish in the picture. After doing some research, the polish advertised in the picture is actually Chine Glaze Aquadelic. I will not be sending this one back, I still like the color, but it is much darker than I expected. It looks a little funny since I have a paler skin tone. It is also a matte finish. I expected a shiny finish since the polish is called ""china glaze"". The color is still pretty, but it definitely needs a top clear coat to make it shiny. If you want the polish color advertised in the picture, look up China Glaze Aquadelic polish."
50538,1,"This file is so phenomenal that I will probably never use nail clippers again. It makes quick and easy work of filing and doesn't leave that ragged ""underside"" of the nail like other files do. I prefer natural nails at a very modest length, and this OPI file really makes it a breeze to keep them just the length I like. Try it, you'll love it!"
216398,0,"I'm 51, and I consider myself moderately stylish. Sorry to step on any toes, but this fragrance would certainly not be considered stylish in today's culture. When it was created in 1968, I suspect it was at the top of its class. But times have changed. I have Puig's Quorum Silver and wear it during the day. I really enjoy its masculine, spicy cedar notes. However, Agua Brava comes at you from a completely different direction. It's a very heavy scent, something that harkens back to the Bonanza / Brady Bunch era, with strong woody, musk, and sage notes. If that's your preference, then Agua Brava is the one for you. However, if you want to distance yourself from your grandfather's fragrances, or father's for that matter, you might want to go with something a bit more modern."
100976,1,"This oil smells smooth and it has a soothing affect for me ' A little bit goes a long way as well ' Great oil, I love it '"
201751,1,"Overall I would rate this 4 stars. The product came intact, wrapped very nicely in bubble-wrap and was not opened or spilled. The color is displayed a little brighter in the picture than it is when you see it in real life. It takes about three coats in order to get the color to show up on your nail and not have your nail show through under the polish."
87032,0,"This product was very easy to use. The instructions were simple and easy to follow. Once on, the sticker didn't bother me. The final results seemed to be very sporadic and unpredictable. On one occasion it worked very well and two other times it seemed to make the condition worse."
80208,0,"I've loved Gai Mattiolo since the 1990's but it's a shame to say this product arrived and the spray seemed old like it had been sitting on the shelves since the 1990's. The place I got this was great as far as sending me another one but I have to say the next one was the same ""old"" quality. I just think the brand stopped doing well and they have had these products sitting on the shelves for really long time."
116511,2,"I had this flat iron for about 6 months and mine too burned out. It also damanged my hair so much! I bought a ceremic one after this on broke, and noticed a big difference in my hair. My hair was so damanaged from this iron that i had trouble putting highlights (bleach) in my hair cause my hairstylist was afraid my hair would break. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! If you dont want to spend a lot of money, get the Vidal Sasoon Gold 2.25&quot; Ceremic high heat straightner VS182C. That one made my hair look and feel healthy again, but my just burned out after 6 months, so now im going to upgrade to an expensive on at my salon."
42047,0,"this was such a good sponge. soft, extremely absorbent but it lasted about two months and was in pieces. so maybe i didnt do all the special care etc e.g. soak in baking soda every now and then etc but even then, two months is a pretty short time for a ten dollar sponge."
58151,2,"This honeybee nail polish flaked off first day I put it on, and the honeybee nail polish remover doesn't work either. Don't waste your time on trying these.I thought I had found a great product, I am sensitive to strong smells, but guess I will just have to go outside to put on my horrible smelling regular nail polish and when I use my horrible smelling polish remover."
45109,0,"I actally thought the smell would be great because of the product but it was not all it turned out to be. I bought it for my man and he just pushes it aside like nothing, oh well, maybe I will try another kind."
53087,1,"I discovered Deci-Dela in Italy, where I fell in love with it, because it captured the smell of the white wine and peaches we had every day in Amalfi. While not as well-known as other Nina Ricci perfumes, it is very special indeed, and says Summer to me."
72857,0,"this is a face wash from heaven. for some reason it is the only product that does not give me an allergic reaction. smells great, removes eye makeup...very important.it's inconveniently in a bottle that leaves at least a tablespoon or two of product at the bottom. it requires tremendous effort to remove (inverting it for days and catching it before it falls out as you put it in your hand). you'd think for $35 someone at the company could work this out."
46056,2,"I purchased this cologne based upon the reviews. I tried in after great anticipation when it arrived in the mail. I was completely disappointed. It smells like lemon pledge and the smell faded within seconds. I even sprayed like 4 times to see if maybe the bottle needed to be stirred up a little, but no luck.I think most of these reviews are fake. This is the weakest cologne I have ever owned. I think I'm going to go with something a bit more expensive."
157807,1,I have very fair skin and have never been able to tan. This product is amazing! I put it on every day in the summer and look like I have a nice tan. Its so nice not to have to walk around with pasty white skin in the summer anymore!
101544,2,"I don't know what is in these bottles that I received, but it is not shatter polish. I purchased black and white shatter. Both polished on like white out. The result was not even close to how it was supposed to be. I have had crakle and shatter polish done before, so I know how it should look. I wasted my money on this. I would've been better off going into a retail store to buy it. Can someone tell me what went wrong with this company?? What is in these bottles that I have?? It sure isn't shatter polish!!"
156049,0,"I have heard raves and raves about this product but it didn't work for me. I was trying to stop coloring and allow my existing grey to shine as white instead of yellow and OMGoodness, I had six colors going on in my head (because I wasn't dying) and the white never did shine white, so I resumed coloring. On the otherhand, my mother-n-law uses this and has the most beautiful, white hair that you ever want to see so &#34;it works for her!&#34; Her hair is noticably whte witih a silver shine and she says that you can't leave this on but for 60 -70 seconds or so otherwise will give blue tint (which eventually wears off). She loves it!"
239331,1,"I was ecstatic to find this perfume! I had originally purchased it at a department store and then was not able to find it until I checked on Amazon. This is a wonderful light, clean smelling fragrance which I love. Lucky for me to be able to find it again!"
150154,1,"I love this color of Glazewear!!!! I want to have this product brought back for purchase. I have written Avon because they took it off the market. I buy this in quantities because I wear it all the time, every day, 365 days of the year. It goes with everything. It DOES NOT smell funny and it doesn't taste funny either. It is the absolute best. Wish I could buy more!!! When will Avon understand that this color is one that will sell??? (Hey Avon, Did you notice the rating is 4.6 out of 5)??"
28874,0,It smells really bad! Apart from that it's good enough to wear alone but I have got quite good skin.
187973,0,Good iron. Sometimes turns off or takes a few times to turn on. Overall it's a good curling iron. Happy with my choice. The barrel width is a little bigger than I'm used to.
44124,1,"Found this on amazon, it was the best deal so far online. I have used it 1 time so far, and it was really easy to use. Just don't cut too much at first or you might regret it."
134891,2,"The first (and only) time I tried to use it, it melted the plastic tip and burned my hair, even though I didn't have it on the hottest setting. I had to rake through my hair to get the pieces that had been burned off."
17190,1,"I'm not just talking about the price, either. I can't stand Channel or pretty much any other perfume, but I like Poison. It is more floral than alcohol."
28358,2,I use to love this perfume. This has an old smell to it. Service was great just doesn't smell good
240192,1,Love the products but it took a little longer than normal to get. But everything was in great condition. So no big complaining here!
91934,0,"The product was okay, but takes a bit longer then I like to get it the gray covered. It also sometimes pulls your hair, because the lipstick like color is very hard not like lipstick, but all in all it helps."
208081,1,"I buy one of these probably every 6 months. Great product experience so far. The aroma isn't too strong, the feeling of your skin after a bath using it is great, and the lid serves as a decent portion size. Not sure if it says on the side but would recommend putting most under the faucet to dissolve more quickly and then some throughout rest of tub so it circulates easier."

157494,2,"I was so hopeful for this product after reading the other reviews. I love the Dermadoctor Ain't Misbehavin' cleanser and anti-acne serum. However, I used this product twice and will be returning it to Sephora. I have very oily skin and acne. After cleansing and application of the acne serum, I applied this product. It did not absorb at all! It balled and flaked up on my skin, making me look like I had wiped cottage cheese on my face. I ended up having to wipe it off with a towel. Also, it had that cheap Coppertone kind of smell, which I can't stand. I thought maybe I didn't wait long enough after application of the acne serum, so the next day I gave it a good 15-20 minutes between application of the acne serum and this product, and the same thing happened. I got no mattification whatsoever, and the same extremely gross cottage-cheese type chunkiness. Maybe it's just something to do with my particular skin, but I was very disappointed, and will be exchanging for the Cosmedicine Medi-Matte 20 SPF lotion which I *know* works."
1625,0,I do not notice any difference between this (expensive) and a normal over the counter luminous highlighter. I do not think I will purchase again.
34554,0,"This hair dryer does what I need it to do, but I think the loud sound it makes when running is damaging to my hearing. The first time I used it, my ears were ringing for hours afterward. Product works, but highly recommend ear protection."
237883,1,"I first learned about this product while I was on a Yoga & Meditation Retreat. The owner of the retreat used this product for everything (dishes, cleaning, bathing etc.)I was surprised to see how little goes a long way.I love this product because it smells great, it's 100% organic and it always leaves my skin feeling super clean. Now, about the peppermint...hmmm...the scent is extremely strong because it's real peppermint...and we all know what peppermint does when you put it on your skin...it tingles a bit, refresh it etc.So I guess it's no surprise that when used in the most private areas, it tingles as well, but it's a pleasant one :)"
32814,0,"I used Frownies for a few weeks but every time I took them off I had a pink triangular patch of irritated skin in the center of my forehead. The irritation disappeared after a few hours and I saw some modest improvement to my deep worry wrinkles. The results were temporary. As soon as I stopped using Frownies, the wrinkles returned. I found a much better product that is giving me much better results without any irritation: Curad Scar Therapy treatment. It's a silicone film that you can cut into triangular shapes and apply the same way as a Frownie. It is designed to cure scars and it works much better than the Frownies."
209683,0,"Its okay, but it really did not do much for me. This product ok because it cleared up some of my marks, other than that its ok."
96214,1,"I recently had the Keratin Express treatment applied to my hair at the salon. This treatment removes about 99% of frizz from your hair and lasts about 4-7 weeks. You ABSOLUTELY must use a sulfate-free shampoo & conditioner with this treatment, as sulfate will immediately reverse the keratin and you will be out a lot of $! I had never heard of a 'Luxury' conditioner before, but this stuff rocks! It smells great and is nice and thick. I have the thickest hair around and after using this conditioner, I can run my fingers through my wet hair! Soooo awesome, you must try! Like the label says - Enjoy!"

113300,0,"The Farouk CHI is too big, too heavy, and comes in black only. I had a nice little dryer, Perfection Compact 1600 Model#H53C-0298 that was compact (with folding handle), light weight, and white. It lasted for a long time.The one good thing about the Farouk CHI is that it is very quiet. I just hope it will also last a long time."
52760,0,"This left my skin (and tub) feeling greasy, rather than moisturized. The fragrances were OK, nothing spectacular. I tried the Pink Grapefruit which was more sweet than tart, the Cinnamon which had more vanilla and clove than cinnamon and the Sweet Organge which smell of a fresh, citrus grove. The presentation is cute, but frankly at $7 apiece, I expected a little more. I'll stick with my favorites by Haute Tub or Lush rather than purchase these again."
103318,0,"Personally, I didn't like the product, but it was a gift to my sister, and she really loved it. She has been using this product for more than 5 years. It arrived earlier than scheduled, in perfect conditions."

Love the sweet candy-like smell and it stays on, smelling good all day long.It smells so sweet that the almost invisible little sugar ants I'm trying to get rid of were actually drawn to it. Thanks to those who suggested spraying it in freshly-washed hair, my hair smells great too!"
30381,0,Cant say i like to don't like this Optimum Care Multi-Mineral Relaxer Super 14.1 oz. Jar as it arrived open and couldn't be used.
178774,0,"This relaxer is OK. It does the job if you use enough of it. However, it will not last for very long and it will dry out your hair a LOT.You might wanna invest in professional hair styling if you want straighter hair without breakage."
228446,0,This is my husband's signature fragrance so of course we love Hugo. This review gets a three-star b/c when the 5 oz bottle arrived the packaging was without the plastic wrapping. The box looked a little worse for wear. I was not too sure why. The bottle was full though and the fragrance is authentic - it smells right and lasts as long as it should. May be it was some kind of overstock item but amazon did not specify that (if it is indeed the case) when I placed the order online.
10917,0,its very good a strong head band thick metal and it silk very big bandana size so its good to fit almost every one
26469,1,"This is the best product I ve ever ever used...now cant live without it....however, I have fine short hair, and I still have to use a lot of it ...so the price tag doesn t help really...I just got it and I m searching the web for a cheaper price than the $26 price tag!! anyway...The product is GREAT if you can afford it."
36232,0,"If I were to create a shampoo, this has all of the ingredients I would use. However, it left my hair feeling like straw and I had to use a lot of conditioner afterward. If you are looking for a healthy shampoo, you should try it. There are not many shampoos made with such high quality ingredients as this one is."
16683,0,"I regularly use Alba's lotions so was excited to try this. I've been using it for about a week and like it--it smells good and has a nice lather; however it's left terrible soap scum in my shower. I'll use the remaining bottle, but will be cleaning a lot more often until it's gone."
60319,1,I really like the Essie nail polish line. You get a great polish for the price. I rated this color a 4 only because it is a translucent pink and I wanted more coverage of a light pink then a clear pink. If you like a light pink/clear polish look then this is perfect for you.
121591,0,"I was a bit disappointed with this product, yet, at the same time I will probably buy it again. I have medium-brown hair with some light brown at the front and tips. It's a bit past my shoulders. I have a bit of gray hair at my temples - it's not super noticable unless I pull my hair back, but it's way too much to just pluck. Before using this I had never colored my hair before because I wanted to avoid the nasty chemicals and upkeep.It was very easy to use (shampoo, blot dry, apply, let sit, then wash out and use conditioner). I followed the chart, and I think I let is sit about 30 minutes. It was a good thickness so it didn't drip at all, and it didn't leave any stain behind on my hairline (I did apply vaseline to my hairline) or in my shower. I used maybe 3/4 of a bottle for my hair. This company has a video on Henna application online that may be helpful for first-timers like me.End result: Most, but not all, of my grays turned into a sort of gold (not blond, not brown) color. They didn't look like highlights, but they didn't stick out like gray hair anymore- they just sorta blended in with the rest of my hair. There were a handful of white hairs that stayed totally white, even though I think I applied it pretty evenly. The areas of my hair that were very light brown before (the front and ends) seemed a bit darker brown to me, and it did seem like it gave it a bit of a reddish hue. I did not have a single person, except my husband, notice the change! But I don't think many people noticed my grays before either. But I felt like I looked better because the grays weren't noticable any more. I didn't notice that my hair quality changed at all - it didn't get silkier or anything, but I didn't have badly damaged or dry hair to start with.After ~3 weeks of washing with regular shampoo every other day, it has washed out maybe ~80%.So, for a lazy gal like me it's a bit of work to not cover grays completely or last very long. But, I still dislike my grays and I am not ready for harsh chemicals, so I do plan on using it again to tide me over until I have more grays. I might also wait and use it again before a special occasion."

226022,1,"Pretty little thing but its abit heavy. However, it makes a nice present to girlfriends on their birthdays or even anniversary if they are a fanatic of Dior.Lip gloss colour is really nice and i really like it!"
34521,0,This is a nice dryer to have IF you have short hair AND you do not want to set your hair with rollers. The bonnet just isn't deep enough. It's almost too shallow for my short hair cut. I have to move my head around to get heat on all parts of my hair.That said it suits its at home purpose ok. If Conair would design one with a deeper hood bonnet (even if it cost more)this product would be excellent! As is-it's just ok.
171334,0,"The dryer is okay, its easy to hold, great looking. But the attachments are really no good. The combs are very very sharp and hurt your scalp if you run it over your scalp by mistake. The brush attachment is losing all its bristles already (and I have used it only once till now.)Its okay for the price, but if you want to buy a hairdryer for its attachments, dont buy this one."

230420,1,"I got this product because my husband has a skin problem where his head itches at certain times really badly and nothing helps. He could actually feel the tingling and knew how well it cleaned his scalp. It made him feel so clean. His head doesn't itch and he doesn't use it everyday, just when his head starts to itch. This is a great product and I highly recommend it."

163271,1,"Definately recommend this product.The tea tree oil makes all the difference, but even the dye and perfume free parrafin wax made by gigi and home medics is great too"
92143,2,Lasts 5 minutes if you're lucky. Cracks almost immediately. It actually takes much longer to apply and dry than it lasts/looks nice. Don't waste your money.
9144,1,"MY SISTER SEEMS TO LIKE THE GIFT THAT I BOUGHT HER. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE JADORE BY DIOR PARFUM THAT I PURCHASED ALSO HAD SPARKLING GLITTER IN THE BOTTLE. I GUESS IT'S A SPECIAL EDITION ONE OR SOMETHING. ANYWAYS, THE SELLER SHIPPED ON TIME AS PROMISED SO THAT IT WAS UNDER OUR TREE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING! I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THANKS AGAIN."
173931,0,"I got the bath Trio. It comes with a candle which smells super nice. The Creme Brulee Honey bath has a nice scent. It doesn't last very long though nor do the bubbles. The body lotion is a ""Zero Star"" item. When my friend wrinkled his nose after I had put some on I knew this product was a definate no go. I threw it away in the end. I also had bought the sugar scrub. It just smells alright however, it is extremely moisturizing.Products that have a wonderful scent that I recommend would be ""Japanese Cherry Blossom"" by bath and body. Or Valentino is a super nice light scent for those that can not wear a stronger scented perfume."
174501,0,Its good. But has a blank side. Does not mention this in the listing. Use for buffing before applying gel nail polish.
244218,1,"I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant. I use it along with a moisturizer each night. It tingles at times, but not to any extreme. It is not greasy or too heavy, but seems to last on my skin throughout the night. Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin! I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother. For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature. I have found a product in Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant that I will purchase again and again."
66165,1,"My hairdresser used this on my, and I immediately came home and looked it up on line. Amazon, of course, had the best price. This small size was exactly what I wanted for travel, and I got a lot of use out of it."
166640,0,"This is one of my favorite scents, especially for the price range. The problem is that the longevity is about 30 minutes and there is almost no projection. I would stockpile about 10 bottles of this stuff given the current price and the fact that they are no longer producing it, expect for the fact that it needs to be reapplied every 30 minutes for people to even notice you're wearing it. If your skin holds scents extremely well and enhances projection then this might be worth every penny. I don't know to suggest this to everyone or no one..."
141347,2,"I bought this to hold a low cut dress in place. It did not work as expected, I followed the directions but it didn't hold any material in place. I would not recommend this product."
48564,2,I am very disappointed with the REVLON Paraffin bath. It takes longer than the instructed ninty minutes to heat up and it doesn't get very warm. Even after 2 hours the paraffin was only slightly warm and did not stay on my hands. I wished I had read reviews before I made my purchase. I would not recommend that anyone waste money on this item.
179118,0,"This is a very lovely color, I just wish it weren't so watery and didn't require 3 layers to reach optimal pigmentation."
29082,0,"When I opened and applied the perfume at first, I was thrilled with the soft smell. I'd thought I found the right perfume for me. The next day and ever since, when I use it I can't smell much, just the hint, and only if I put my nose very close to the wrist and sniff it well. The smell is still very nice, but it's barely detectable to almost nonexistent."
40677,0,"I got a few samples of these after an ulta salon facial burned my face. I am happy with this product, not with the facial but thats another story. I wouldnt ever pay more than $20-25 for a bottle of this stuff because I like barrier repair more and ill splurge on that. It is cool stuff though, felt nice. If you have the money to blow on stuff then go ahead, you wont be dissapointed"
161436,2,"I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord. First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out. Second hotel, same thing. I didn't use it the rest of our trip. I tried it again when we got home. As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked. In the trash it went. Big waste of money,"
39107,0,"I bought the Fair and White Fair & White Lait Corps Exclusive Whitenizer Body Lotion. The first three I bought from ""Beauty in Black"" were excellent, and so I ordered four more from them.Now one of the four from ""Beauty in Black"" smells weird, odd and is kinda oily. Huh??? I am making another order from this seller hoping that the one weird one was a mistake. This last order was three and I thought all of them would be just as good.So far I have had good experiences with this company, ""Beauty in Black"", and do not want this last one to change my opinion. So I have made another order hoping that it will not be my last.If this next order does not have the same good quality in the last four that I bought proceeding this weird oily feeling one, I will not buy from them again.They were so good, I honestlyyyyy hope this last single weird one was just a mistake fluke. When I get my next order, I will comment on it and say if it was good or bad. Lets wait and see.So for now, I have bought 7 ""Fair and White Fair & White Lait Corps Exclusive Whitenizer Body Lotion"" from ""Beauty in Black"" which worked well and one odd one which smells weird, feels oily and sticky. I do not know what to make of this sudden inconsistency so I decided to give them another try.The quality of products I get will determine my patronage of this seller."
220756,1,"Great scent for daily wear, similar but superior to Aqua Di Gio and Aqua Di Parma. After it warms up it's very mellow and lasts for a long time. A great ""secret"" fragrance not widely available. Suitable for the office."
205207,2,This mini size is just too small. I ordered 3 of the items and wanted to return them but I took them FOREVER to get back to me how to return them. All in all it was a not a good buying experience for me.
173770,1,"Bliss makes the best hand creams. I got this one for my friend in Montana who struggles with finding enough moisture for her skin there. The pepper & orange fragrance is my favorite but this basic one is great too, a slight citrus scent."
205889,1,"This stuff really does work. I was worried that you could only paint one coat of actual nail polish/color before using this top coat, but in reality I did two coats (pretty thick ones at that), waited the two minutes and boom, dry to the touch. This is well worth the price seeing as before I would have to literally wait hours for my polish to fully dry or end up accidentally smudging them somehow. Truly amazing."
137656,0,"The nail polish is OK, I thought it was going to be more shocking pink neon, but not, it is a normal pink."
139410,0,"Despite the package description there is no stand on this appliance, nor is one included as a separate piece. It is large and bulky, but for the most part -- it works."
194994,1,"Just ordered 4 bottles from buy.co_ for $25.96 w/free ship. Amazon needs to stay on top of prices, I hate to have to shop hard when I used to believe amazon was as good as it gets. Tighten up amazon."
203683,2,I saw the infomercial and was sold. Then I heard a woman as Sephora swear by it so I purchased it right away. I have natural 4A textured hair and this cleansing cream did absolutely nothing for me. It was gooey and hard to work through. It was also difficult to rinse out and left a coating on my hair that I didn't like. It was also matted and made my curls look lifeless. I returned immediately and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
112847,0,"You would think it would be simple to find a good squirt bottle. Boys and girls, it is not. The Tolco 8 oz proves it once again. It's not bad, really. The top hasn't disintegrated in my hand like the last squirt bottle I bought. Empty or near empty, it wants to tip over. (Which is not cool at all.) It would be nice to be able to choose which colors you get. I bought three, for separate purposes, and ended up with two pink and one black. I'll use them for now, but I haven't found squirt bottle nirvana. Maybe it doesn't exist. I just think it should."
166927,2,"I couldn't tell you if it works because it smells so bad, you can't use it. I tried the first day and I smelled all day at work. Then I read the instructions and it recommends that you put it on at night and then shower in the morning. That means you will get it all over your bedding. I would not recommend this product. Very disappointing"
173477,0,Well unless they kept sending me the wrong straightener then here is the problem. No place in the box or on the product does it say steam. I got two because I sent the first back thinking they sent me the wrong one... unfortunately they sent the same one again. I think it may have been a good straightener but it didn't do STEAM and that is maily why I was purchasing this item. Perhaps they did send me the wrong one twice... I will never know since I sent both back and never used either. I wanted Steam and that was something it doesn't do...
235225,0,"Let me say first that I'm not really the kind of person that just post negative reviews on products I don't like.The product came today by UPS, which was pretty fast considering the estimate dates they gave me and when I got the box I was able to shake the compact, hearing it hit side to side, so obviously they don't pack their products too well. I tried the product as soon as I opened it because I wanted to see if it worked well, I was a little disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this product because it left me an ashy look. Don't get me wrong, it applied smooth and had a smooth finish but it had an ashy look as well.. I think I'm going to return it, if I can and get something different.Ok, this is additional. Just a tip for who ever still wants to buy this product. It works well, if you apply moisturizer before adding the makeup and it will take the away the ashy look! I tried it and I feel so much better and I don't have to replace it, by returning or buying the liquid instead."
2394,2,"This is the third differnt shower mirror I've purchased over the years. This one, like the other two, worked great for about four months. After that time it became more and more difficult to keep clear and a month or so later was completly ""fogged"" even without the shower running.For $20 I don't expect much.... However, it would be nice to get at least a year out of these mirrors."
156027,2,"there is a similar brand at sally's that works well, However this one in particular does not stay on your head. It moves around under the wig cap."
73837,2,"i was hoping to get a head band not a tonytail, but it was my fault when ordering, but when I try to use thiss itss likee soooo difficultt to make the tail. I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL"
51667,2,"I have used this product for years and very familiar with it's long lasting fragrance and scent. When I first used this product I purchased online though Amazon, I noticed within a half hour, I could no longer smell the scent of the cologne? I continued to use on and off for a couple of weeks and again within a half hour I couldn't even detect the fragrance and friends and family confirmed NO scent at all. I'm completely dissapointed with my purchase and would NOT order Chrome from Azzaro through Amazon again!!I will say in Amazon's defense, they did refund my total purchase for this item ;-)"
213862,2,A complete rip off. It is foggier than the foggiest day in Fogland. Only buy if you like fog and want a shaving mirror that fogs up before anything else in the bathroom.
112877,0,"Pretty good brush. However, handle was a little too short for my liking, as I have sore shoulders issues. Also, I would have preferred a rounded handle, which would have made it more comfortable when reaching over my shoulders. Handle kept cutting into my thumbs during use. But, overall a quality product. Would recommend."
148959,1,"wife uses this product & has almost no wrinkles, so I keep buying it for her....cheaper than a new wife."
138445,2,If you look on lid it says 85 grams. It should say 100 grams for 3.53 oz. which is boldly shown in title of product. Thought this was too cheap for the amount and now I know why. Was shipped fast but like I said not the correct amount was received.
76037,0,"After a rough and tumble week sampling a number of sweet scents du jour (WD With Love, Escada Moon Sparkle, BS Fantasy, JS Fancy, Halle, Angel), I starting wondering if I ought to go out an get me a bottle of liquid confection. OMG!!! What was I thinking? I searched through my fragrance cabinet looking for something to snap me out of this twilight-zone sugar-rush, and I pulled out ... SJP Lovely.Yes, Lovely it is. An ADULT, contemporary & classic fragrance for a WOMAN who has BTDT and knows what SHE wants out of life. Coming down from this olfactory sugar high, I clearly detect sweetness in Lovely at a reasonable level, just enough to satisfy my taste for sweet scents. My reacquaintance with Lovely confirmed that there was no need to purchase liquid sugar and walk around smelling like 45-year-old cotton candy. Thank you, SJP.What can I say about Lovely that hasn't been said before? Lovely is among the best celeb fragrances to-date, very wearable, not offensive, sample-worthy for most, and full-bottle-worthy for many. It could have been called Beautiful, but that was already taken. Lovely is a bit romantic, suitable for date-nights, bedtime, weekends, but not the office imo. Spray lightly for intimate settings, more heavy-handed for public gatherings & wide-open spaces.Thank goodness for Lovely. Pull it out of your closet and rediscover its sweetness."
4296,0,"The Tangerinetherapy Body Lotion smells great!! That said, I found that the lotion was not thick enough and it didn't last all that long before you felt like you had to reapply. I don't think I'd buy it."
211995,0,Product was as well as I expected but I saw no real benefits to using it.
225313,2,"This flat iron is crap. I have thick hair, it's currently the only flat iron I have, and it takes several swipes to get it moderately straight. I've never gotten it actually flat with this iron, just ""styled"" I guess. It does well for now, since I have nothing else, but seriously DONT BUY THIS!!!"
47281,0,This product has a very strong perfumey fragrance that I don't like at all. The color is also a little off-putting (grayish/purple) but I can live with that. I have very senstive skin and can't use something with so much fragrance. I switched to Loreal Deep Set Wrinkle Night Cream and am much happier with it.
103506,1,My brother-in-law was so right. This item is much better than any soap on the market today.Very easy on the skin....no harsh after effects.I have made a second bulk purchase of this item.The cost is well worth the benefits provided by this item.It is named very correctly............:&#34;cleansing bar.&#34;
133483,0,THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL TO KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE. THE OUT POINT IS ITS OILY. I STOPPEDUSEING IT AND LOST LOTS OF HAIR. TOO LATE NOW TO USE AGAIN. ONCE U START DONT STOP!IT DOES WORK.
146977,1,This product is amazing. Hint: use a 1/2 inch sponge paint roller right after you spray to even it out. Last about 6 days.
103738,2,"It looks like a a leather type product, but upon arrival, I was very disappointed to see it. It's made of some cheap plastic that can be easily torn. At the same time, you can expect much, since it was very cheap. Spend a little more and get something nicer. I threw mine away."
49945,2,"Anyone's hair turning out AS DRY AS THE DESERT about 2 - 3 days after using this? I have medium course fine density hair. when i put this on at first it's good but 2 - 3 days later, my hair ends up being dry and brittle, as i have never seen it before in my whole life, breaking off like crispy crackers and i end up needing to do an emergency deep conditioning treatment with real products like avlon fiberguard positive links and 5 in 1 which is unbelievably good for our hair and absolutely made for black hair care! sometimes i put the ojon on my hands (at first i hated the smell but i don't know what happened cuz now i wish they made a perfume of it) and rub it in and the same thing happens to my hands, 2 days later my cuticles are all peeling and the skin on my hands is dry and crackling. i'm seriously not exaggerating and i've tried every combo (leave it on, wash it off, pile it on, use a tiny bit) but nothing absolutely nothing works for me.) it's so weird but i really don't think that this product is good on black people's hair. our hair needs extreme moisture and ojon products ROB my hair of every ounce of moisture about 2 days after treatment. i'd be interested to hear if this is happening to anyone else-- if the initial honeymoon of this product has warn of anyone and they see something like this happening to them. believe me when i say, i'm really quite sad that it's not working for me because i had no buyers remorse regarding price whatsoever. i don't know if i just got a bad batch, a tub of the ""old"" formula (mine does not have the little beads in it like the sample i was given had)or what but it is just complete trash, just sitting there $45 dollars worthless tub of yummy smelling nothing. p.s., i have a very loud intuition and no offense, but i don't believe that hyped out story about him working with and helping the tribe and sustainably taking the palm oil etc etc. not for one second. it's just not possible to sell on QVC and be small potatoes like that. I've read some seriously conflicting reports about sustainability issues. my intuition says this guy is just a marketing guy, i mean does he even have a cosmo license??? his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality."
62468,1,"When I first purchased this product, I was less then thrilled. No plumping. But it was a nice lip moisturizer. Over the winter, I started having some chapped lip issues, so I began to put the product on in the mornings before leaving the house and at night before going to bed, just as a moisturizer. I didn't even use it during the day. Low and behold, within a couple of weeks, I really started noticing a difference. I would have given it five stars for effectiveness, however, I feel like the advertising is misleading. It isn't a one shot miracle product. It requires a bit of discipline. I believe that the difference between those who get results with this product and those that don't may just be consistency of use."
249830,2,"This dry shampoo may help with doggy odor, but it is so messy that I only used it once. The dry powder gets everywhere and continues to get on everything after lots and lots of brushing. It only helps with the doggy smell for a short time, too. For me, it wasn't worth the mess."
89740,2,Dont notice any changes...the dark circles have slightly lightened..but not a product I would be willing to buy again.:(
20111,0,I have had a Conair straightening brush for years and loved it! When it broke I couldn't find another one in stores so purchased on line. The brush I received is not the same as the one I had before or as pictured. The bristle base is much wider on the new one and it doesn't collapse for easy storage. I haven't used it yet - so can't speak to how it performs. Hopefully it works just like my old one - which was GREAT while using my flat iron.
170756,1,I have had this color on my toe-nails for weeks! It is the best Tiffany Blue I could find and I love it. I get tons of compliments and it hasn't even started to chip. I will need to re-apply it soon since it is growing out!
81901,2,I don't care for the smell of this at all. I was hoping to find something comparable to Hypnotic Poison. This isn't it.
98834,2,"Rollette form is convenient for carrying and applying. Scent of grapefruit, however, remains only briefly when first applied.Would guess that consistency needs a stronger blend of the citrus-derived oil for grapefruit mercaptan to sustain the scent.If there is a rating scale that indicates how long aroma in this product continues/projects and this rollette form was rated, I would have like to have known before I purchased it. Essential grapefruit oils available in health food stores and stores like Whole Foods/My Organic Mom, for instance, carry a stronger fragrance and are usually less than half the cost of this rollette.The appearance is cute and I'll use it until finished but I wouldn't buy it again or give it as a gift."
160296,1,These are a tad bigger than the triel size in the stores but will last me a very long time.
149832,2,I've used it for 2 months. Does not work. Maybe because I am a guy. I don't know. For me it is just a garbage.
39664,1,"I use these in my dark brown medium length hair. I think they're great. They come in fun colors and a long enough length that you can trim it to your length. The clip takes a little practice, but once you gt the gist it stays in very well, and lies flat enough that the clip isn't noticeable. The clip is a small curved comb that clips open and closed. The trick is to make sure that the comb is grabbing your roots. It sure beats permanent color and is much more versatile."
1127,0,"I bought this item at Target for the same price as Amazon. (I thought Amazon would have a better price.) When I tried it out, it worked like other brush hair dryers that I have used in the past. It did well in curling and flipping out the ends of my hair, but in terms of straightening, it did a so-so job, my hair was still a little frizzy. A flat iron did a better job with straightening. I am going to return it."
33996,0,"Shiseido stopped offering this wonderful fragrance a few years back and when I saw it on Amazon I was aware that it had to be an old item. My fault for ordering it. The product arrived fast and in perfect packaging condition; however, the fragrance for being old does not hold the wonderful aroma. Shiseido fragrances last all day long, and this one was totally evaporated after a couple of hours, which indicates an old perfume bottle.It's not the seller's fault; they simply stopped fabricating this perfume and I longed for it. I still recommend the seller for the prompt delivery and excellent service; I just don't recommend purchasing a perfume that is no longer in the market because the quality won't be the same."
109817,1,Who really cares what the scent is as long as it gets your wife closer to you? It is a good values for the size of spray you get.
30082,0,"Just got this product sold from AmericaRX. The first impression is the package is not the same as shown in their ad. Instead of a big box it comes as two separate small boxes with tube inside. What's more, the label on the box says ""Anti-aging Pycnogenol Eye Gel Ideal for Sensitive Skin"", no words about Green Tea Extract on the front, and I couldn't find the exact package on DermaE's website, which really annoys me. Anyway I will start using it to see whether it works or not."
74656,0,"I purchased a 3-piece set of Demeter's fragrance which contained, Fresh Ginger, Ginseng Root, and Green Tea. Green Tea was the worst of the 3 scents, because something in it gave me a terrible headache: Trashed it. Ginseng Root has a somewhat musty, incense? smell to it: Not too bad, but I am not sure about this one. Fresh Ginger is the best of the 3 scents. Fresh Ginger has an earthy, woody, and somewhat mysterious note to it and it does NOT give me a headache....in fact, as I write this comment, I sprayed Fresh Ginger on my wrist, and LOVE the scent. It is one of the best fragrances that I have tried; however, I am not sure that it is going to be my signature scent, because whenever I wear it away from home, most people sniff at me, and noone asks me about the fragrance; so, I guess (some?) they don't particularly care for it. I think that I will try Fresh Laundry or Pure Soap next, because many people seem to give very good reviews about these fragrances: particularly Fresh Laundry.I am trying to find THEEE fragrance (or two), but I am somewhat cautious about many fragrances, because they usually give me a headache. Strangely, I thought that musk was the culprit, but I am not certain about this as I have white musk (albeit an old bottle of about 10 years which may have weakened the scent?) by The Body Shop and I tested it by spritzing on my wrist and smelled it multiple times to see what affect (if any) the musk would have towards my sinus area. Well, after a few hours of intermittent wrist-smelling, I finally had a headache. I alternatively, did this without smelling my wrist, and noticed that I had no headache. So, I guess spraying on the wrist, and probably not near the nose (neck, ears, hair) is my best bet, unless it is not just musk which gives me a headache."
78496,2,"After ordering product, company never responded. Amazon did however let me know that they were not getting a response from the company either. I never received product, nor was I charged for the product."
219559,1,"My feet have callus and in shower I just scrub my feet, feet feel smoother. Yeah!!!!! It feels better than the earth stones that you can buy the stores."
213947,1,"I had been using coconut oil on my skin as a moisturizer, make up remover, hair cream, you name it, I used coconut oil for it, but I have not tried any other natural oils, except for sweet almond oil which I tried a while back but the one I tried had a strong smell to it, so I'm so glad this one is unscented so I can add essential oils of me liking. I use this oil for body and face care and also for my hair, I love it!"
40722,1,"I'm African American. Just got Brahmi Oil in the mail today. Was anxiously awaiting its arrival and wow am delighted. I ordered this product after a ton of research to address some sudden dryness and breakage. Just recently I had some tramatic breakage after the holidays. Not sure if it were due to my having had food poisoning a couple weeks earlier in Dec, and was somewhat dehydrated and under nourished for a weeek or so, also have had significantly high stress for several months, going through peri menopause, stretching my relaxer, or maybe the breakage resulted from a combination of these things. But for more backround, I have been growing out my hair with pretty good results over the past 18 months. I started with barely enough to braid after having worn wigs for a long time. I guess I was covering it all up but the condition worsening unawares. Then I decided to just go natural and take some committed corrective measures. It was a challenge finding ways to wear it during the summer months. I tried a variety mostly organic, natural products. Now though my hair is still slightly uneven, b/c I haven't really had it trimmed, it is shoulder length and longer in some places (top and back). That is until after the holidays this year when suddenly my hair just seemed to start falling. So I was having a hair emergency. I had castor oil at home and started massaging it into my scalp while I waited for my Brahmi to arrive. Immediately, after one use today, I am thrilled. I read and followed the directions. And then put my hair up in bantu knots, not too tight. and where I could. Put on a silk scarf and went on with my daily routine. I had to go for errand and so took it down for a bit, and to my surprise already my hair was soft, shiny, full of life, I actually love the smell too, reminds me of India, which I love in many ways as well. This product resonates with me very well. With these results after just a few hours on day 1, I am poised to be totally over the moon. I will have to update you all as the journey continues. But for now, Ladies we have a 'Keeper' Love Love Love at first try."
126642,2,"Claims results in 14 days. I've been using this product for over 2 months. It has not evened my skin tone nor has it reduced fine lines. Instead, my forehead has been breaking out way more than before. And to agree with other reviews I saw on neutrogena's website, it would appear that using this product under your eyes actually creates lines, instead of erasing them."
238354,2,This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.
123354,0,"Product works well temporarily, but due to the alcohol content, it will dry out your hair over time."
79218,1,"How much can you say about a perfume?Firstly, I love the scent of this perfume. It's sweet, floral, with a tiny tiny hint of spice and drives me crazy (in a good way). The bottle has a great atomizer and gives a fine mist spray every time. Amazon has the best deal on this that I have seen, even better than Marshall's/TJMaxx if you get free shipping.I bought this for my wife for Christmas but when it came, the bottle was leaking out the top of the bottle. I alerted Amazon and they immediately sent me another bottle which arrived very quickly, in perfect condition, and in PLENTY of time for Christmas Day. I did not even have to return the damaged one, just threw it away.Thanks Diesel for putting out such a great product. Never discontinue it. Thanks Amazon for great service every time.Btw, there is a men's version of Diesel Zero Plus that is fabulous as well."

159777,0,"It has a sweet and spicy scent to it. It took some getting use to, but I really don't wear it that much."
209518,1,Very happy with product. Came exactly as advertised. Delivery was prompt. Will shop this site again.
61617,2,"It is the second time that I purchase a perfume product from Amazon.com and something is not working. This time I cannot even use the spray, because it doesn't function. I wonder if it is genuine at all."
70622,0,"I found this shampoo after suffering from scalp psoriasis for over a year. Up until that point, I had tried all the normal over-the-counter shampoos you find in drug stores (neutrogena, selsin blue, denorex, and the list goes on). This is the ONLY one that did ANYTHING at all for my condition. And within a few weeks, it had completely cleared it up. I used it every day and followed the directions, leaving it on my scalp for at least five minutes.However, after several months, the effects wore off and the symptoms returned, though not as bad as before. I still use it almost every day because I feel that it controls it somewhat but I am looking for a new product."
170096,0,"This particular color is just okay. Nothing terribly special, but cute enough. I didn't expect that it was going to be as glittery as it was, and I tend to lean more towards the solid colors -- it is a bit darker and far, far more glittery than the product image shows. As with most things, that is all taste subjective though. This color seems to take twice the time to dry that any of my others from China Glaze do, and even when I think it is good to go, I will end up smudging it somehow 30 minutes later.Bottom line: definitely cute looking, but not a favorite and not one that I would purchase again."
247015,2,"I did not like the scent of this cologne. It smelled good on my clothes, but it smelled like bug spray on me. I sent it back."
44066,0,"Well, it's ok. I thought it was bigger, but I didn't really read the size."
109845,0,Ive been using this product on scars for about 4 weeks now and I see no changes whatsoever. I also use it has a night moisturizer for under my eyes overnight and again yes its pretty moisturized but nothing special so no I won't repurchase this item.
84061,1,"Not much for using a toner. Have strayed away, but always seem to come back to Cellex-C. Yes it is pricey, but it does what it claims. The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don't hold a candle to this stuff."
50986,0,"I'm african american, it may make you a little nappy. It makes the hair kinda damp. You know what that means. You get a tight curl."
54168,0,These heat up pretty quickly and are a good size but the clips are tragic. They are hard to use and leave weird wrinkles in your hair. Considering either buying different types of clips or just returning the whole thing.
42137,0,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece. She is four years old and is having a lot of fun playing with it. It is cheaply made but arrived in nice package. I already figured it wouldn't be durable, so I was not at all disappointed."
2873,0,"These scissors are sturdy. The blunted ends are a plus. But for me, the blade length is too short. As a result, I seldom actually use these -- most of the time I select another pair from my cabinet."
113,2,"This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
114598,1,"Totally recommended! Made my weak, brittle nails strong in less and 3 days! Can apply under or over nail polish.Was a great buy!"
29608,2,"This product is awful! It comes in a 3-step system, with the shampoo being the first step. Apparently, the 1st step is all you need for thinning hair. I thought this product was supposed to HELP thinning hair?! Nope! It CAUSES it! I have thinning hair and decided to try this. Well, each time I used the shampoo, my hair started coming out in clumps! When I use Head & Shoulders shampoo, my hair is just fine. After a few tries with this Regenetresse shampoo, I knew it was the shampoo and not my hair that was the problem. So, if you want to go bald eventually, go ahead and buy this product. If you have thinning hair, however, you would have much better luck with some Head & Shoulders shampoo followed by Rogaine. The other 2 steps of the program didn't do anything for me."
111924,1,"I was very pleased to find Carmichael's Cuticle Cream for sale on Amazon. I have tried many, many other recommended cuticle conditioners and oils, but could not find one I liked as well as Carmichael's.What a pleasant surprise to find that now I can purchase it here. I also ordered extras for my daughters and feel sure this will quickly become their favorite too! The .4 oz jar does last quite a while. Please continue to stock this item! It truly is the best available, and has been the benchmark for over 30 years!"
173966,0,"I got one, it lasted 2 months. They replaced it. The replacement lasted 14 months. They won't replace it--it's out of warrantee. While it worked, it really helped my hands, but I'm not going to buy a new one every year or two. I will always need the treatments, so I will probably invest in a better-quality product."
239650,0,"Demure is a really beautiful lipstick. The color is very complimentary and something that I really wanted to like.I have pigmented, naturally rosy lips and unfortunately, Demure just doesn't show up all that well. It is barely noticeable.The formula sits nice on my lips, but I would be careful to moisturize first or else it will be drying.Although Demure is advertised as a creme, I found it to have the slightest bit of shimmer to it.I don't know how this shows up on lighter lips, but for those with darker pigmentation, Demure doesn't have enough pigmentation to be truly noticeable."
123273,0,"Not that I have a big head (!), but these are sized smaller than others for some reason."
105395,0,"The arrangement is very good, with a pair of useful storage areas beside the three dispensers. Design is very appealing (for me the satin finish looks great) and complimentary to most bath decors. My only criticisms? The plastic. I managed to drop the unit while adhering it to the wall, and instantly broke one of the compartment hinges. Blast! Before I've even implemented it, I made it something to replace! My bad, but my experience says: be aware that it is a nice dispenser, but not a lifetime appliance. Second consideration was that one of three dispensers didn't have an adequate opening to dispense a moderately viscous conditioner. I'm still working to remedy that, and will update the review based on my experience."
238730,2,"This is a fake product with a fake scent. I received the package and the ""made in China"" sticker was cut out and over it you see a small ""made in Italy"" label. Spend 10 more dollars and buy the real thing at a local store. The scent was terrible, the bottle was wrong, the scent did not stay. Terrible item and Terrible Seller!"
12247,1,"I wanted to try this product for over 4 years but just couldn't justify the cost. Finally, I broke down and bought the travel size of the shampoo and conditioner and there was just no going back. Normally, I have to spray special conditioners in my hair to get a brush through it with out screaming. I washed my hair, let it dry and then brushed it and had hardly any resistance. My hair feels stronger, thicker, more shinny and incredibly healthy. I can't stop touching it! I used to have to wash my hair every day and now I could go a day or two if I had to and I wouldn't be able to tell. I feel like a hair model! I instantly got compliments on my hair from friends that didn't even know I had switched. This is ridiculously expensive and I'll have to adjust my budget somewhere but I don't think I'll ever give it up!"
109080,0,I like this one but it don;t curl my whole hair as good. I recommened people to try it out before buying it your self
233506,0,"scent is a little strong, but bottle is cute. She probably wont use the scent in bottle, just bottle itself"
7524,1,"Well I recently went camping in a desert environment and needed something that would take less water to wash with. Whether you dilute an ounce of this Body Bath in 32 ounces of water to dip your wash cloth in or you wet your wash cloth and squirt the Body Wash directly onto the wash cloth, this stuff works great! It got me totally clean, no residue that I could notice, and my skin was soft with a nice scent afterward. I highly recommend this item for camping as well as for people that are looking for an alternative to the bath or shower."
210062,0,"I bought this as a present for my mother and she said that the scent was kind of dull, almost like it was stale. I think that I might just stick to buying perfumes in the department stores from now on."
152207,1,The Moonstruck is my favorite neutral Essie color. My order came quick and the polishes were in perfect condition. Definitely look forward to being a regular costumer.
165529,2,"What a crappy product. All packaging, no substance. The ""lotion"" is just alchol. There is no scent to speak of. At thirty five bucks a pop, this is a huge rip-off. You'd be better off buying Aqua Velva or Old Spice. This stuff is really disapointing. Don't even bother buying it as a gift for someone you don't like. It's not worth it."
161565,0,"I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the ""going out sound"" bother us. You bet it does!UPDATED: 12-30-2008Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out. Only lasted several months."
124461,0,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love the nail polish. Not to mention - the price cannot be beat! It was of the quality I expected BUT it was different than the one I had at home. I had bought it at the nail salon and fell in love with it. It goes on very sheer with a nice shimmer and is great for the summer, however, the one I had at home is not as pink as the one I ordered. So, if you're looking for a color that you already have don't be surprised if the one you order on line is a bit different. I have to say though, for the price, the slight difference in color is not a big deal."
83999,0,"I need a gel to use with Nuface Trinity on my face. I use Nuface device to glide over my face, and to lift and hold my skin during the facial treatment. So the gel needs to be pleasant to wear. Most importantly, the gel needs to have the proper thickness to ensure Nuface Trinity's proper gliding or lifting motion. I have tried a bunch of gels. Below are my observations on gels:- Jason Aloe Vera gel: no unpleasant smell like Lily of Desert's, a tiny bit thicker than Lily of desert, but still too watery for Nuface. The downs: irritable to skin. When I use it on my hands which have eczema breakout occasionally, it really stings, and it is not as soothing as Lily of Desert.- Nuface Gel Primer: the ups: the right thickness for Nuface trinity. With the gel primer, the device glides smoothly on skin, but not too fast. The gel also provides enough resistance so that the device can lift and hold skin. The downs: It is expensive. it is a bit irritating when I use it, although there is no lasting effect once I wash it off. For the purpose of Nuface, I've not found a gel that works as well as the gel primer.- Zinc-kite c2 gel: Very pleasant smell, not irritable to skin at all. Though it is a tiny bit thicker than a typical aloe gel, it is still too thin (watery). It is difficult to control the gliding motion of Nuface, and impossible to perform lift/hold motion, as there is no resistance to lift any skin.- Lily of Desert Aloe Vera gel: unpleasant smell, watery, not suitable for Nuface at all. However, it is very soothing. When I have eczema breakout, I apply some on my skin, it ceases the itch right away. So I am glad to have found this product and now it is a must have."

166876,0,"I got this and put in on the night before because i find it gives the tanner enough time to develop. when i woke up in the morning, i definitely was darker, however, it was all in my pores and such. since i had just showered the night before, i really didn't want to have to take another shower that morning, however, it's really necessary because otherwise you just look really dirty."
27673,0,"I've used this product for 7 years as it has morphed through a few branding changes with name and packaging, however, the product had always remained the same. However, this time although the packaging is the same, the tint is lighter, not quite as dark in color. Moisturizing aspect seems the same, however, the lighter tint is a bit disappointing."
73411,1,I have used Charlie Blue for 35 years. I love it. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Thanks for your prompt service.
11078,2,"This product was good, while it worked. Unfortunately for me, its motor burned out in 3 weeks! Probably a good thing, being that it is defective, that the motor burned out right away and I could get my purchase price refunded without any hassle. I probably will not buy anything from this manufacturer again. Thanks, amazon, for processing my refund right away."
89651,0,I bought this perfume off a memory I had used it more than 25 years ago. The scent has changed and does not have that earthy almost sinful scent II remembered. Could the formula be changed. It's Pleasing enough but timid and has the scent of talcum central to its presentation. If you haven't smelled the original it's nice enough if you're familiar with it you might be disappointed. Service from the provider was flawless.
147527,0,"The item is described as a ""soft bonnet"" hair dryer. The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft. It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet. The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!"
40144,1,"This is totally awesome... I can't believe it. Back in Kazakhstan, we all use goats to cut our nail size. But after coming to USA, there are no goats, so I used to bite off my nail and it was very hard. This thing is the best invention ever. It was complicated to figure out how to use it.. but the design is awesome. I will take many back to Kazakhstan."

47670,0,"This is no doubt a quality product. My objection was to the added color and fragrence that was not present in my original purchase. The person that I purchased the product for was not pleased with this aspect, and did not wish to use it or to pay me for it. Had I known of the true nature of the item prior to purchasing it, I probably would not have done so."
177037,0,"La Mer is a great moisturizer and I felt that it improved the look and feel of my skin by reducing fine lines, evening skin tone and helping me to retain moisture throughout the day (and my skin is kinda dry) but I wouldn't classify this item as a miracle cream. I've read a lot of info on this product and it seems like any dermatologist that gets asked about it says the clients with the best skin always confess to using it. However, it's very expensive and I feel like I get close to the same results with a $10 jar of Eucerin Q10 Creme. I am only in my early thirties so maybe the differences between the two becomes more marked the older you are and the longer you use it. I used it for a few months and have been using the Eucerin product for years before and after that. I just occasionally try out high end products to see if they do anything better for my skin. So far, I have yet to find one that does (and I've used Murad, Strivectin, Kinerase, Perricone and many others). So, I don't really buy the whole, 'you get what you pay for' mentality. I think cosmetics might be a lot like wine - packaging, marketing and reputation/status are used to appeal to the customer rather than straight quality and the cost is mostly arbitrary."

194003,1,"I only applied this a couple hours ago and already I'm in love!! This is my first bottle of china glaze and I definitely picked a beautiful color to try. I've heard people say that with china glaze it takes 3 to 4 coats to get true to color, luckily with this color it only took 2.I used a revlon quick dry top coat and so far this is one of the best manicures I've ever had! I've had really bad luck with other polishes so if all china glazes look like this I'm sold!!"

55515,2,"I read somewhere that Sarah Jessica Parker says this stuff makes her face ""glow"", yeah, it made me look pasty. And it actually didn't settle into my skin evenly. Not happy with this product at all, but will still use it as sunscreen as it seems to do the job."
128049,1,"I have purchased this stuff at least 6 times; unheard of for me, who usually has a graveyard full of partially-used curl products. As a general rule, I don't use curl activators because I find them to make my hair too fuzzy. But this one is awesome. It took the place of my leave-in conditioner AND gel. I use one product and that's it. It can make my hair a little crunchy but I'll take that over frizzy any day. Once my hair is dry I shake it out and get rid of the crunch. It also adds some shine."
237125,0,"Well, I always read reviews people leave on something I am considering to buy..and I looked forward to this product..I have used it full strength and also diluted and have not found it tingling or nondrying..guess I have to do some more research on the best way to apply for shampoo and body soap..at this point would not purchase again."
40012,0,"I was really looking forward to trying these clippers after going through about 10 cheap clippers that required brute force to use.I have to admit that, after reading all the positive reviews, I'm fairly disappointed in these. Why? Well, first, they don't seem to be all that sharp. But that may be more perception than reality, because they do cut my nails well.But even more disappointing is that the opening is so narrow that I have to fumble around just to get my nails into the slot. I found a cheap pair of all-stainless steel clippers at the big-box superstore for about $3.00 that seem to do a better job."
167663,0,"Pros: It heats up quickly and has so many setting levels. It tames the frizz in my slightly wavy hair. The one con I have is that it is a bit hard to handle and bulky. I wish there was a smaller version of this iron, like a 1/2 to 1 inch wide plate."
19501,2,"Like a number of the other reviewers I had hoped that this product would be a miracle powder that would give great coverage but be invisible. I found that it gives a look that is nice from a distance, but looks extremely powdery close up and totally fails to cover my freckles and dark spots i.e. the sun damage on my skin. Like another reviewer, it also makes my skin itch.The most annoying thing I found is that, no matter how little I used, the powder seemed to 'migrate' down my face and end up on my mouth. I ended up constantly rubbing it in clumps off of my lips. Yuck. No other powder I have used has ever done this. This was $25 not well spent. If you are thinking of buying it, try someone else's first if you can."
195461,2,Nowhere is it mentioned that it's strength is 2 out of 5 !! too small in the picture !They don't accept return .disappointed.it does nothing to your hair.
48743,0,"Doesn't really refresh the skin, and kind of bites a bit sometimes, like an electrical shock. And if my hair's wet, I can feel little jolts going up into my scalp.. I haven't been using it consistently, so I can't say whether or not it visibly improves facial muscle tone."
45012,1,"Okay, is it a bit messy to put it on? Yes. Who cares! It gave me the most awesome natural looking tan I could ask for. I needed to be tan for my halloween costume party becuase I was showing a lot of skin. I got a ton of compliments! By the way, it took the whole can for one application, so plan accordingly. Two thumbs way up!!"
24370,0,"Like many toiletry bags; it has too large of a main compartment so that all your tiny containers of cream and potions are jumbled together and you have to dig dig dig. I know there are other pouch options within this bag, but I like to group my toiletries and the big section really only needs to be large enough for a travel hairdrier and small travel brush. If you're askin' I think the one in this bag should be divided into 2 sections. A double zipper on the main entry into the bag would have also been more helpful. It's very difficult to find a good toiletry bag. I had one last decade that was a similar layout to this and was perfect but it wore out. Alas!, this one is the closest I've yet to find. I'll keep it but I'll still keep an eye out."
223223,1,This has been my perfume for 2 years already! I love it! There's no other better perfume for me. THe only one that may compete with this one would be Cashmere by Donna Karen. It last long and the fragance is really sweet. And as it fades the smell becomes even better unlike other perfumes which smells like alcohol as it fades away
150503,0,"when i first turned it on the first thing i noticed was the smell, it smells like burning plastic!it is super hot, it gets hot instantly! i used the number system, and it was too hot for my hair, so i have YET to figure out the number for my hair.it didn't do a good job of flat ironing my hair yet, but i had some hair conditioner on it...so i'll wash it and come back and add another review."
173463,0,"This product really works on disentangle the hair, but as a conditioner is not good, my hair was completely frizzy using this as a conditioner as well, the smell is awful, it doesn't have a bad smell but the smell that it has to me is like a cheap perfume or a cheap fragance. It doesn't worth that much money because for a good detangler I could buy Paul Mitchells that is one of the best detanglers I ever used for much less money."
86403,1,"This is the best stuff on the market to stop fingernail biting or thumb sucking. I have been a fingernail biter for a long time. You won't do it more than a couple of times if you put this on your fingernails.The taste is bitter and long lasting. It's meant to stop you in your tracks and leave a lingering reminder to not be stupid and try and put your finger or thumb in your mouth again. It takes a while to get the taste out for good reason.I used this on my son to stop his finger sucking. Two coats work better than one and it lasts about 3-4 days with full ""flavor"". Reapply afterwards. It only takes a few weeks if you stick with it and the thumb sucking/fingernail biting goes away."
173710,1,"My hair had been falling out, looking dull and brittle. Since I started using this, my hair has grown back, and has come back healthier, fuller and grows and a very tiny bit goes a very long way."

224029,0,"I live in the NE and have fine hair. I bought this shampoo thinking that it would hydrate my hair during the winter without weighing it down. It certainly left me with lots of body, but my hair looks like I just used a clarifying shampoo. It's more dried out than when I use my regular shampoo (Fekai's Glossing Shampoo). I love the Carthame mask, so I'm quite surprised. Maybe it will be OK in the summer, when my roots get oily, but for the winter this will not work for me."
208383,0,"My mother used this on me for EVERYTHING and swore by it. It would work a sliver out of your finger overnight. The stuff was originally made for farmers to apply to the teets of cows. Recently I bought 4 jars and it is not the same stuff and missing something. I think it is the camphor and possibly another active ingredient but it definately does not work like the original and smells different too. I think this is an imitation from China. Good try, China but I wish I could find the authentic original ""Sayman"" salve cuz mine ran out and my kids loved it too. The real stuff would mend cuts, burns, hangnails, and work foreign objects from your skin with a blob of salve and a band-aid overnight. A great product if you can get the real stuff which I don't think they make anymore. Too bad. My mom must have sold hundreds of mom's that stuff through the years and I would promote it too if it was still available."

I even put the natural HENNA on my children's hair and they had the shiniest hair on the playground.I had strawberry blonde hair as a child and now it is brown and gray sprinkled in. I do not mind the gray at all but, natural red heads never gone all gray, why I do not know why.This is the only product I know of that allows me to be VERY CLOSE to my natural shade and cause no harm to my hair as it is not a chemical. It looks sooooooooo natural.I recommend this product on a scale of 1 to 10 a...................12For people who do not need color to cover gray can use the natural. The shine is FABULOUS."

69901,2,I've been using the product for a month and so far I haven't noticed a significant difference in the age spots on my face. I'm going to get a dermatologist opinion. I also may try the new Clinique or Garnier products on the market. I wouldn't recommend this product.
97712,2,"I have purchased this cologne couple weeks ago based on reviewes in amazon;make me totally upset. Even you spray more than an adequate amount, just disappearsafter 5-10 mins. Just a nice example of an expired cologne and I am just like anclassic example of ""effect of buying materials not before testing it""AMAZON should find out something to keep customers free from this issues."
32016,0,"Don't think about using this if you have very dry skin, as the retinol which eases those fine lines also causes skin to flake and peel, and Never use any product not especially designed for the orbital area around your eyes. I had undergone laser resurfacing about nine years ago on my face, but at the time my doctor said the forehead didn't need it. Now it doesn't have the same smooth feel as the rest of the skin on my face, so I decided to try the ROC Over-night Deep Wrinkle cream. Been using it for several weeks, and it has lessened the lines and made my skin feel smoother, but I've had to use some heavy-duty moisturizer during the day to counteract the drying effects of the product. I've now stopped using it and am using Kinerase, which smooths out those lines but also moisturizes as well. Don't expect it to work overnight, it has a cumulative effect, but at least while you're using it, it hydrates the skin better than anything I've found yet, and it was recommended to me by the surgeon who did the lasering on my face. As far as the ROC product, I would recommend it for short-term use only, and not for those with dry skin issues, as it will only aggravate them."
156698,1,"I bought this product because my mom has one and I just love it! So I decided to get one. I have searched everywhere online and the cheapest one I could find was this one (total price including shipping). So I give it five stars :)For those who are wondering what it looks like on the nail, it is NOT a solid color. It's an iridescent, slightly pearly coat with shades of fuchsia. If you wear it over any nailpolish, you will be fascinated with what it will do! Last time I wore it over an orange nail polish and it turned to iridescent hot pink! It is amazing! It was one of the most beautiful colors I have seen so I truly recommend this. I believe any kind of iridescent nail polish has this effect but I've only tried it with the Chine Glaze Rainbow. By the way, Chine Glaze has sooo many beautiful and unique nail polishes, I love it."
39381,1,"This is exactly what I was looking for to replace my old Conair hair dryer that finally died after over 10 years of use. My favorite feature of this dryer is that it has 3 air temperatures, including cool which I like to use when I'm not in a rush as it is less damaging to hair or when the weather is hot. The ionic feature works, to my surprise, as my family's hair looks & feels noticeably softer & somewhat shinier after blow-drying. I look forward to another many years of reliable performance from my Conair dryer."
90492,2,"One big mess! Impossible to put on without it flaking all over your face. Didn't like it at all. And the seller has a horrible return policy. 14 day return policy and NO returns on makeup. I can walk into an Ulta store, buy anything I want, including makeup, and return it if I'm not happy. No questions asked. I certainly learned a lesson about checking return policies BEFORE I buy anything."

202867,1,"First, I have to say that I love this scent. I used to wear Amber essential oil, but only found one type that I liked, that smelled like actual Amber resin. But when I moved in 1997, I could not find that brand of oil anywhere else, and everything I could find smelled weird or was synthetic. So, when I saw this advertised and saw that they used real amber, I took a shot and ordered this.And it is PERFECT! It is the correct scent of amber and I love that it is in a wax base, it is so easy to apply.There are just a couple minor reasons why I didn't give it the full 5 stars, just so you are aware. It was not anything big, but was enough to catch my attention.1. Since it is in a wax base, (which, for some people, is better for you that applying full strength essential oil to your skin like I used to do), it is not as strong of a scent as I got with the pure oil. But not bad.2. When I ordered it, it showed it in a carved stone container. When I received it, it was in a little wooden box. I see that they are now showing the correct picture, so maybe my sale caused them to update the site or something, but was just not what I was expecting. I worry that some of the essential oils in the wax can be lost by seeping into the wood, which might not have happened with the stone box, but will have to see.3. It is tiny. Seriously. I was expecting it to be about the diameter of a silver dollar or so. This is barely bigger than a quarter. The actual scent wax is smaller than a nickel. so, just be aware. While it might be a handy size to fit in a purse or in a travel kit, it is also small enough to get easily lost on a bathroom counter...so just be aware.I do have to admit, that I LOVE the fact that they use real amber and the smell is spot on. If you like the scent of real amber, not the faux commercial, overtly sweet chemical stuff, I would highly recommend it.(and yes, I am a guy - I just like wearing more natural scents that some of these weird colognes they have out nowadays.)"

40573,1,"My right hand was in a cast for three months after surgery last year. During that time, I had to attend a black tie event and couldn't apply my own make-up. I had a professional make-up artist do my make-up for me before the event. She used Amazing Concealer - and I was truly amazed when I looked in the mirror!! This stuff is wonderful! The bags under my eyes totally disappeared as did any red spots. It looked very natural, felt very light, and covered like a dream. I hate the feeling of heavy products on my face, but this concealer wasn't even noticable. I won't be without it!"
225993,2,"I bought this product for my son who sucks his thumb. I tested it on myself and him and it doesn't work! The bad taste that is supposed to keep you from biting your nails or sucking your thumb is barely there and completely goes away after a couple seconds. When I went to return this item because it doesn't work, I was told I couldn't return it since I opened it. How was I supposed to know that it was made so poorly? It's a product you would have to try to find out! Don't waste your money!!!"

28597,2,"I was excited to receive Hope in a Jar for Christmas but after a few uses developed a horrible, raised, itchy red rash all over my face and developed very sensitive dry skin. Thinking that perhaps daily use was too much at first I decided to try it again - the rash started developing about 8 hours later and got worse even after washing my face with a gentle cleanser. Took about 5 days before my skin was back to normal.I've never had this type of reaction to a product before and will stick to Philosophy scents as opposed to skin products."
46321,0,The travel soap was quite small and I had expected it to be somewhat larger. Also I had thought by the description that it was all natural but it has some additives which I didn't want. The fragrance and texture of the bar is nice and enjoyable.

160252,1,"i got snookered into buying this and the matching super secret super brightening power at a neimans one day when i was weak and tired. the powder is awesome, but very messy, by the way (moderately super). this brightener is interesting, it has a halo effect, and is at its most effective when coupled with the matching powder. but it does not do any covering up; no concealing of any kind here. i used up my pen in an astonishingly short period of time, which sort of irritated me, but i learned how to use brighteners i the course of owning it, which was a new technique to me. if you need color under your eyes in addition to brightening (which i sometimes do), you can easily replace this product with benefit's ooh la la lift."

67873,0,"I like the concept behind Aveda, but I'm not sure their products work for me. I'm not a big product user, but I thought mousse should be in my hair care arsenal, the price seems good, and I like the ingredient list. However, it leaves my hair kind of dull-looking and sticky, and doesn't add much volume. I realize this could have a lot to do with me not buying the texturing and finishing products and not having the same styling equipment that they used on me in the salon (or maybe I just don't have that magic touch), but I don't have the money or time or patience to go through so many steps in the morning. I want soft, clean-feeling hair more than I care about volume or style, and this mousse isn't doing it for me. So I'm giving 3 stars for an okay product that doesn't add much to my 'do', and I think I'll look elsewhere when I run out."

The line will re-develop by afternoon, but doesn't seem to be as severe as it was before. I've been using the Frownies for about 2 weeks. I find them to be comfortable and easy to use. Bonus is that if you rip the thing off in the morning (instead of using water) it saves you from having to tweeze between your eyes!"

249412,2,"Hi, I tried this because my eyelashes and eyebrows have become thin over the years. I put this on, yes it's blue, at night. All it did was irritate my eyes and did not make any hair grow.

203658,1,"I tried the Wen Cleansing Conditioners a few months ago and couldn't be happier with the results. The results were instant and my hair has gotten even better over time. The Cleansing Conditioner has transformed my dry damaged hair into healthy, shiny and bouncy locks!! I am 49 years old and have been coloring my hair since my 20's. As I begin to aproach the big 50 my hair had become very dry and unmanageable but since using Wen my hair now feels like it did when I was in my 20's, healthy! I have read many reviews where people say Wen has left their hair limp and flat...I believe that these people are NOT using the product correctly. The more you use, the better the results. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is the only product that I have found that delivers what it promises! Make sure you read and follow the directions to a T and I promise you won't be sorry!! AND, by the way, I have found the prices for the Wen products are better on QVC than here on Amazon."
103005,0,"I read a lot of good reviews on this product so I brought it to try it out. When I opened the container, first thing I noticed about it is the smell. I don't like it. It reminds me of when I was synthesizing acetaminophen in lab; one of the chemicals used smelled exactly like this creme - synthetic banana. I guess if you like the scent it is fine. The creme is really soft and nice though but I wouldn't buy it again cause I really don't like the scent at all."

227437,2,I was so looking forward to receiving my all time favorite fragrance and this is NOT the same formula. I want to cry as they somehow changed the notes and it doesn't have the same smell; for me it is actually a little nauseating but then perhaps it is only that I want to be sick because of my disappointment. I will be looking for a new fragrance and am so ticked at Cacharel for switching things up. It smells kind of cheap.
248654,1,"I started to purchase this by chance, I always wore Anne Klein, then it was dicontined and costly if I did find it. I LOVE this scent, I went by the description of ingredients and took a chance. The size of this bottle blew me away, For under 30.00 dollars delivered and something I adore and don't have to hunt down, WOW! I love Amazon and it's products. Thank you for a deal that makes me happy. Fantastic!"
57896,0,"I've used Egyptian Musk oil off and on for over 10 years now, ever since I discovered it in high school. This particular brand smells a little bit different than the others I've used but it does smell good, no doubt. However, I think this oil is overpriced. It is thinner than the other brands I've used and when I received mine, it had no roller so some had leaked out into the packaging. Very disappointing. Luckily, I had an old bottle with a roller that I was able to pour the oil into. I have also ordered the Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess oil so I'm going to see if I like that better/it's better bang for you buck."
227568,1,This is the best skin lotion I have ever used. I have purchased several bottles and my mom used it when she was at my house so I had to order her a bottle too. Great price and love Amazon!
236555,0,"I purchased this foundation with high hopes because I can NEVER find a foundation to match my skin perfectly. With my acne scars and redness it's hard to match a foundation so I got this to do the matching for me. However, it didn't seem to adjust color at all. I tried it first on my wrist, then on my face and both colors were exactly the same and did not match my face at all. I think because it comes out white it just gives you the illusion of 'color adjusting' but really, you're picking your color when you pick light, light/medium, or dark. Even if the color had been perfect, coverage wasn't enough and it didn't seem to set on my face even with a finishing powder. Won't repurchase."
74745,0,"The product is good although bit pricy but good. Found it to be better than the alternatives but still pricy, recommended. Would be a hit if had a more competitive price."

43938,1,"The clippers came with everything as described. I've had it for a couple of days, but I'm still a little nervous at cutting my own hair. I did give myself a quick line up, but that's as far as I'm confident to go as for now. The clippers are quiet, there really no louder than the clippers at the local barbershop if they are loud when you get them then you just need to adjust the power. They are a little bigger than i would like but i guess that's because of the motor (which has quite a lot of power). The only problem i have is the 1/16"" fuzz cut comb, it doesn't snuggly fit on the clippers as well as i would like."

169867,2,"I'm a facial product junkie, and when I came across this pore cleanser, I was elated. However, once I received it, I believe I only used it a few times. I was discouraged by the lack of any visual results, and I gave up on the product. I also read that products that use a suction action can actually HARM the skin due to the constant pulling of the skin. So, it may actually CAUSE wrinkles in the long run! So, stick to professional facials if you can afford them (b/c they're worth it!), or use clay/mud masks and Biore strips."
116411,1,I use this make-up when working outdoors. It's stays on when you sweat and has good sunblockage. Sorry it has been discontinued.
248852,2,"Sure the product made my hair ""smooth"", but it wasn't super silky smooth. The product has a wierd smell, not too happy when I have it on my hair. This doesn't help with frizzy hair, even if you used it with the CHI ceramic flat iron.I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you want to spend $19 with a $6 order to have free shipping!"
209095,1,"Dermalogica's clay cleanser is very effective for oily skin and the larger size lasts for a long time, making it a great value. I like to combine it with a scrub now and then for extra cleaning, but having tried many other products on the market I find this is the best."

106678,0,"When I first smelled a sample of this, my first thought was ""HAVE TO HAVE IT"". I rushed out and bought this a couple of days later. First of all, the scent goes away like in 1 hour or less. I just got sick of it and out of my entire fragrance collection this is at the bottom of my list. The scent is also TOO fruity, like cheap body spray. I once smelled it on someone else and thought it was way too overpowering. It is a bad version of Cool Waters (Davidoff)."
210697,1,"A great, soft fragrance that makes me go OOOOOO! when I smell it. A favorite for both me and my husband."
86567,2,Bought this for our 3 year old. He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started. We've tried is on several different occasions now over the course of a year and he still bites.
85240,2,"On the plus side, this is a nice mug and an ok brush. On the negative side, this is the worst shaving soap I've ever used. It's a shame, too, because the mug is so narrow (to fit the Porter's soap) that it will not fit any other soap.I've tried several brands of shaving soap, including Taylor of Old Bond Street, the generic pharmacy brand, Proraso and Colonel Konk. They all perform better than Porter's - even the inexpensive generic from the corner store.Regardless of how hot or lukewarm the water is, or how much you use, or how hard or soft the water is, or how much time you spend lathering, this soap just does not lather. It remains weak and thin in any case. It's also too small to fit in a normal shaving dish or mug - it will only fit the Porter's mug. Save your money and your skin, use Taylor of Old Bond Street."
230283,0,This shampoo definitely cleans your head but I needed something medicated for a reason and it hasnt helped with what I needed it for.

140342,0,"paul sebastian is a good value if your looking for a lower priced fragrance that has some kick to it..a bit of an alcohol smell when you first put it on, but, it settles in and is actually a decent smell and a great value for the money..not as nice as the higher end products but you get what you pay for...nice to keep around for everyday casual wear but if your looking for something more unique and classy, try lalique or the other higher end products...this is a good value, however, and i am satisfied with it for what i paid"

147540,2,"This thing doesn't actually deserve ANY stars, but that's not an option here, so it gets the requisite one star.Don't waste your money. Within fifteen minutes (I kid you not - I timed it, prompted by the negative reviews I saw on this site) of starting this thing up, the stoopid thing overheated and shut itself off. This thing spent more time off than on. With the quantity of hair that I have, I normally spend easily an hour and a half to two hours under any dryer in order to completely dry my hair.I'm going to buy another Lady Dazey dryer as soon as I can get my hands on one - I've had one of those for over a decade, and only recently has it started acting up!Do yourself a favor: find a Helen of Troy brand Lady Dazey soft bonnet dryer - those things are more dependable than anything else out there, and worth EVERY penny!"
236685,0,"This product works ok. It cushions the metatarsal area well, but the problem with it is it flaps around a lot and doesn't stay straight. It needs a band that goes around the foot to hold it in place better. It made me feel like I had socks bunched up in my shoe, so wearing it wasn't very comfortable. But, it was better than nothing."
170905,0,"Product was shipped and received in a good amount of time. When I put this polish on, it didn't look like an actual mint color. It was more bluish but it's still alright. After 2 days, it started to chip pretty badly with a protective overcoat on top, so I had to remove it all."
181743,0,I purchased China Glaze Pool Party & Yellow Polka Dot BikiniThe Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon yellow.I noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color going.The colors are so pretty but you just need so many coats.I used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.I really like China Glaze but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle but like I have said just need too many coats.The polishes also chipped within a day as well.
54149,0,"I needed a replacement for my old set, unfortunately this set also came with the Super size which I did not really need.

Thus the rating.Not sure I would buy again due to those factors."

23007,1,"I started using Aveeno products about two months ago and have noticed a significant improvement in my skin texture: much smoother and less redness. This scrub is very gentle - no harsh grains to cause abrasions or redness; just smooth, small microbeads that softly exfoliate your skin. I use this in conjunction with the Positively Radiant Cleanser and have been extremely happy. I have very oily and sensitive skin - believe me, I've tried just about every product out there and this is the best I've found."
112325,2,"While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I'm out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because ""It's never been that way so I don't know how that could be possible."" Way to make your customer feel great. I'll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must."

110147,1,"This roll-on perfume oil has a vanilla base scent, a cherry top note, and a hint of spice that emerges as it warms(with my body chemistry, anyway. As with any perfume, it will smell a bit different on each individual). This has been my signature scent for the last ten years. When I wear it, people constanly ask, ""What is that fabulous smell?"" (That or, ""Is someone baking?"" If someone mistaking you for baked goods is a problem, this is not the perfume for you.)I have sensitive skin, and many perfumes make me sneeze, but this product is gentle on allergies and my skin. The scent is young and playful, not for days when I'm feeling grown-up and serious (on those day I wear this company's Sandalwood Vanilla). The only drawback: sometimes too much oil comes out on the roller. Apply sparingly or this scent will be cloyingly sweet."

I loved the smell of the shampoo, but I found that after a day or so, you really needed to use a conditioner with it because it doesn't leave hair very soft.

After a momentary greasiness, it absorbed completely and continued to leave my skin soft after washing twice with soap.Unfortunately, the scent also lingered. The top notes are vaguely citrus-like, but once they have faded, the lingering scent is, I'm not sure what, a bit floral perhaps? Whatever it is, it's not lemon. It's not even citrus. I found the scent odd and off-putting and the butter ended up in the garbage.Five stars for moisturizing. No stars for the scent."

218125,2,"The perfume I purchased on Amazon does not smell like the original one I have had in the past (that I bought in a department store. The bottle and color are the same, but the scent is not. I will not purchase this perfume again, unless I can smell it first."
110610,1,"Yes, it's true, I have very sensitive armpits. I can't use products like Right Guard or Old Spice or any type of deodorant or anti-perspirant like this. If I do, a wicked rash results. Thankfully, Tom's of Maine makes this fine unscented roll-on that doesn't harm my tender pits. It does actually have a light, citrus-like smell to it, but only when you first apply the product to your underarms. I don't notice the smell after I begin my day.In fact, I work out on an elliptical machine everyday and do weights at least four days a week and I have yet to notice any severe perspiration or odor. There's no real smell at all. My armpits stay nice and dry and I no longer suffer from rashes.This is a very good product to have in your odor-fighting arsenal. Tom's of Maine makes many other healthcare products and I know for a fact that many work well.Highly recommended, especially if you're a sensitive yet studly gentleman like myself."
205594,1,"This is my favorite scent, I have a hard time finding something that goes with me, I have used this perfume for years and hope it never goes off the market.I received my product faster than estimated which was wonderful since I was all out! Great company to order from. Very happy customer."
229922,1,"Love this mascara. I've used all kinds from Dior to Maybelline, and everything in between. This is great, deep black not almost black or brown-black. Thickens and lenghtens my lashes, but most importantly for me, stays on my lashes. My days are very long and even when I return home 14+ hours from when I put the mascara on I don't have flakes of mascara or dark circles under my eyes. No smear, no mess."
132933,0,"This exfoliant is designed to wake up your skin, scrubbing it with tiny abrasive ingredients to get rid of the old and bring forth the new. It exposes a newer layer of cells, removing dirt and older skin cells. One's face feels fresher and looks healthier. Burt's Bees does this and more, and it's the more that I don't like.In its admirable stance of using natural ingredients, the product contains sweet almond oil and almonds, vegetable glycerine, oats, orange peel and oil, rose powder, pecan powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, tocopherol (vitamin E), and fragrance. It's the nutmeg and clover that I don't like. The scent is so strong that it feels like you've smeared pumpkin pie on your face. The scent lingers, even after several rinses. It's glorious if you love this smell, but it's very annoying if you don't. Although it's called ""citrus,"" the overloaded spice smell completely dominates; I didn't smell citrus at all.The other problem is a noticeable oily texture. The oily feeling does rinse away, but aesthetically it's a letdown, antithetical to the fresh, cleansing feeling one expects. The product has a not uncomfortable ""grit"" to it, so it's up to the exfoliating task. Still, I'd easily recommend similar products by Origins and Alba over this Thanksgiving potpourri."
82884,0,"I ordered this size of shea butter by mistake- so be warned- this is designed to keep in your handbag or pocket. It's not much bigger than a silver dollar. Aside from that though, this is a lovely product with plenty of uses- lip balm, moisuriser, hair gel and so on. Great as a multi purpose handbag cosmetic. Works best when slightly warm."
215607,0,The smell is amazinly beautiful but after about two hours or so the smell is gone. I think for the price is not worth to buy. Maybe if the price would go down it's worth it. Too expensive to only last on you for a few hours.
218477,0,"I decided to try the waterproof Great Lash mascara because I liked how the original Great Lash looked, but it smudged all the time. This mascara goes on smoothly, doesn't clump, thickens somewhat (without spider-eyes), doesn't flake everywhere, and lasts all day. My only problem is even the waterproof version leaves undereye smudges after about two hours of wear. I have very fair skin, so maybe this will not be as noticeable on other users as it is on me. Unfortunately, I have to find something else."
207356,0,It looked good but would be nice in leather with padding.Gave this to a traveling coach who must wear ties most of the time.I thought it was a great gift! I filled it with pals of cough drops for him because those are a must at games as well!

Yes, it may seem expensive compared to some other products, but you REALLY don't need to use a huge amount of this for it to work. I used half a pea sized amount which covered all 10 fingers with a little extra. Love it!"

It's hard to find a natural but smooth sunscreen. I've been through so many its disgusting. Sadly this is a very expensive sunscreen to have issues like these. Supposedly the same suncreen with SPF 40, for the face is much better (no vitamin A)."
8307,2,"I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate. The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.Neither attachments really work. The threading of both seems to be flawed. And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered. This purchase was an expensive mistake."

61900,2,"I did the big chop with My hair (African American) and this product dried My hair out. I am also trying to gain growth around My temples and this stuff took My hair out in that area even more. Now I am really hating the big chop.This may work well for some but its the opposite for Me. I have a big jar and have to throw it out or find someone to give it to. I am so pissed right now. Now I have to start all over again trying to grow My edges out again. Now I am contemplating a wig but hoping that tomorrow when I wet My hair and gel it up it won't look bad (doubt it). Really upset now.All this damn hard work I am putting into growing out My hair correctly, and treating it with this stuff made all that effort pointless. Back to the drawing board.Not happy,"

233856,0,"I just bought this last week from this link. I love the Conair Infiniti line of products. The dryers are quiet and work well. The curling irons are great and so are the flat irons. I even love the brushes. Conair has the technology down. When I saw them offered in limited edition with the Swarovski crystals my heart jupmed because I love Swarovski and I thought it looked really good. The prices here is good also, considering the orignal retail prices was over $100. When it arrived it had everything but the nice wooden box pictured here. No where in the comments does it say it came without the box. I am still keeping it because everything seemed new and works well, but if you are buying it as a gift - BEWARE - there is no beautiful box that is pictured here. It comes straight out of the packing box. It does include the certificate of authenticity and the numbered tag."
175247,2,"I was so excited about this product, I had read good reviews of it, and had read the studies about niacinamide and how it is a great topical anti-inflamitory making it great for rosacea. Well, it made my face redder and covered with tiny red dots. I then went to the rosacea sufferer's forum and read how for some rosaceans niacinamide works and the others it makes their rosacea worse, so I guess I fall into that last category :( I was so disappointed and saddened, I really thought from all I had read that I had finally found that magic potion for my rosacea, well, back to the drawing board. I do not blame the product, I think if you do not react to it it will work for you and this has a good amount in it with nothing you don't want, but just know that niacinamide is not for everyone and you never know if you might be one of the unlucky ones...."

121809,0,"I have mild acne and last autumn I also developed what I think may be rosacea. My skin has been dull, redness prone, and flushing for a long time. I read about this moisturizer at Dr. Cynthia Baileys website during a time when my flushing and redness was particulary bad, and she recommended it for rosacea skin. Later I found it on Amazon and I decided to purchase it. The first time I put this cream on I was amazed at how vibrant my skin looked. It made my skin glow like never before. Unfortunately it made my skin very oily (especially around my nose) and after a couple of days I started to get some pimples on my cheek (I usually don`t get so many pimples on that area and because of that I suspect it may have been the cream) This is why I only give it a 3-star review. If you`re on the oilier side it may be a bit too greasy and if you`re acne prone it may possibly not be the best choise. If you don`t struggle with oily and blemish prone skin, but have a dull, lifeless complexion or rosacea (without a co-existing acne condition) you should definitely give it a try!"
184637,0,"...I can't help but to be reminded of my grandmother. Maybe it's because she uses a different Givenchy perfume and they just have similar scents, but it definately has that &quot;old lady&quot; smell (in a good way!). If you're young and sexy enough to pull it off, go for it, but if you're getting on up there I would suggest something else."
28176,0,I BOUGHT THIS CONDITIONER FROM NEUTROGENA THINKING IT WOULD BE HEALTHIER.

I DONT THINK ITS HEALTHIER AT ALL SO I'LL STICK WITH AVON AND AUSSIE.

193962,0,"Pretty color but the nail polish is kinda generic. You have to do a couple coats. Its very difficult to make it look streak free and smooth. It chips easy and you definately need a top coat. Also, the color is more of an orangeish pink. Its still pretty but not the color in the picture."
78599,1,"When I first got it, I was not impressed with it much. However, it grew on me extremely quickly. It is more refined smelling than the regular Cool Water. It is definitely a more mature smelling aquatic fragrance. A teenager or an older person could wear this and it would smell great on them, it's extremely versatile. It develops nicely on the skin and has good longevity. It is perfect for a summer fragrance!"

232461,0,"I needed a small roller set to take when I travel. These heat up quickly and make great curls, my only complaint are the pins that hold them on. It take a bit of working with each one so they stay on. I'll give this product a thumbs up for travel, but wouldn't use them everyday. I have a set with clips that cover each roller and those work much better."
155569,0,"Well-done. The only reason I give it a medium rating is because it is Christian-based, which for me is not necessary for learning boundaries. Could be helpful for someone else, though. I give it a very strong, solid three stars. Hope that helps."
43158,0,"This is my second bottle of 100% Pure Shower Gel I've bought. In the past I've used Bath & Body Works Shower Gel, Dove and others. Bath & Body Works & Dove Shower Gels are the only ones that don't make my skin itch after a few weeks of use, this shower gel also passed the test.The thing about this shower gel is that is not so much shower gel as shower liquid, but once you get used to that it is okay. This particular flavor of Strawberry Lemonade I would not recommend, you can't smell the strawberry at all and the lemonade is a little pungent/acrid for my taste. Hence the 3 star rating. I would recommend other flavors/scent instead."
159344,2,"I purchased this scalp liquid because I bought Psoriasin Ointment and that worked like a charm on the areas I could easily access. I thought that this would more easily handle my scalp above the hair line. However, I found that this product only helped to temporarily reduce itching and did relatively nothing to reduce the other symptoms. The point is that although Psoriasin makes both products, their healing qualities differ greatly."
194624,1,"Love it, I was a little hesitant when I received it and saw the actual color in the bottle, it was slightly different than what I expected, but the second I put it on it instantly became one of my favorite polishes."
26031,2,"Seeing how there are almost 100 reviews with a 4.5/5 rating, I thought I'd give this product a try despite the price. Unfortunately, it didn't work too well for me. My hair is a little under than an inch long and while it did hold my hair style in place, it failed to clump all the hair strands into bigger pieces of spikes. I guess you really must have hair shorter than 0.5"" to use this product. I've used this product with and without watered hair. It doesn't make your hair shine either.If any of you guys are looking to seriously spike your hair (regardless of hair length), stick with Got2B Ultra Glued. Has more shine and actually holds your hair in place."
166380,0,"I really like this lip gloss. It doesn't stay for 10 hours, but a quick reapply of the gloss freshens it up nicely. The colors are very flattering - even the nude has a nice punch of color that brightens the face.However, the tubes themselves are terrible - they leak and get stuck closed. I went through three of them before I had to change my gloss. I really wanted it to work out because I like the actual gloss so much, but it got all over everything in my bag and half the time it wouldn't open to let me use it.I've gone to their color stay gloss and so far so good."

The second time I used it I followed the directed exactally and my hair still looks really greasy.

249296,2,This was the wrong choice for me. Great gray coverage but it is darker than expected and made my hair turn brassy. The color is unnatural and I can't wait for it to fade away. Maybe I should have mixed a little bit of this one with a natural ash blonde? as one reviewer suggests..
210698,2,I bought this cologne and i feel just water in it with little smell. I might got a fake one. I just felt bad cause i had that cologne before and it was great.
119740,2,"Now, I really don't think I have a huge face...but I think Conair might. The result of using this facial sauna was my face being un-evenly steamed - well on my nose, between my eyes, and on my cheeks (closest to my nose), but crap everywhere else. Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face. No fun when you are trying to relax. And while you are tilting, the pores are closing on the parts of your face that are turned away from the steam. Pretty useless.I also tried Revlon's Facial Sauna, and found the same thing. Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!Thanks!"
41497,0,"I'm always looking for new ways of straightening my hair and was excited when this product first came out. I bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy way to straighten my hair, but was a little disappointed. It does straighten hair, but isn't as quick as the advertisements would have you believe. You do have to use the dryer by itself first to dry your hair, then you use the attachment to straighten (the promo I saw made it look like just one step). I also found it to be very cumbersome and awkward to use."

9267,2,"I thought I was getting a great deal when I paid $45 for these at a retail store. I've been looking at Remington and Conair rollers for a while, and this model, as well as a similar model, seemed perfect for me. I have long hair, to my waist, and finding rollers to curl it, and have the curls stay in place, is a daunting task. So I was looking for a variety of rollers just like these.The heat up time was quick. I grabbed the first roller-which you pick up by the clasp which holds it in place-and my fingers began to burn...A LOT! There is absolutely no way to hold the clasp, or the roller, without seriously burning your hands and fingers. With other hot rollers, you can hold them by the ends or middle, but that isn't an option with this model. I believe I lost my fingerprints today. I've never had a problem enduring painful or uncomfortable procedures in the name of beauty, but this was ridiculous. I managed to use all of the rollers, however, they failed to stay in place, so they dangled, burning my ears and the side of my face as well.The cooling time was fast, and I had very little trouble removing them without tangles. The curls were a nice size, but even using the smaller rollers, in small pieces, they didn't curl the bottom of my hair. In spite of using a strong hairspray, the curls didn't hold up. These might work for someone who is trying to tame unruly curls, but for someone with straight hair, find an alternative. Also, if you don't enjoy 2nd degree burns, find another brand. My hands, fingers, ears and face are raw, especially the palms of my hands and the tips of my fingers. Rather than investing their money in an attractive presentation, Remington should concentrate more on the practical application."
99679,0,"I can't speak to recovery, but I do agree that I slept better and longer while taking ZMA. With that said I also believe it caused me to break out. I'd gone almost a year without any kind of break out, started taking this, a week later I had four spots of new acne. Correlation? Yes. Causation? No...but still suspicious."

164451,1,"Love this fragrance since 1994, bought it on a trip to Europe and had difficulty finding it in the States. Thank you, Amazon."
191797,0,"This cologne isnt very musky like men's aftershave type fragrances but rather is very sweet and feminine(could easily be a women's perfume). I think its VERY strong and smells best lingering on your clothes than full force and freshly sprayed(in which its annoying like old church lady perfume). Women tend to like this smell but not in the way men want women to like it(older women like it alot). Like I said, lingering on the clothes it smells a bit different(more youthfully masculine and fun)...I personally use this cologne on weekends when I only plan on going to a few stores or working out. I dont regret buying it...it was fairly inexpensive and they give you ALOT. I recommend this for older men who want to smell youthful while attracting older women OR to teen boys who enjoy smelling more sweet like roses than musky like men's aftershave. It seems weird to smell this on all other age groups(including myself...im 25 and I feel weird as the smell doesnt match my style but oh well, weird is ok sometimes)."
85872,2,"I read some reviews that made me hope this would be the cure for my 5 year old daughter from sucking her fingers. I personally think this stuff tastes nasty, but my daughter will still suck her fingers, even with this stuff on. Doesn't seem to phase her. We had also tried ""Thumb"" which also didn't work. Mavala seems very similar to Thumb. We probably should have started trying this stuff when she was younger. Thumb worked for two of my other kids when they were two year olds to wean them from their binkies. It may help you, but didn't work for us :("
223619,2,"Back years ago this scent was somewhat ok, I remember having a small bottle of it someone gave me.I thought I would enjoy it again so asked for it as a gift.I was wrong.It was heavy and gave me somewhat of a headache.It's to old lady like.And very musky.I wouldn't recommend this scent.I sold it on ebay.I have noticed yellow or golden colors of perfume are too strong and musky."
20157,2,"This product may work for someone with very smooth skin, but for me it was blotchy and cakey. Couldn't wait to wash it off, I mean scrub! Undoubtedly with some expertise, the product could go on more evenly, just not my luck."
241332,0,"I don't have a ton of experience with salt scrubs, but this product is pretty much what I'd expect of one. I have dry skin, so I use this product occasionally in the shower on my arms and legs, hoping that the oils will rehydrate me a bit and that the salt will scrub off some of the dead skin cells. I would say it's pretty mediocre for the rehydration (perhaps the ingredients are just not appropriate for that), and it's pretty much as good as you can expect for the scrubbing (it's hard to go wrong there, with sea salt as the #1 ingredient). I also occasionally use this product when giving myself a manicure or pedicure, and I'm terrifically happy with the results when doing that. My hands/feet get really nice and smooth as a result.My biggest gripe with the product is the smell: It has a pretty strong citrus smell, and the scent just doesn't work for me. For this aspect alone, I'll be trying another product next time."
171872,2,"This product guarantees that it will turn dark hair blonde. I had Auburn hair underneath due to a very bad salon experience. The directions say leave on a minimun of 20 minutes and a maximun of 90. I left it on for 80 minutes and it turned my hair bright orange. It says that if it doesn't work to your liking the first time to use again but after having it on for so long, I ended up with a chemical rash and had to go to a dermatoligists. So doing again is not an option. I do not recommend unless you have light brown to dark blonde hair, then it may work for you.."

1838,0,"I got this item because it was recommended by Cosmopolitan magazine for women with my skin type -- a light to dark brown complexion, e.g. Middle Eastern, Indian, or Southeast Asian. Women with this skin tend to suffer from hyperpigmentation or melasma which results in age/liver spots or dark patches of skin on their face and arms. It can be be worsened by exposure to sun. Women with this skin also tend to get dark spots resembling bruises that take awhile to go away whereever they get bug bites or other skin injuries.Hydroquinone can be used to lighten these patches and the DDF Fade Gel 4 has hydroquinone in the strongest concentration possible. I had previously used another drugstore product which came as a white cream, had the same concentration of hydroquinone, but was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it resulted in a slight sunburned look in every spot that I applied it, which is one of the possible side effects. (I looked ridiculous, with red patches around my eyes, nose, and mouth.) To avoid this side effect, you ought to (and the package says so) avoid direct sunlight as much as possible after application and during use of the product.With the DDF Fade Gel 4, I was happy that I suffered from no adverse side effects: no burning sensations; no sunburned skin; and it actually was effective in lighting the dark skin pigmentation around my eyes, mouth, nose, and the dark spots left behind wherever I got mosquito bites on my legs and arms. It definitely worked, but don't expect miracles.My biggest complaint about the product however, was that the gel was a dark caramel color. The result was that when you applied it to your skin, it actually made the area of application darker for the period that it is on your face. And if you're not careful about using only the smallest amounts, you'll end up with the product dried and caked onto the application areas, which will flake off if you rub at it (and since it's a caramel color, it's definitely noticeable).Moreover, it's a very expensive product and you get a very small jar. I think that I'll just experiment with some of the cheaper products in the future that also contain 2% hydroquinone."

Big mistake. My skin became so irritated afterwards that it caused an acne flare up. Purity has some irritating ingredients in it, such as black pepper (of all things...). Therefore most of the time I don't use this thing at all.However, I have found that it works well for removing makeup. I don't know about the long-lasting types of makeup, but at least it works well for removing powder makeup. So that's a plus...In short, if you're thinking about buying this, start with the smallest bottle you can find."
37119,0,"The pros - heats up really fast; leaves tight, cute curlsThe cons - terrible design in every way. First, the tip is way too hot to hold, so I've had to use both hands on the handle to curl. Second, I pushed the on/off and heat control buttons while using this curling iron, no matter how hard I tried not to. They're just completely in the way.All in all, I'm keeping the iron because I think it's as good as it's going to get for the price... I can just deal with the cons."
85424,0,"I would recommend this product to my friends, because it's very non-irratating and not very greasy. It didn't work as well as I had hoped though, therefore I'm only giving it three stars. I think they could have made it better."
146076,0,"I had high hopes for this product after reading other reviews...but so far I'm not really impressed. My hair feels a little better than before, but not enough to justify the cost. I have only used it a few times, and I hope it will get better with time....but so far...I'd say it's not worth it."
213083,1,"This brush has very stiff bristles, and it's very good for exfoliating skin. If you're looking for a gentle brush, this is not the one for you. The only thing I don't like about it is that the handle very easily separates from the head since it's not glued together, the handles just fits into a slot."
128732,0,"I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews. But I realized the basic consumer theory ""you will always get what you pay for"" It's not a bad cologne. Smells good, but cheap."
37033,0,"Very disappointed. The item I received was not the ""Nano"" blue curling iron. It was the plain Infinity black that I already have. They did not send me the correct item that was ordered. So basically the seller did a bait and switch from the item advertised. The Nano is a newer version."
139498,0,"I LOVE this waver, but unfortunately I only got to use it a few time (3) before it no longer would get hot. I was so sad. It worked so well on my long, Straight, straight, sleek, thin hair. I plugged it in and the light came on and it got hot. I was able to do about three sections of hair before I realized it was no longer hot enough and then it went cold. I tried other sockets, but it didn't help. I read other reviews about this happening,but figured I would give it a try. I do like it enough to purchase it one more time and hopefully it will last longer =)UPDATE: Well, it's been a year since I've purchased my 2nd deep waver and it is still working. The only problem I have with it is that it makes my hair have a burning smell after using it. I even use it on a very low setting. It may just be my hair, but curling irons don't leave my hair with that smell."
120356,1,Love this product! Shipment was received promptly. Would buy from this seller again! Youngblood is a a great foundation. Blends so well with your skin tone. Looks natural and lasts all day!
185875,2,"Olay is made by Proctor and Gamble, a company that still tests on animals even when it is NOT required by law. They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON'T test on animals?This cruelty is not worth vanity. I'll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don't test on animals!"
14558,1,"This is the only color Lipstick I wear, very hard to find. I will keep looking and keep buying it."
235509,2,"I wanted a change without dying my hair, I just wanted high shine. I followed the directions, my hair is dark brown, and now it's a reddish brown. Ugh! This is not what I wanted and I am really, really upset. If you want shine without the extra garbage like red, or blond highlights do not get this!! What a disappointment!"
88782,0,I thought the color would of been more matte vs. shiny as was the one at the salon when I first saw the color. Wondering why there would be a difference if its the same company.
136052,2,"I had pretty high hopes for this scent, as I'd had Demeter fragrances in the past and they were consistently good. Unfortunately, Tomato Seeds Cologne isn't as authentic as I hoped. Too alcohol-y and astringent, with little or no tomato scent. I'm guessing it's just a difficult smell to translate to a perfume, and not a lack of quality from Demeter.I might just stick to their florals."
50178,0,I like the large size of the mirror. My only concern is that the handle seems very flimsy and could break very easily.
19186,1,"I am 43 years old and I used to use a department store brand of makeup (parodied on Mad TV as Vancome) for many years before trying Bare Escentuals. I now use nothing but B.E. makeup and I use just about all of its various products. I used to have rosacea prone skin with mild acne & chicken pox (!) scars all over my face. I tried the foundation and the Mineral Veil and lo and behold, my skin cleared up and became lovely! The only time I break out now is when I don't wear my makeup.Once I quit trying to over-think the application of the different minerals (from foundations to eye shadows and liners) and simply 'Swirled, Tapped and Buffed', applying the stuff became second nature.I convinced my 16 year old daughter to try it and she is a sworn devotee as her formerly acne-crazed skin cleared up almost immediately. My youngest sister with the world's most sensitive skin has also become a sworn convert. We are both huge fans of the Rare Minerals Night Treatment; to our delight, it actually shrinks large pores, as well as a multitude of other benefits.I live in the desert (Tucson, AZ) and makeup that can withstand the elements, sweating, humidity from the approaching monsoons and other horrors thrown at us in the summer is a must...and Bare Escentuals fits the bill. There is no 'mask sliding down your face' sensation, and the Mineral Veil is fantastic at absorbing excess oils and touching up during the day.I cannot say enough good things about this entire line of cosmetics, including their 'Eye Revver-Upper' moisturizer because this stuff all lives up to the claims they make. The people at the company will even return your calls if you need any help at all.Amazing Products and Astounding Customer Service. It is the company that all the others are now trying to imitate with their own 'mineral based' cosmetics!I'll quit raving now, just try it and you'll be happy!"
195207,2,"HORRIBLE!!!!!! It is not the real thing. I am shocked that they can sell this on Amazon. I am honestly reconsidering ordering anything from here. It looked legit, but once my husband opened the bootleg product he realized that the word CODE was stickers that came right off. It doesn't even smell like it.. I am furious. DO NOT PURCHASE this product unless you have tons of $ and just like giving money away to crooks."
158771,0,Bought this for a gift so I don't know a lot about it but the recipient said they liked it. I liked that it came with slippers along with the other stuff. It was also a pretty good price compared to others I looked at. I do wish the overall presentation of it would have been better though. The labels looked plain so it made it look kinda cheap.
851,0,"It is not pure tea tree oil, so I'm not sure if it will make you break out when you put it on your face because there is also: soybean oil, safflower oil, and oother ingredients I can't pronounce. I just got it today, and it smells good, but I'm using it in the prospects of clearing up my acne; I'm not sure if it works yet, I'll update in about a week or so."
82716,1,"I find it interesting to look at the one star reviews saying it is a fake. Well those people probably didn't buy it directly from Amazon, and amazon has the 100ML one for an amazing price!! So why pay a few dollars less when you can get a REAL bigger one directly from amazon for a great deal. Make sure you note who you are buying your products from!!! This 100ml bottle is real and the fragrance lasts all day. :) Glad I didn't pay more at other online retailers!"
58853,0,"Maybe I was expecting to much I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can see maybe 10% impr in my face, my scars are still there no peeling with this product."
178605,1,I use this as my face soap and it is the only thing that keeps my skin clear! I have noticed my skin is not as oily during the day after I use it. I could not live without it.
131949,0,"This product does help define curls and fight frizz, however when it dries it leaves the hair crunchy and hard. I don't know if it's only this way on african american hair, but I used it the way my hairdresser instructed which is the same as the directions and you do need to use alot of product if you have really thick hair which can be expensive since I need something I can use daily."
82454,1,"The Amco Rub Away Bar is great. I have been using them for years. I also purchased 6 from Amazon before Christmas and gave them as gifts for some of my family members who frequently use alot of garlic and onions in there cooking. It is the only thing that removes the odors from your hands. It is a great product to have on your kitchen sink and looks real nice too. I have had many people ask me what that block of silver was, and when I tell tell it is for removing the smell of garlic, onions or fish off of your hands, all you do it run water and use it like you would a bar of soap and, WALLA! Garlic odors and onion odors are gone. They thought it was great. If you are a cook it is a must to have. No more going to bed and smelling onions on your hands all night!"
59689,2,"I purchased this yesterday. I've been itching and scratching all day at work. It made my skin really dry, much worse than soap. I would never recommendd this to anyone. I have no idea what these people are talking about, this stuff is awful. Years ago I had purchased the peppermint and it was just as bad. I've learned my lesson, won't buy any of Dr. Bronners products again."
236829,0,"I used to use lipsticks like these before - used to buy them from the 99c stores. They were very good 'cause they lasted for a loooong time and they went on smoothly. Since I haven't been able to find them in any store, I thought I'd try these. I didn't try all of the colors yet, but the one I did try did not stay on for nearly as long as I had hoped. It was gone after I had a cup of coffee."
105868,0,"It may not be fair to rate this product just yet, but I have used it for a few weeks and I'm a little disappointed in the results so far. I used the StriVecten Tightening Face Serum and I was impressed with some quick results, so I expected as much or better from the Eye Cream. If it's going to work at all, then it may just take a little longer to produce a noticeable appearance. I have a nervous habit of squeezing my eyes and the squint lines are starting to show, so this product will be challenged to perform as it claims and I'm going to hang in there a little longer!"
66459,2,"BUYER BEWARE !!!Be sure to purchase this dryer from the AUTHORIZED DEALER ONLY. This product might be a bit more expensive however it will save you hours of headaches and many dollars if you need to return the dryer within what you THINK is the warrentee period. Only the authorized dealer will stand by the 48 month warrentee. The dryer I purchased from Amazon broke before one year of use , it was NOT from an AUTHORIZED DEALER. I had a extremely hard time getting it replacemented. I was shuffeled back and forth between Amazon and the seller that provided Amazon the dryer; Glamor Beauty . After many heated hours on the phone with both parties, Amazon did send me what I think is a new dryer. It is not from an authorized dealer so I'm not sure how long this one will last."
68163,1,I love this scent of Burberry. It's far too expensive in stores or the Burberry outlet. This is an incredible deal!! The spray device is definitely not wimpy--just hold the bottle about a foot away.
115510,0,"This is not the best mascara I've ever used, but nice enough that I will use it up and then probably go back to Clinique. It seemed a bit thick to me, but I didn't have the problems others were having with smudging, flaking, not drying, etc. I did end up using my eyelash comb with it because it did clump. But I can deal. Don't expect a lot from it, I guess is what I'm saying."
43637,1,"So hard to find, glad they carry. Very happy with service, ordered on Thurs. 11/11 and rec. on Tues. 11/16 wtih the regular free super saver shipping. Good price too. Will order again thru this company."
249243,0,"I have liked Essie brand for years & was looking for a new base coat. I did my research and after reading reviews, etc. decided to buy this as I was also in need of a new topcoat. When Essie uses the term 'glaze', they meant glaze!! As a base coat it is slick and I found it to be very runny. It is a better topcoat, IMO. I do like the clear shine it imparts on a clean, natural nail and am wearing it by itself as I type this. The drying time is pretty fast, which is a plus. I do wish it was a bit thicker/gripped nail polish better as a base coat, however. It really came down between this & CND Stickey basecoat, so I think I will try that or OPI natural nail base coat next time. Otherwise, I think I will keep using this as a topcoat / stand-alone clear coat for my nails."
119613,0,"ok i must say for this the spin brush is great i dont think you can find a spin brush this cheap and works like its cost lots of money. when using the sauna it got really hot twice and on the third try it didnt get hot at all but the spin brush is still working great it takes two batterys and you can use any facial cleaner and use the brush to scrub it in more its not to soft and not to hard. the shipping was only three days. i would have to say if you are looking for a great sauna for the face this is not it but if you are looking for a great scrub the spin brush is great and well you get to use the sauna twice or maybe it might work longer for you, and i just had a faulty product. but after using the sauna my face felt really clear like it could breath and then to scrub it with the brush and wash it after my face felt clean and after that twice of using it i saw some good inprovements my face got more clear of dark spots and pore got smaller."
221759,0,"I bought this shampoo because I love shampoos that smell like peppermint and make my scalp feel all tingly, especially in the morning when I'm groggy and trying to wake up. This doesn't have a peppermint scent at all. The fragrance is sort of like a men's shampoo with some fruitiness to it. However, it does do a good job of cleaning my shoulder length hair. I like most of Suave's shampoos and use them all the time, but when a label says ""Peppermint"" that's what it should smell like. I won't buy this one again."
87025,2,I was very excited to try this product but was very disappointed with the results. I would not recommend this to anyone who has dry skin.
18686,0,"It does what it says as far as lightly moisturizing, but it doesn't do much for acne or combination dry skin (oily T-zone that is forehead, nose, maybe the area above and below the lips; dry cheeks)."
164339,2,"Product description states ""soft,"" ball-tipped bristles. To the contrary, the bristles are made of hard plastic. Soft material would be rubber, not plastic. Very disappointed."
166371,1,received this today (monday) and I believe I ordered it Saturday night. the color is gorgeous! I am ordering more as gifts and of course for myself. I am of Hispanic decent but lighter this time of year sheerly nude is perfect for me
123842,2,Well the price was good but we got the wrong thing. And the one we got smells like dirty water.
7934,0,This shampoos alright. sometimes it needs a bit more sudsing power and sometimes leaves my scalp a bit drier then i would of liked. but overall it seems fine for the price
171859,2,"I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE and I trusted him -- and then I decided to research it and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist! This is from Dr. Mercola's website:[...]""A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse. Treatment of the mice with Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin, or Vanicream for 17 weeks increased the total number of histologically characterized tumors by 69 percent.According to the study, as reported by Green Med Info:""The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of topical applications of moisturizing creams ... in humans.""This also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies."""
191,0,It's refreshing...excellent for exfolliation prior to tanning. Also very good for a pedicure. Mustinvert jar frequently to ensure the content remains moist throughout and ready for your next use.
20941,0,"Used it as the directions explain...for this if you put two coats on it is suppose to last for 7 days...I got color after about 2-3 hours as it states, but I have more of an orange look than a tan. Dries quick and the smell is ok. Hands turned orange even though I washed them right away, but I guess that comes with any self tanner...no streaks or blotches though, just more of an orange color."
135547,1,I purchased these towelettes just before a long road trip across country - these kept my face fresh and grease free - don't know what I did before we discovered them. WIll now take them with me everywhere.
174394,1,I've used this product four years and have introduced my daughter to it. She loves it too. It's just what the name implies: tinted moisturizer. Application goes on smoothly and it wears well. If you are looking for more coverage -- look elsewear. This just enhances ones complexion a bit and looks quite sheer.
36938,1,"this plate can be used with wet and dry hair, it is best to not damage the hair and leaves it shiny and silky!"
229566,0,"Just for the heads up, the actual item is a pack of 12 metal files with no handle. I'm not sure if it's a sapphire coat or not but it did look and feel different from the Sapphire Nail File I have.I bought it and returned it with no hassle . All 3 stars to the customer service. They're very resourceful and the refund process was quick.So if you just want to replace your old metal files, this might be the one you're looking for. But if you're specifically looking for a Sapphire Coat file, I'm not positive that this is it. However, you can always return the product with the full refund."
102995,0,This cream is comfortably moisturizing but what it intends to vanish is questionable. In my case the only thing that appears to vanish is the cream itself. That's all. Haven't noticed much difference in anything else.
93064,0,I bought this item at walmart because I was in dire need of a leave in conditioner. It's an okay product. But I would have much rather gotten a leave in that is creamy. This doesn't cut it. I use it just to use it.
40665,1,"First off it arrived quick,the packaging was very well almost kept the box. I love this item it applies very well, it is not greasy, and it smells good very suttle. I will deffinately order it again"
227263,0,The gel sheets are OK but don't stay on like it says it should. The silicone gel in the tube was more effective.
110094,0,"The product seems weak, for I feel the perfume in the oil is minimal. Possibly Sandalwood is not a good fragrance for this purpose. I will order again, but possibly with a more pungent variety."
117687,1,"This is the best bronzer out there. I have fair skin and while it looks so brown in the compact, it looks amazing on. Just use sparingly with a big brush and you will be fine."
213218,2,I was disappointed in the product because it smelled like it was very old. Perfumes and colognes tend to take on a metal-like smell when they are old. It did not smell like the J'adore I love.
212933,0,"Other liquid soaps I use were much more ""fluffy"". A few drops and it would bubble up and foam nicely in a few seconds on my wash cloth. This one isn't as fluffy as my usual Nivea."
244195,0,"This cleansing soap was very refreshing. It was not a heavy soap that made you feel like your pores were clogged for the rest of the day. It also left my dry-in-the-winter-time legs nice and soft. I could tell that it did moisturize a bit. I gave it only a 3 for an overall rating because the fragrance is fruity and overpowering. Despite the fact that I liked what the soap did, I didn't enjoy the flowery scent that lingered."
117452,0,I bought this as a cheaper alternative to Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree shampoo but it is a poor substitute. There is virtually none of the scalp tingling effect with this product. Just OK as a shampoo.
126450,0,"I have tried it with hasitation.however,I do not find hair in my hands when I water wash my head in the morning.I guess one goal is already in.I trust the product stops hairloss, but I strongly believe no product today can regrow hair in questioned areas."
86614,0,I immediately applied the polish to my 4-year-old son's nails. Initially he hated the taste. Whenever he put his thumb in his mouth he immediately pulled it back out and made a really ugly face to show his disgust. Success! Or so I thought. Over the course of about 3-4 weeks he eventually got used to the taste (can't understand why since it tastes terrible!) and thus is back to thumb-sucking (both of them). Great concept but useless when a child gets to a point where he/she actually LIKES the taste. Back to the drawing board :(
32347,0,"This mascara comes with a spiral brush which I found to just make my eyelashes clump together (I have thin eyelashes, may be different for those with fuller eyelashes). I ended up using a different mascara brush, and the color goes on heavy and dark, which can be nice at times, but for a work time look I would have to wipe a lot of the product off before applying. The product also smudges if any water touches it, but on the plus side it is easy to wash off.Edit: I have now been using the Manic Panic mascara and find much better"
214887,0,"I am a loyal user of Pureology shampoos and conditioners, but this is the first time I've tried this particular product. I've seen a lot of good reviews on here and a couple other sites that sell this product, but so far, haven't seen the results I expected. It's possible I rush doing my hair in the morning and haven't really taken the time to use this product like it's supposed to be used. So far, I'm disappointed, but will keep trying and will continue to buy other products from this brand."
75627,0,"This is the first time that I have bought false eyelashes, they are ok. obviously you get what u pay for. The eyelashes were not cut properly I had to cut and make even."
110711,0,"This product is supposed to be watery. You have to apply it with a make up sponge. The issue I have is that it doesn't tan your face like a self tanner, it's just a bronzer that washes off."
204778,0,"I was torn as to what type of review I should leave behind because I love love LOVE this mascara but I was seriously shocked by the ridiculous price the seller was charging for it. You could find this mascara at ANY Chanel counter for $30. Considering this seller is trying to sell it for $40+shipping, I am starting to wonder how much people are willing to pay to avoid stepping into a store.Either way, if convenience is what you are after, just buy it online on any of the Department Store websites that sell this product. At least that way, you could return it if you find there is a problem with the product without too much of a hassle."
228732,0,You must do your best to improve the quality of your item because you cannot afford that a customer buys an item so expensive and he will not arrive to find a great satisfaction.
144071,2,"I used this product for over a month. It prevents red zits, but clogs your pores in the process. It caused so many blackheads that I had to stop using it.This is the first time that I've written a bad review. It really is THAT bad of a product that I felt compelled to leave a bad review.I am generally a fan of Scarzone products, but I don't recommend this item at all."
138486,0,If your hair is even slightly moist this product really &#34;plasters&#34; it. Almost to a point that you can't get a comb through.
120210,2,"I purchase the PEPPERMINT OIL for the sole purpose of getting rid of Mice. It smells nice, but do no work. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I placed it in a burner, I put some in a spray bottle mixed with water, I placed it on cotton balls and placed them all around where I saw droppings. Nothing works, so don't believe the story that it works. It does not work. Also quite costly to burn, and mop floors and place on cotton balls, just to get good smell in your home . I have tried everything. These mice will not eat the food, will not touch the glue traps, will not touch the old fashion traps. They appear to be smarter than the people who make the food and the traps for them. Nothing works. They will destroy the toilet paper, but will not eat any brand of mice food we put down for them."
204455,2,I ordered the Eau de Parfum (EDP). I received a box that said it was EDP but the bottle inside clearly stated it was Eau de Toilette. It does not smell the same. It's old and smells bad. I am so disappointed!! They deceived me!
222436,0,This conditioner is Ok but I will not order again because there is conditioner in the big box store that are just as good.
122901,0,"Buyers do your homework!Return reason: Different from website description Buyer comments: Sellers Description:features 8 rings of nylon bristles, 9L X 3 1/4W which is larger than the one that was sent. Seller sent a smaller ""Handy size"" which is a cheaper one but charged the same price. Question...does amazon set thier prices as well?Sellers response:I regret the inaccuracy of the descriptive details for the item you purchased. Unfortunately, we do not have control over the item information Amazon publishes. The measurements and bristle ring count in the bullet points refer to the large size Mason Pearson brushes, however they do not make a large size nylon brush. For the purpose of detangling, a smaller head is preferable as it reduces the stress on moisture weakened hair. If a larger nylon brush is what you were seeking, there is the Universal which offers 7 rings of bristles and can be found on Amazon by searching for B004QY3SW8.As you bear no responsibility for this problem, I provide you with free return shipping via the attached PDF USPS mailing label which you can affix to the box.I have contacted Amazon to request that the incorrect descriptive details be corrected."

236389,2,This describes polish remover as being a mitt which I assumed was like for the whole hand to soak in. It's one little finger mitt and does not remove polish.
28337,0,sure if this is the real deal or some bootleg vesion.....so i dont know great price if its real...sucks if it isnt...smells a little weak
119925,2,Bought this One year ago to the day.It is DEAD... Blowing cold air at me. Took it apart..no fix.
82169,1,"I cannot believe I found this product on Amazon. I've been looking for this product for the last two years and never even thought to look here.This is one of the best detangling shampoos I've ever used. It's a rich, moisturizing shampoo that smells a bit like bananas and leaves your hair and scalp incredibly clean WITHOUT residue left behind. And, there is no such thing as a tangle after using this shampoo.I know this product is marketed primarily to African Americans, but if your hair is thick and heavy definitely try it. When it comes to anything that will get rid of tangles, I could care less to whom a product is marketed. My hair is very thick and wavy and hip-length. I am going to order some this weekend and look forward to heaven in a bottle at an extremely low price AGAIN.One of the things I remember was that I even used less of my regular conditioner. I spend my hair budget on conditioners:)"
52119,2,"This is NOT Bumble & Bumble product. I have used the Thickening conditioner for 6 months now, usually purchased from a salon, but for convenience I purchased it online. It smells different, is a different color, much thicker than REAL Bumble conditioner, totally different. I suspect it's been repackaged."
103733,0,"This product is lightweight - I expected it to be heavier. It looks good in the picture, but the real product does not look like leather. I might have returned it, but my husband liked it."
126348,0,"I first smelled this sweetwater soap in a store, and I *thought* that I liked it. Perhaps its scent was masked by the other soaps in the aisle, but whatever the case, I waited for months for this soap to be in stock at Amazon. When it was, I ordered a case, [...]. I know other posters considered the scent light, but to me, it's got a ""lightly fragrant and flowery"" scent that is pretty powerful in its staying power, and it's kind of creepy. It reminds me of a typical movie character, a strange, old lady who lives in a very odd house with too many animals and things around. Ok, that sounds wacky, but the scent is just icky. My husband says it lingers with a scent much like bug spray, and his hands are always dry. I really wanted to like this, too."
191798,2,"I don't have much to say about the product. Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received ""Dunhill Desire"" and not the Original ""Alfred Dunhill Desire"" which is in the listing description. Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version. I had it before, bought it for $15 on Canal St. and it's good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias. I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002 and that was really something... Stunning cologne. When I saw the image I kinda had a feeling that it's gonna be a fake, but I loved the originalk version so much, so I desiced to take a risk and.... boom, I got a bloody fake. Do not buy ""Dunhill Desire"" - it's a crap. Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one."
208598,1,"I have a professional hair dryer that has a short barrel. It holds the dryer without falling over. The only complaint is that the stand is not as long as I had thought and you really have to put it on the counter in order for it to be effective (just like the picture). Other than that, it works great and I am pleased with it."
215857,0,"This makes my hair feel a little softer, but it does not make it smooth or shiny: meaning it still frizzes w/ it."
84560,0,"My kids begged for Super Sudzer soap, and I had a coupon, so I relented. With a good coupon it costs about the same as other bar soap packs. You get 3 Super Sudzer bars to a box. We bought the watermelon scented. The scent is ok when you sniff it directly, and it smells ok (but not fab) on the kids' skin, but the day after I bought it I noticed the kids' bathroom smelled a little rank. I investigated (little boys are infamous for &quot;missing their mark&quot;), but couldn't pinpoint the source of the strange odor. I removed the Super Sudzer from the bathroom, and the rank odor left with it. Go figure."
175344,2,This cream is much different from the one I bought MyChelle directly. Quality and feel is not the same as the one I bought from MyChelle.
210766,1,"I love this lipstick! The color is more of a rose shade (not pastel), feels great on and last...even thru my cup of coffee! I will purchase in different shades!"
156689,1,"The color is gorgeous, deep and rich ...wears well. Can be complimented nicely by royal purple and silver if you wish to have a design. Beautiful color... but it does stain the nails blue..."
135584,0,"I followed the directions just as they were written. The hair color I mixed it with was a liquid and when unred was added, it turned into a black goo. A lot of the red in my hair did come out.... but I'm not sure which is to blame for my color turning out darker than intended, the hair color or the unred. I was going for a dark blonde and ended up with more of a brown."
34898,0,"This was not the powder I wanted. Clinique has another powder that has &#34;glow&#34; in the title, and THAT is what I wanted. This is okay, but it isn't very dramatic. It's fine for a light face or body powder with a bit of sparkle, but it does not show up well as makeup."
103003,0,"This products smells really good but the name is misleading. It is not a ""Vanishing Cream"" per se, and it says that on the box but it also says they call it a vanishing cream because of how it vanishes into your skin when you use it. However, the latter is not so true. It is a thick cream that definitely leaves a slightly greasy film on your skin, which is not bad if you are going to sleep. In fact, it is what you probably do want on your skin while you sleep. But they should make the word ""Vanishing"" vanish from the box."
56389,0,"Chi hair products are just like any other salon hair product. It's over priced, for being so average"
34845,0,"I only have two complaints about this soap:1. As it get's near the end of its use it turns into a weird, see-through, viscous gel. This happened after using it for over a month and a half.2. The size. If they were to double the size it would be great. While it's current size is perfect for travel, you can easily fit two of these into those soap dish travel cases. I just would rather have to buy one 7oz bar instead of two 3.5oz bars.With the negatives aside I have to say this product is perfect for people traveling or for those that no longer want to use shampoo's that dry out your hair.+Travel size+Smell+Lathers like a horse at the races in the middle of August.-Could come in a bigger size for those not traveling-Weird 'gelification' process near the products end-life."
163406,0,"The brush does not have a strap as pictured in the amazon photo. The handle wedges into the back of the brush, both items being made of hardwood, they swell and shrink with humidity or lack of humidity. It is a constant problem to maintain this connection. My search was for a shower brush, it is now advertised as a ""skin brush"". I can't think of a use I have for a skin brush."
106293,1,"These lovely, delicately fragrant, shae butter enriched soaps from the French Provence are absolutely wonderful!I bought Linden, Milk, Honey Almond, Green Tea and Verbena. All lather beautifully with a rich, soft and satiny consistency, leaving the skin silky smooth and clean. They all have beautiful and natural smelling perfume which is never overpowering. Some, specially ""Milk"", is so delicately scented that it can also be used on the face. These fabulous soaps offer a totally luxurious bath experience that one can savor and enjoy! They are very long lasting and do not leave any foamy soap suds, or ugly froth marks in the tub or the shower afterwards."
37366,0,"I did not realize when I purchased this perfume that I was getting a knock off version!!! Although its smells nice, its not the original!! The bottle is shaped different too..I'm disappointed.."
200070,0,"PROS: Dries fast, leaves hair shiny, several setting combos, long cord.Cons: Way too heavy, cool button gets pushed accidentally because of its location.I don't think it dries hair extremely fast but then again I do have lots of thick hair. If the cool shot button was moved and they took some weight off of this big boy then it would be a great hair dryer."
75545,0,"this is a good enough scrub as far as exfolliation is concerned but I am not crazy about the scent, also the tube is not that big."
241164,0,"This really didn't do much of anything. It seems well made and ergonomic, but the bristles were far too soft to actually go through my hair and massage my scalp. I bought a multi-pack of the cheap plastic ones and I'm much happier with those. For someone with very fine hair and a sensitive scalp (young children or the elderly), I think this would be a good choice."
54002,0,"I'm generally too lazy to write reviews, so my actually writing one will hopefully hold some significance. I've had this set for 2 years now and I believe that to be a fair amount of time to actually judge the working of this set of curlers.My set has not quit working like some of the other comments here. I have experienced the ""crimp"" in the curl where the curler is heated. I think this is probably one of the detriments of this particular set and one of the main reasons that the old school 1985 set I used for 25 years had a heated core in the center.My main difficulty with these rollers is that after leaving them on my head for 10+ minutes, my head overheats. The curls look great for about 45 minutes, but, as the day wears on, the curls become limp and lifeless and you are able to see the crimps from the rods and the area where the curlers sat to heat tends to become heavy and even oily. In other words, the humidity that these curlers produce can actually make my wavy hair frizzy as I go through the day. This is NOT something that I needed from my set. As I'm growing my hair out, I am on the lookout for a new set. Alas. I thought this was the one."
148839,2,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER! I JUST GOT MY PACKAGE AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. I PAID ALMOST $11 FOR THIS TINY BOTTLE THAT IS LITERALLY HALF THE SIZE OF MY CELL PHONE (galaxy s3)!!!! THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!! I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A BIG JAR OF THIS STUFF TO LAST ME AT LEAST A YEAR!! THIS LITTLE THING WON'T LAST MORE THAN 2 USES!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!
112593,0,"I have been using nail brushes for years. Since I work in a shop, my nails and fingers get extremely dirty. Well the brushes I got are for tiny tiny little people with even tiny hands. Since they were so cheap, I will use them till I find the adult size of nail brushes."
194074,0,"This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
140781,2,Product was priced to high for the quality of item...not as I thought according to discription
251175,1,I've always been impressed with the liz claibore line of products for men. I have to say that curve is among the best.
46225,1,"just makes you feel wonderful. Smooths on easily. Has a delicate fragrance. enjoyed especially by young adults, middle-aged women who don't mind spending a little more for a fine body lotion."
248356,2,"After reading all the great reviews about this product, I was surprised at how badly it irritated my skin. My skin is very sensitive and obviously it works for some, just not for me. But, you do get a lot of product for a very reasonable price."
154750,2,"This is sort of a lacquer with small black fibers. After putting it on my eyebrows, my eyes started to water and burn - I guess due to the chemicals in it. All it did was make my brows look as if I had used a thin black pencil on them. Spend your money elsewhere."
23804,2,"I purchased the Conair 20 piece roller set only because the rods were all the same size. I had some old rollers from a Clairol hot roller set that wore out. I had that set for probably 5 to 7 years. It lasted a long time and I wish they still made them.I have had 4 of the Conair sets in the past 2 years. It seems the longer you use them the longer it takes for them to warm up. I threw them out because I thought they were bad sets. I should have called the company and complained but I didn't know if I still had the receipts.I haven't found any other hot roller sets that will work for me. I have very thin & fine hair and I have to use a spray gel to set my hair. So the velvet rollers do not work for me. I have tried one of the ionic roller sets but they were so hot I burned my fingers.I have also tried the curling irons, but my hair doesn't hold curl very well with them. I am still looking for a set similar to the old Clairol set. If anyone has found something similar please let me know."
26598,0,"This fits tummy tuck scars well, but it loses its stickiness rather quickly. Be prepared to clean it daily if you're a man. Also, I'm not convinced the scar has healed any more quickly using this than it would have under normal circumstances."
84437,0,This stuff is ok but it didn't work any miracles. I probably wouldn't order it again. It's not silky feeling like normal conditioner.
116776,0,I purchased this item because I need a good curling iron and I like this curling iron because it heats up quick and fast.
14655,2,"Have ordered this item before without a problem - however - just had the opportunity to use first can of Adorn Unscented Extra Hold - it has a bad ""smell"" - actually made me ill smelling this on my hair. I cannot tolerate odors hence the reason for Unscented - very dissappointed - will not order from this company again."
105950,0,"At first I quite liked this product as it was recommended to me by a couple different friends, so I went out and purchased it. I didn't really feel the difference, but I only used it for a couple of weeks as it started to smell very medicinal (in a bad way) and I couldn't stand it."
45615,2,This scent is too pungent! I had to wash it off as it was giving me a headache. Love the product so will have to find another scent.
19841,0,"This product to me is just okay not out of this world great. For the money i thought it would be exceptional but their are alot of other products that are cheaper and work just as well. A word to the wise unless you have very long hair, dont add much of this product to it or you will end up with a greasy looking mess."
32580,1,"Had for 1 year, does a great job of getting out the knots in curly hair for our daughter. It can be a slow process but it works."
235120,0,This salts make you relax and they take care of your body aches. I bought them for my psoriasis but I don't see changes on my skin.
193454,0,The product glides on and dries quickly but flakes off very easily. Once the product was dry I brushed on some eye shadow which rubbed off some of the eyeliner. if you even slightly rub your eye the liner rubs right off.
50643,0,"i read all the reviews, this was even recommended by my stylist...While I agree the curl lasts and it definitely gets rid of frizzies, I absolutely **cannot** keep this stupid things in my hair!! I roll up a section, put on the clampy thing and by the time I've reached for the next roller, it had just slid right off. It takes me twice as long to roll my hair because I have to futz with each roller many times. And if it doesn't roll right out, it slips and sort of hangs leaving a huge clamp line in the middle of the wave.I have shoulder length, fine hair - lots of hair, but it is very fine. I'm assuming that's why it doesn't work for me.Your mileage may vary."
193105,1,"After a decade long search, found the perfect shampoo for me. Light and fresh, leaves the hair soft and in control. Moisturizes well and keeps hair really clean. And the super big size at Amazon prices.. What else can one ask for :D"
184082,0,"This is a very lovely color, I just wish it weren't so watery and didn't require 3 layers to reach optimal pigmentation."
64263,1,"Have used this for a couple of months now and definitely can tell a difference when I wake up in the morning. The most noticeable was when I took a nap this afternoon and didn't wear the pad. When I woke up, I noticed the wrinkles on my chest immediately from not wearing it. It loses adhesiveness after about 2-3 months, so then it's time for another one. It's very comfortable to wear, and I don't notice it at all when I sleep. My husband calls it my ""superman shield"" - says it looks like one, ha!"
16701,2,It reminds me of really cheap hotel soap. It dries out your skin. The smell is completely overwhelming and sort of makes you feel allergic. Does not smell like eucalyptus. Surprised Thymes would have made and approved this scent for mass release. GROSS!!!
137844,1,"Compared to other products like Jergen's body wash & Clairol's Herbal Essences (which smells great but doesn't moisturize well), Dove's deep moisture is the BEST! It has a light, pleasant scent & my skin always feels silky-smooth after using it. I even use it in place of shaving cream. The two 24 oz. & bonus 6 oz. body wash set lasts a LONG time & I get a lot of use out of the pouf too. Definitely a good bargain!"
70929,0,"Love the container. Easy, clean pump. Love the feel of the lotion, love putting it on, and it feels great on my face. Problem 1, the smell. Lord it stinks. I've got frown lines now - it's like Pavlov's dog - everytime I reach for the bottle, I instinctively frown. Oh, it eases after aprx 30 minutes, then you can still smell it sometimes, but it's not bad then. Problem 2 - and I don't know if it's caused by the lotion yet or not - I'm 'studying' the issue - I've started getting BLACKHEADS. I've never had them before - acne oh yeah, but not blackheads. So there you have it - I've been using it for aprx 1.5 months now - like I said - feels wonderful on your face, but get a clothes pin first."
230931,1,"AWESOME product! Once you start using it, there's no stopping. Even having a morning or a night without it, I can notice its wonderous effects wearing off. One thing's for sure, this product is SO good, you won't be able to stop using it. It makes your eyes tight and firm, and it takes away poofy-ness! It's really amazing; just keep using it, morning and night. I can't even fathom the effects it might have if you were to use it more than that. You'd probably end up with eyes like those pop singers. Ohh, also, make sure you put this on BEFORE you put on ANYTHING else. I just recently found that out, and the results are so much better. I used to put on my face cream before I put this stuff on. Forget that. If you want eyes like movie stars, this product is what you want. Hands down."
161689,0,"It's pretty good because it's dual voltage but the selector only works for low and not for high. It dryes too much, if you are not on the run, it will burn your hair, maybe i'll use it for welding or sort of, he he. I hope it won't melt in my hands, it's too powerful."
211381,0,"Beware, you do not need a lot of it. It is very citrus/metallic in nature. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice cologne, but can be overwhelming if you use too much."
114193,0,"As far as the deal (3 for $20ish) it's great. And these arrived quickly and in good condition, so my 3 stars is NOT for the seller. It's for the dye itself.I dyed over straight, bleached blonde hair and the color is very true to the box (though a tiny bit darker)This is a very rusty red, it doesn't look natural at all.It's not really what I was after, but maybe if I let it fade a bit, it'll look better.The dye itself is very creamy and didn't drip, but the conditioner is TERRIBLE. It left my hair feeling coarse and stringy. It was runny and came in a little packet like a cheap hotel conditioner, which makes it almost impossible to save some for later use.I don't love this color. It's very fake looking."
243455,0,I simply used it to wipe off the excess foam of my cleanser. I really don't care for the texture of the sponge and wouldn't recommend it.
28632,2,"Hope in a Jar is the product of marketing hype. This product smells like something out of a biologist's lab. It's also faintly yellow, and it reminded me of a chemistry experiment.When I put a huge blob on my cheek (before spreading it out), it left my eyes burning. Its smell and effects on my eyes make it difficult for me to believe in its goodness. At this price, people with sensitive skins are better off experimenting with brands such as Burt's Bees and Shiseido White Lucent (both tried and tested, in summer and winter. they worked)Skintype: Fair Asian, Normal - Dry skin in the US, combination in tropical Singapore"
154435,2,I've tried using this a few times. I am pretty bad at staying still after painting my nails and usually manage to ruin at least 2 nails per hand every time. It's really time consuming. So I thought this Quick-E drying drops would be my magic cure. I really couldn't tell a difference in drying time and I STILL smudged a nail or two. I also wasn't sure if these funky little bubbles in my polish were cause by the drying drops. I mean is there such a thing as applying it to soon? I just don't know about this product... I feel like I MUST be doing something wrong! :(
115349,1,I love this! I used the reviews that recommended this & they were right! This stuff is great in the Spa Wax Bath. LOVE IT!!!!
73605,2,"I like the way my hair looks at the beach with a little salt spray in it, but this did not give the same results. Made my fine hair look limp and dirty."
