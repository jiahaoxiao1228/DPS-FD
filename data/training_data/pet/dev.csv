80727,1,This is an informative book that my 17 year old son has found to be most helpful in choosing the fish that he wants in his tanks.
151668,0,"This is an excellent cat toy. Our cats go crazy when they see this toy come out and cannot wait to chase it. But, we've gone through at least 2 or 3 of these because they break quickly. The line becomes tangled and then the reel is useless. Usually I can fix the line but it fails again after a few more rounds. It's a shame, because it's an awesome toy when it works. I've stopped buying them at this point because it's too expensive for throwaway item."
198542,0,Can't tell that it is working. It does not say which button turns it on! So I tried it different ways. Do not feel any heat.
34364,0,"I have used Pyrethrin many years for general insect control, inside and outside, with great results. In my opinion, it is one of the best natural insecticides available on the market. The reason for 3 stars is that I was not aware of the difference between Pyrethrin and Permethrin, and there is no mention of this anywhere in the product description. When I searched Amazon for Pyrethrin, both products came up leading me to believe they were the same, only labeled differently.The difference being Pyrethrin is a natural extract from the chrysanthemum plant, and will not harm mammals, fish, or, birds. Permethrin belongs to the family of synthetic chemicals called Pyrethroids. It is extremely toxic to fish and cats, and has been linked to poisoning dogs as a flea/tick repellent. It is not as environmentally safe to use as Pyrethrin. Therefore, it is not the same thing, and I think buyers need to be made aware of this. Permethrin does work very well for general insect control, but I would be very cautious using it on dogs, or livestock for flea/tick and fly control. If you are looking for a ""natural"" insecticide, pay more for Pyrethrin. Otherwise this is a good product for general insect control, and is certainly less toxic than many commercial insecticide alternatives."
123017,2,"I used to give Greenies to my 2 dogs as an everyday treat.Do they love them? ABSOLUTELY! Do they seem to prevent bad breath? YES!Only a week ago, however, I had to take one of my dogs to the emergency room because he couldn't breath properly and he had to undergo an operation that cost me $2000!! The doctor told me she had seen this happening to other dogs so many times already. Greenies are VERY DENSE and can expand in the stomach, not to mention it can also block the throats. PLEASE PLEASE DO BE CAREFUL if you must give these to your dogs, but I would NEVER EVER give them to my dogs again.I am pretty sure someone will sue this company very soon."
28282,0,"This was the only lid I found that will fit the smaller cans of cat food. We have a kitten, so we only use about half a can per meal. Got tired of using saran wrap. So I tried this lid. The only downside is that the thing is very stiff which makes it a bit tough to remove from the can. If you dont have strong hands, or if you suffer arthritis look for another product. On the flip, it is tough, and it seems it will last until we move up to the bigger cans."
207793,2,"I bought this product out of desperation thinking that it would remove the tear stains under my puppy's eyes. As far that goes, I might have well have used water and a mild detergent instead, and saved $10.00.I followed directions, used enough product, and even applied the solution on a cloth a few times to clean the area under her eyes in order to make certain I was cleaning well enough, and still noticed very little difference in the appearance of the stains. I do realize that the product must be gentle so it doesn't irritate or inflame the eye area, but this was useless. I'd like a refund, but am not sure this is possible seeing that I ordered through Amazon and not from a store. Don't waste your money."
113462,0,"My dog loves dog beds - we have about 3 now, but I decided to order this one so she has one that is more 'portable' when we visit friends/family over the Holidays... It arrived yesterday, and is a nice color and material and the perfect size (36x23) for her (55lb) and she assumed the ahhhh position immediately, with head on bolster...The only issue I have is that it isn't really all that thick at all. I have it on a carpeted surface in the bedroom right now, and it barely adds any cushion at all... so I can't imagine what it will be like when we use it on hardwood flooring or tile... The bed area simply needs to be twice as thick as it is - or maybe twice as firm or something....So, its ok, but I am a little disappointed."
13141,2,"My cats love Da Bird cat toy but for whatever reason they are not in the least bit interested in this. They are probably just spoiled, but if you are looking for a cat toy, you are better off spending a few bucks more for a Da Bird, than wasting your money on this. Just sayin..."
121540,0,"I had been using a fairly tall but open-top sifting litter box. I loved the convenience to empty it, but one (or both) of my cats would often go over the edge. It was time to get a new one.I love the design on this one how the back is so tall. It prevents what would have gone over the edge on the old litter box from even touching the edge on this one. My cats immediately took to it. They do not even mind the flap which I thought I might have to take off for them.Complaint #1: Mine is not the product shown. It did come with a litter scoop but it does not have the holder on the side. The top is also different in that it is all one solid color with 5 even gratings opening towards the back. Those are not really big issues, but be advised that what you see may not be what you get.Complaint #2: The latches on the sides are not very secure. They are held on by about 1cm of overlap between the tab on bottom and the opening on top. I would definitely not suggest lifting it by the handle when it is full. It might be okay, but you won't want to be cleaning up all of that litter for the time a latch comes undone.I wish you could choose the color, but I was happy with the hunter green one that I received."
65900,0,"I'm sure this is a fine product; however, it didn't work so well with my dogs. I can't blame that on the product!"
134213,0,This nectar is available elsewhere but oriole feeders are the problem not the nectar. Currently I use sugar water and the bees and one local rat love the feeder. Hardly any birds use it.
55197,1,"The most important thing is to have a cat only household! Our dogs are much more interested in it than the cats are. Actually, if the cats got a chance they would love it!"
135417,0,"These stairs are functional, and my poodle of course uses them happily to get onto my bed by herself. However, I thought they were more padded or of better quality. They are made of a plastic frame that you have to put together and the carpeting is very thin and goes over the cheap plastic frame. I was a bit disapointed, but my poodle is happy; that's what's important overall."
83323,1,We bought this to keep our American Eskimo dog safely contained inside our camper (in air-conditioning) while we go out to eat in Myrtle Beach SC. I laid one side down inside the crate while we are still at home to let Ricky (the dog) get used to it and he loves it.PROS- Good product for the money. VERY STRONG. The 2 doors are convenient. The bottom tray is great in case of accidents.CONS- Minor gripe: I was surprised it was so heavy. I guess that's the price you pay for strength :DSUMMARY- I would buy it again.
149966,0,I have a yellow lab and she chew the duck apart in about 5 min. but the tennis ball is holding up great.
182777,0,"We travel a lot for work and aren't always around to take care of the litterbox; we had high hopes that this product would keep our cats happy. It does take some getting used to for the cats, it essentially freaked them out at first (very entertaining watching, but the cats could only hold out so long and they eventually used the box); so if you have cats that have a problem with not using the litterbox to begin with (not due to disliking dirty litter), this may be a problem.The good: Works moderately well. Easy to remove litter tray and throw away or dump and re-use. Keeps litter relatively clean, but has issues.The bad: VERY sensitive to litter type and amount. We went through several brands of ""Premium"" litter until we found one that clumped hard enough and fast enough to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan, interestingly enough it was the cheapest brand... Filling the pan with litter beyond the lowest level allowed caused the rake to jam on the backsweep, which makes it cycle endlessly. Any litter sticking to the bottom of the pan causes the rake to jam and re-cycle repeatedly. The rake tines become clogged with used litter after a bit. The rake gets most of the big stuff though the unit does require a hand going-through fairly often, but it's bearable because the litter needs to be changed out at that point anyway.The worst part is the longevity. We had both of the units fail after almost exactly one year. The first unit had the sensors fail, it would no longer detect when a cat had been in the pan and therefore would not activate the cycle. The second unit had the motor fail, probably due to endless cycling for one of the above reasons. That's over $200 spent for devices that lasted a year. Not a good investment; after the current box fails (an LME9000, an even more expensive yet worse product!) we'll bite the bullet and spend the $$$ on a litter-robot, it'll be cheaper in the long run."
116600,2,"I have a tiny dog and I was excited to find small dog treats that I don't need to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, my dog doesn't like these. I wish they came in bacon flavor!"
84443,1,"This isn't necessarily the easiest thing to set, but once yo get used to it it is fine. I just wish it had a smaller serving size for out cat. The smallest size it says is 1/4 cup but it puts more out than that"
135763,0,About 20% of the tablets were broken due to poor handling. The cosequin is a must for my dogs healthy joints.
44158,1,My cats will only drink fresh water. This becomes a hassle when youa re constantly changing the water in their bowl. I bought the pet mate fresh flow fountain with the hope that it would eliminate the need to constantly chnge the water. My cats love it. They will drink fromthe stream of filtered water without problems. The only drawback is that the pump clogs easily with cat hair and flow is decreased over time and requires dismantling and cleaning.
101813,1,"After buying another blue brand, I couldn't believe how much better this brand is to use. I won't buy another brand, and this seems to be the best price."
139887,2,"Don't buy this. It makes the mat activate on its own every few seconds. The mat works fine with batteries, and although I'd much rather not waste batteries, this power adapter is no good. Amazon shouldn't be selling it. On the positive side, Amazon is paying for shipping on my return."
178328,2,I purchased this item and it came without the filter piece that goes in the top of the littler box. As this was one of the main reasons that I purchased this litter box...I am very disappointed in it.
29361,1,"I have a 11 year old standard poodle who is having a hip problem that is causing her immobility. At the end of the first week I saw improvement and by the end of the 2nd week her movement was much better and faster. I received this product in just a few days. Shipping was fast.Nupro Joint Support for Dogs, 5 lb Silver"
11685,0,It works great but my cat has figured out how to turn the dial to the next feeding. She just kind of helps herself to more food when she gets hungry!
213195,2,"This could be a nice trap if they had a functional QA system to inspect the product before it ships to the customer. OK, so I receive my first Mantis trap and the trap door spring is broken into pieces with no damage to the box, which means it left the factory that way. I returnd it and received my replacement trap by mail and noticed I cannot set the trap because the trap door was not trimmed properly and sticks open. I did not want to send another one back and have to wait again so I took a razor blade and trimmed the excess junk plastic off of the trap door and finnally got it to work. I placed it into the tank and noticed in just a few days that the trap door spring was already starting to rust. I had a few different pests to capture so, I had to leave it in the tank for 2 weeks. The only good news is it did catch crabs, fish, snails etc. By the end of the 2 weeks the spring was rusted very badly. They should have made the spring out of corosion resistant steel since it is desighed for a salt water tank instead of using very low quality cheap junk metal. Keep in mind it is also possible to contaminate your water with the rusted metal biproducts and chemicals leached into your tank from the quickly disintegrating metal spring. This could be especially toxic to a small nano reef tank. I took the trap out of the tank and thoroughly rinsed off the salt water and immediatly dried it off to try and mimumize corosion. I stored it for 2 months and when I took it out of the box to reuse it the junk metal spring had rusted so badly it had crumbled into pieces, rendering the trap useless! If you purchase this trap realize it is so poorly manufactured that it will only last you one use and into the trash it will go. Hopefully it will catch the pest before it falls apart and poisions you reef tank. I would not recommend this waste of money to anyone! Thanks for listening.Don from Minnesota, 13 year reef tank owner."
73044,1,This is a very useful item when trying to groom an unruly cat. I like all the zippers that lets you take one limb out at a time to remove mats.
182341,1,"Our ball-crazy Lab LOVES these. He won't touch tennis balls but will fetch these for 20 minutes straight. Highly durable, even for a chewy Lab puppy. Great bounce. Just wish they'd quit getting stuck under the deck and in the creek. We bought six at a time."
94730,2,I bought this for my pug mix after getting too many complaints from my roommates about barking while I was gone. I wanted to try this before getting a shock collar because my dog is pretty sensitive to discipline. I thought this collar was going to be great because she barked once and she did NOT like getting sprayed... unfortunately 30 seconds later she just shook her head because the device is uncomfortable and it sprayed her. So then she was very confused and didn't trust anything while wearing it and just cowered in a corner. I feel it is too inhumane to make her wear it.. disappointed.
29919,1,My dog loves this toy alot. She mostly play only with this.Con is legs fell apart very easily but well I can buy new one from here again.
52635,1,"Solid, well made and beautiful. The squirrels don't like it although they still manage to get into it. Great for smaller birds. Blue Jays don't seem to like it."
74987,0,Ball flashes only occasionally and the sound is very faint now. Not worth asking for money back. Bad product from my viewpoint.
138059,0,My dogs scratched the zipper till it split open. Now he knows how to get out... Nice for driving in car
53217,1,"I would recommend this puppy food! We have a puppy that got off to a sad start. We found him along an interstate with a broken shoulder and was malnourished. After surgery on his shoulder and good nutrition with Hills Science Diet, he is a thriving, healthy and happy guy!"
15880,2,"Batteries run out quickly on the reciever. It worked well at first, then quickly lost it's consistency. I would press the button up to 10 times before I heard a beep. My dog did not do well with it. Currently looking for another one, and wishing I had not spent $100+ on this item."
9877,1,"Hi,Hamster saga link (Super Pet CritterTrail Discovery Deluxe Habitat)We bought 4 of these cages to house our rapidly multiplying dwarf ham population (see Hamster Saga.). Unlike its predecessor, this HAS A WHEEL, a REQUIREMENT for hams. This is a great cage, but if you have more than 1 ham, buy a larger cage like the Dazzle Habitat or the Crittertrail Discovery.So, to sum up:Pros:-AWESOME WATER BOTTLE!!!!-Good wheel, can get dirty-Handle is ever so convenientCons:-Not enough space for 2 hams-I wouldn't try it with a Syrian (teddy bear or golden)-Door kinda small, hard to get to hamsPie!"
129164,0,"I have one I previously got from Walmart and I figured it was the large one but it was not. I still love them, very sturdy and good if you get caught out walking after dusk."
44239,0,"This fountain was difficult to put together. It worked well for the price. However, my cats were afraid of it, and I was unable to get them to use it, even once they got used to it. I'm not sure if it's a cat thing or what. I gave it away to someone else to see if their cats would use it."
110193,2,"Not really impressed with this. I have a large dog and she is not very graceful. Within a couple of days of her running into things it cracked down the whole side. So I used clear tape to patch it back up. Within another couple of days it cracked down the other side. One last patch there, and then the snaps that hold the cone together broke off. Waste of money and time in my opinion."
123,0,"I bought this gentle lead with high hopes that it would help my little monster, Olivia. Unfortunately, even though it was the smallest size possible, it was still too large for her (she's a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese.) Luckily, though, Amazon was super accommodating and issued me a refund--and even said I didn't have to ship back the product. 5 stars for Amazon; not so much for the gentle lead's company."
156005,2,"I ordered this peek-a-treat ball for my border collie and maybe she got bored easily, but in 5 minutes she went from playing with this thing to eating it. Half an hour later, I'm at the emergency vet having pieces of it pumped from her stomach. The plastic seems VERY soft for a dog to be connecting ""treats"" to ""toy"" - just my opinion, don't use it without VERY close supervision on your dog. It cost me over $500!! Also, when I tried to contact the company about the problem, I received my registered letter back as ""NO SUCH ADDRESS"". Hmmm."
156015,0,"My Yorkie, Breonna looks so cute with these bows in her hair. I think It would be better if the elastic bands were a little bit bigger."
37675,1,"Just wanted to add what everybody else is saying. It works GREAT. No more scooping.I do have a little bit of trouble with it sticking to the sides because my cat likes to pee (a lot) up against the side, but that's because my cat is weird, and not because there is anything wrong with the product. I am really glad I replaced my old box. Worth the price twice over."
152284,2,"For those of you replacing the button battery yourself and don't want to pay for shipping, My local Batteries Plus has the CR-1/3N for $4.99 and in stock. I'm going to buy a few after work today. I did get advertised 3 months out of my two PetSafe Cats shock collars and they were on the whole time, but I'm using them with the Indoor Radio Fence to keep my cats off my expensive surround speakers so maybe they don't get shocked as much as an in-ground fence. BTW, Home Depot has very reasonable prices on these collars and PetSafe stuff, some you have to order and some is available in store. I bought from them because I didn't like giving my CC info to some random small site online that I never heard of before and I can return the PetSafe stuff to any Home Depot if it doesn't work out for me but so far so good."
32436,2,"I have a cat who would rather die of dehydration than drink out of an ordinary bowl...she is such a princess!! I bought this item from a local pet store and it was WAY more expensive than on Amazon (about $20 more), I wish I had looked here first even though I don't think it's worth the $30 they are charging. I have to say that the fountain is incredibly noisy, whether it is full or not and it is about as equivilant to my cat crying for water from the faucet. Also, if it isn't cleaned every week or so it gets so clogged with gunk that it won't even run and cleaning it is no easy feat. You have to take the whole darn thing apart and the electrical chord isn't detachable. I think the filter is just really a ploy to get you to spend more money becuase it doesn't last more than two weeks even with regular cleaning. My cat loves it though and it is the only product that she will actually use, so it's just one hassle trade off for another."
147237,2,"We've tried sonic collars,and other training aids with no joy. So we tried this product with high hopes. But after using it for about 4 hrs. we found it to not for our family. If you feel that your dog is family just think about putting a shock collar on your child. This product may work well for others but not for us!!!!!"
29129,0,My cat likes this one so-so. Doesn't clean the dish like she does with the tomato bisque flavor but it smells soooo bad its unreal! Won't buy this flavor again but will stick with the brand...
61261,2,"My girlfriend usually takes care of the normal type of litter box of our three cats and when I walk by and see her all hunched over and working so hard to clean the thing I don't like it. So, I got her one of these hoping that the cleaning job would get much easier. It did not. This thing is loud and it gets filthy and requires just as much cleaning (if not more) than a regular litter box. This piece of crap now sits out in the garage and will be heading to the dump very soon. Do not buy this litter box because you will waste your money.Instead, get the rolling litter box called The Omega Paw also sold here for much less cash. I purchased on last week and we both love it. You just put the enclosed litter box together and when you want to clean it your roll it over on its side and the clumps of dirty litter roll into a little catch basin. The basin is actually a drawer with can be removed and the clumps of litter dumped in the trash. We both clean the litter box now. Omega Paw rocks! We got the large one."
20691,0,"I purchased a 4# container of this for my dogs because fleas have been bad this year and the poison I had been using was not working.I didn't like using the chemicals in the first place, but whats the point if it doesn't work!?!?!?!?I seen results overnight!!! I used the summer dosage and by the next day there was almost no fleas left.Within 2 days there was none!!!!So -- when I reordered -- I am getting the BIG ONE!!!!I highly recommend this productUPDATE -- 11/28 -- I am thinking the 25# one I got is not the same as the 4# -- the picture shows the same, but I have to use quite a bit more of this product to get the same results I got with the 4#So now I have to order another 4# to mix with my bigger one to see if I can get it to work betterLike the previous review mentions -- this does not come with any Naturevet markings -- it is in a plastic garbage bag -- which would not be a problem if it was the same stuff as they have pictured"
203332,0,"My sister originally told me about the Furminator. Don't get me wrong, it does the job. However, it will also scratch your dog if you are not careful. My dog really hates it, and like I said, I have scratched him with it - even though I am diligent in not doing so. Just be careful if you get this."
122426,1,"This container was our perfect solution for storing dry dog food in our sunroom. We feed our four dogs in the sunroom and wanted the food close. We had been lugging it from the garage to the sunroom, which for several reasons was not the best situation. Not to mention having the food in the garage attracted some ""varmints"" we would rather not have around. It's a good size, very stable (almost impossible to tip over) and easy on/off lid. Would purchase again and probably will purchase another one down the road."
145583,0,"Be sure to check your crate before ordering! Screws were way too short. When the fasteners are screwed on the screws there is only ~1/8"" between the head of the screw and the fastener. I ended up buying screws that were twice as long, 1 3/4"", that fit perfectly. Otherwise, the width of the screws fit the crate and the fasteners worked well."
111567,2,I was not happy with this collar - it is way to stiff - it felt like it would dig into the poor puppy's neck. I gave it one star because it is cute.
78493,0,"perhaps I haven't got the setting just right but when my dog tries to get in front of me while walking with this harness, it slips to the side and he can get his leg out of it. When this happens, the harness is ineffective. I took it to our dog training class, which is the place that recommended it, so they could help me with the adjustment. They admitted it's difficult to work. However, when my dog is not anxious to get ahead of me, the effect of this harness works which is to say, he would rather walk next to me in a calm manner."
41916,0,"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it."
95357,2,"I ordered 2 of these collars recently. one is almost 2"" smaller than the other although they are ""one size"" fits all. THEY DO NOT BREAK AWAY when snagged. I like the thinness, but it could kill your cat!"
22544,1,"We have six cats and all of them loved to be groomed with either a flea comb or a small brush. I was very excited by all the positive reviews regarding the FURminator as a good solution for shedding and hairballs. I read the directions and was super excited to groom our cats. With the exception of our two males all of my cats really disliked being groomed with the FURminator...so I ran it through my own hair because it must be doing something that irritates them. While obviously not having an ""undercoat"", I did notice the tool pulling my hair (it's obviously not a comb, so I expected something, just not sure what) and pulling it out or breaking it off -- while it didn't ""hurt"", it was not like having a brush through your hair. So my cat's discomfort was probably from the pulling of their undercoat out. My best solution is to keep the grooming sessions short, to hold my cats skin so it wasn't pulled as much and to groom lightly (as stated in the directions). My two males really enjoyed it, however, they too after a few minutes politely had enough.The tool takes out tons of hair -- just like all the photos in the gallery...just be careful not to use too much pressure or get over zealous -- let your cat tell you when enough is enough.I gave the product five stars because it does exactly what it says it will do -- it's just that some animals are more sensitive to the pulling out of their undercoat then the advertising shows. The directions are clear about warning the user about using too much pressure, which is great."
62321,0,"I have heard good things about this product and purchased it to use on my 23 lb. Boston Terrier and on my 28 lb. Bedlington Terrier. I ordered it from Amazon and received it quickly. It works, neither dog has had any problems with fleas, ticks, etc. which is great because our home backs up to heavy Oregon woodlands. I did follow package instructions. The only ill effect was that my Bedlington Terrier lost all of his coat wherever the product was applied between his shoulder blades. It looks like someone just shaved it down to the bare skin. Hope it grows back! I have talked to several other Bedlington owners since, and this seems to be a common reaction. Since Bedlingtons have sight hound ancestry, and sight hounds are known to be sensitive to this sort of flea treatment, I'd be very hesitant to use it on sight hounds as well!(i.e., whippets, greyhounds, salukis, afghans and italian greyhounds, etc.) This seems to be a good product, but perhaps not for these particular breeds. Consult your vet."
213050,1,"My ratties piled inside the snuggle sacks every. It was a common site to see three or four tails hanging out of the opening. They adored them, but alas they also chewed them to shreds much to quickly."
188317,0,7mo Retriever/Shepherd mix. Two days.I guess it could have been worse.
36169,0,"I LOVE this product. I really do. I have a Rotweiler and a German Shepherd puppy. These collars stop them from pulling my arm out of the socket when they lunge at a cat on the street, for example. I will note this problem with the product: It is not Rotweiler proof. My Rotweiler has chewed through 3 of these in 2 months. And I don't leave them lying around. These are the rogue chews she gets in when I'm putting the collar on and she's squirming all over the place (as getting these on big dogs can be a wrestling match). This is a key problem, I believe, as these are designed to make it easier to control big dogs. Why is the material so flimsy? (aside: I am also training these dogs. This collar is not a substitute for good training to teach dogs to be calm on a walk, but until my dogs get there, I really need these headcollars to hold up!)Please, Gentle Leader people, design a ""super tough"" headcollar made of a material that's more durable. I would purchase this even for a much higher price if it would last for the lifetime of a big dog and not get chewed through"
117898,0,"I read the reviews on this product and felt skeptical that so many people had such a difficult time placing the tape. Then my roommate tried to apply it and experienced every complication that others had. However, when I placed the product down I had no trouble. Yes, it can and will double back on itself if you're not careful. But placing it on the rug, smoothing it down, and then lifting the top protecting sheet prevented most problems. I held down the corner of the sticky tape as I removed the paper, pulling the paper at a 45 degree angle instead of straight up, and the entire sheet laid smooth. If I had it to do over again, I'd just buy double sided tape."
121673,1,I use 4 of these for snakes and frogs(not to feed the snakes). I keep a spare for failure but have not needed it.
3462,2,"I bought the AquaClear 50g filter for my tank because reviews said it was one of the quietest. However, after a year, the impeller began to grind and rattle, so I bought this replacement one in hopes of stopping the noise. Unfortunately, I will never know if a new impeller would have solved the problem. The first one I received came in a smashed box and had two blades cracked off. So, I returned it for a replacement, and received another defective impeller (no blades cracked off, but it had come loose from the plastic box during shipping and bounced around, causing wear and tear, and when placed in my filter, was exponentially louder than it had ever been) due to improper packaging. So, I returned THAT one for a replacement, and the third impeller had one blade cracked off. It's not worth it to keep asking for replacements if they won't improve the packaging. These impellers are delicate and the littlest chip will cause the impeller to rattle in the filter. That said, I do not recommend buying this impeller online. If you can find another place that packages it properly, then go for it. But not Amazon."

42631,0,"I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent. Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach.Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms. (Both bags were not expired.)I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system.I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not.If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods."
207948,0,I have 3 cats that have only rear claws and a bag only seems to last 2 or 3 days. I guess its better than not having a bag at all though.
99924,2,This item is a waste of money!! My dog still scratches and it smells horrible and leaves the smell on there fur and also stains it if they are light color!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!
213587,1,"I was guessing at the size, but settled on the XS for my 7 1/2 lb. pug puppy. I was very pleased with the fit, considering pugs can be difficult to fit with these types of garments. There is actually room for her to grow in it! She loves it, too!"
19791,0,"Well, our three cats went crazy with these toys, which lasted about the first hour we had them. Now I do not know where the toys are hiding. We tried to play with them here and there, they showed little interest after the first few minutes. Kind of disapointed, but each cat likes different things. I did enjoy watching them play while it lasted :)"

57082,2,"Hey there all cat lovers:I have always been a multiple cat household, and my babies never, ever go outside. Having read some of the one and two star reviews, I now see the light...So here's my story.About seven years ago, I had eight cats at the time, and I took everybody to the vet. He recommended Advantage, and applied it to them at the office. Each of my cats had a localized reaction the this stuff. The worst was similar to that which I've read from customers using Frontline Plus. He had a serious burn, which continued to deepen and widen for about 60 days, including loss of the fur around the site. I am an R.N., so I was using many topical medications and ointments on his poor neck. It took 5-6 months for it to heal. My cats are of various breeds, both long and short hair, so needless to say, I never used Advantage again, even if it did kill the fleas.Now, in the years since, I have purchased Frontline Plus for Cats, from the vet's office, from PetCareRx.com, Pet-Meds.com, and most recently (July,2011) from Amazon.com. In every case, the LONGEST amount of time my cats were flea-free was 15 days!!! This last time, 13 days after application, one of my babies was sitting next to me on the couch, and a very healthy flea jumped on my arm and started chewing...So I am out of ideas; I've spent hundreds of dollars for this product, and it does not work for the time stated! Given it's warning, I don't dare re-apply sooner than 30 days for fear of over-everdosing them. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear from you.On a different and more important note, please, please, do not, for the sake of any pet you own, use any services of any BANFIELD VETERINARY HOSPITAL, located nationwide inside of Petsmart Stores. In short, they were responsible for either not diagnosing or misdiagnosing two of my cats, both brothers, now both dead. They died within 4 months of each other. The last one who died Sept. 4, 2011, was given a perfect bill of health, this giving me the PLEASURE of purchasing a 12month medical plan, which supposedly covered all of the basic necessities he would need (twice annually dental cleaning, complete bloodwork, complete physical exam, etc. During his dental cleaning, he ""needed"" three teeth extracted (not covered). Everything is ala carte. That cost an additional $289.00, the medical plan was $300.00/year, with a sign up fee of $79.95. Medicines were additional. In April, when his dental was done, he was given a perfect bill of health. Eight weeks later he had lost alot of weight, and I knew it had to be cancer. I took him back, saw a different vet, who said he had a large mass in his colon. Five weeks later, he was gone. He held on, with all of my love and care and praying to the Universe for some kind of intervention (I believe children and pets should be off limits, folks), but, a mere skeletal shell of the beautiful, green eyed, Egyptian marked long haired, fat tailed magnificent boy that he once was, left this plane of existence.Now, here is the kicker everybody; I am being overwhelmed with phone calls and letters, telling me I am OVERDUE in my monthly payment of $30.00, which I am expected to pay until April, 2012!! Two vets did not do their jobs, they committed mal-practice, I have no cat, but they want their money. What would you do?Thank you for reading and kind regards,Patti Dean"

I spend more time looking for these than the cat get's to play with them. I found some fake fur covered bell balls that don't roll around so well which work much better as my cat gets to play with it longer. Plus, if these things hit a hard floor - i.e. the kitchen, they are LOUD! Wow, wake you up in the middle of the night loud."
65762,0,"I knew with the Chicago summer looming that my dog wasn't going to do well in the heat, and with our daily walks as a MUST for living in a small apartment I knew I needed to figure out how to help her stay cool.After reviewing all of the bandanas and comparing pricing I went with this one - they were all similarly priced, from what I remember, but I had already spent $60 on a cooling jacket for her and didn't want to spend much more. (As a side note the cooling jacket ended up being a LIFE SAVER this summer and really seemed to help. The jakcet I bought works on evaporation, not the crystals.)Unfortunately I had forgotten that I ALWAYS have the same issue when it comes to putting bandanas on my dogs - they NEVER seem to stay on! This one was no different!Maybe it's because she is a deep chested dog, but almost as soon as I would tie it on it would fall on. I always ended up wearing it for her on our walks, which totally defeated the purpose!I would reocmmend putting some velcro or something on it so it can be secured on the dog.As far as the crystals retaining the cold, however, the bandana did an excellent job. It would stay cool for HOURS and would only need to be soaked for a few minutes to start the process. Even when the bananda looked all dried out and used it quickly grwe to size after a quick dunk in ice water.I actually ended up finding out that the bandanas are pretty useless at cooling your dog, and you're much better off utilzing a vest or other method.I think the bandana might work well in CONJUNCTION with a vest, as the vest I bought had a huge gap in the chest/neck area."
78404,2,"After searching and trying numerous harnesses and collars that would prevent my one year old Weimaraner from pulling, I thought I had found a winner in the Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness. I was thrilled with it the first time I used it, but the honeymoon was soon over. After my first walk without my dog pulling, I got home and removed the harness. There was blood on the part that latches under the dogs chest and I quickly became concerned. I looked under the dog where his front legs meet his chest, and his skin had been rubbed raw. My vet also sells this item and I had an appointment that night, so I took the harness with me to ensure that I had it fitted correctly. She assured me that I did and this is a common problem with this harness. There is a flaw in the design and they do not fit well for all dogs and she doesn't recommend them for Weims. I would highly advise looking for another solution if you have an athletic dog with long legs. I switched to a British-style slip collar that my trainer recommended and we are now both walking happily with no pain."
88368,1,We had the older (smaller) version and one cat liked it and the other didn't. But they both like this one.Why? I think it's because the water comes out higher and it reminds them of the bathtub faucet (which they love to drink from.)
151362,2,"If you are like me, you are probably thinking of getting this because you have a cat who is crazy about food, or you travel occasionally, or you are tired of getting pestered for food at early hours. My cat eats anything and everything. Bread, pasta, uncooked rice, flour, catfood, people food. I've caught him fishing old spaghetti out of the garbage disposal. So i can't just leave him with a big pile of food cause he would eat it all on the spot. This product appears to be an ideal solution. And it's a great concept, but it fails in execution.If your cat is persistent at all, he/she will eventually figure out how to get food out at will. It may take a few weeks, but it will happen. The first problem is that there is a flimsy plastic cap covering the part where the food comes out. My cat broke it off after a few weeks. Then he could just stick his paw up and jiggle the auger until food fell out. So I duct taped it as tight as could be. Then I realized he could still fit his paw up through the opening to jiggle the auger, which he had probably been doing all along. So I decreased the size of the opening with duct tape so it was big enough for food to get out but too small for paws to get in. That worked for a while. Then my cat figured out that if he whacked the entire feeder sideways against the wall, it would displace the auger and dispense more food. So now it's thump thump thump all night long as he eats to his heart's content. The problem is that the auger sits inside of the shaft very loosely. So it really doesn't take a lot of force to move it, and then food can flow around it by gravity. Once your pet figures it out (and they will), this expensive feeder becomes little more than a feeder bar that will give the pet all they desire on demand, defeating the original purpose.I will probably go back to hand feedings, and use this only when I am out of town (for which it is very handy). I also have a crazy idea involving locking the feeder securely in the closet, and using a funnel and rubber tubing delivery system to drop food into a bowl, but that might be too complicated to work. I could only recommend this if you have a pet who's not nuts, or who lacks the determination and agility to get food however necessary."

Additionally, I ordered what I expected to be a regular sized Chuckit! but was sent an item labeled "" Chuckit! Ultra Grip Ball Launcher Medium/Moyen ""(great marketing move for Canadians, eh?). I was expecting the regular size/ larger size I've seen at dog parks and stores.

I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation???? The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients. Well I'm DONE. My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools. I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.

102643,2,"I have been looking at this online for months and finally ordered it. The photographs do not show that the base arrives in TWO halves that you have to connect with wooden dowels, then screw to the bottom of the post. The seams in the sisal are on both sides of the post, plus the seams in the pale, almost yellowish, pressed ""wood"" are on the other two sides, so no matter which way you position it, you're either looking at a very pronounced fabric seam or two sections of cheap pressed ""wood"" that don't join well. It wobbles on my hardwood floor. I have 3 cats who each checked it out, then went back to their Molly & Friends cat tree with sisal rope wrapped around one of the poles. I do like the height of this post, but that's the only thing I like about it. I hate the base being in TWO pieces, the color of the pressed ""wood"" is very unnatural, and the seams in the sisal are so noticeable, and on both sides. The sisal is also darker than it appears in the pictures. The screws on the top are are bright and shiny, no attempt to camouflage them. It is not symmetrical, straight, or square. The top sticks out more on one side than the other, etc. It looks very cheap!! And as you may have guessed, it's made in China.. which they also don't mention. Very disappointing!"

52493,0,"I didn't look at the case of dog food when it arrived too carefully. When I started to feed it to my dog I found that half of the cans were dented. Not a big deal, at least not until I got to the cans that were dented so badly that they had lost the seal. It was all moldy at the top and I had to throw those ones out. My dog does love this, but then he loves all canned food I have given him. I bought this because it is one of very few canned dog foods that are meant for puppies, and it was one of the most affordable ones too. I was disappointed that the food comes all ground up in a paste. Some of the adult Purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see (there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back). I have also read up on some of the ingredients here and I am going to switch to another brand with better ingredients and with ingredients that I can actually see, even if it means feeding my dog an adult formula. Purina isn't bad, but if you can afford to spend a little more there are much better brands out there."
46739,2,not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat. I have to take it away from her after a few minutes so she doesn't eat too much. If she eats the whole thing she gets the hershey squirts (liquid stool frequently). I think a better long lasting treat is peanut butter inside a bone or kong FROZEN. That keeps her busy and she doesn't get sick.

28152,0,"I picked these up along as a replacement for the Feline Greenies that I usually get for our two cats. They swarm on me and attack when I have the Greenies and they do the same with these but they don't seem to enjoy these as much. One of our cats likes them as much as the Greenies but the other one seems indifferent. If you feed them to her directly from your hand she will eat them, otherwise she just lets it sit there on the ground while the the other cat swoops in to try to steal it away. It would be one thing if she were a finicky eater but these are about the only things she doesn't devour upon sight.Besides the taste test, I like the fact that they are big enough to actually force them to chew them. I noticed that our cats would swallow the Greenies in one gulp which seemed to defeat the purpose of the tarter control. With the Purrlicious, they have to chew on them a bit before they swallow. That being said, I am a little disappointed by the lack of feeding directions on the package. The Greenies package tell you exactly how many to feed them but no such info here. I wouldn't be so concerned if the vet hadn't told us that one of our cats needs to lose a pound or two.Overall, these are OK but I don't know whether I'll continue to get them over the Greenies since they are a lot more expensive."

The other issue is there in-line shut off valves are junk as well. Lost $400 of Orange Mellow Angels because I had the hose in the tank with the valve shut off....got a phone call and came back 40mins later to continue my water changes to find a broken heater and dead fish with 1/4"" of water in the tank. Valve was definitely shut off! I did a test with it on another tank and witnessed it drain a 30 gal tank in 40 minutes, with valve shut off, they leak around seal....needless to say, it got pitched and I got to flush cash down the drain (dead fish). I still use them however, I hook it up directly to faucet to fill tank and use a clamp to hold hose to utility sink to drain with it. Trick is to start filling tank with it on faucet then turn water off, unscrew it and it will start the syphon for you. Hope this helps."

It scared me badly but after some research I realized it was an allergic reaction, I'm glad it was nothing more serious because it was a saturday night and the next day was a sunday and almost all the pet clinics were closed except for some far away.

And if there's any noise at all while he's near the food tray, he panics and runs.My guess is that the first time he tried to eat, the thing moved with his head in the way. It doesn't move fast enough to hurt him, or cause him to get stuck - but that's the only reason I can imagine that he's so afraid of this. Maybe if there was a motion sensor, that would help. But - you get what you pay for :)"

I know others use women's sanitary pads but that didn't hold all of the urine. Depends seem to work better. Also, the diapers fit great when i first got them but after washing a few times, they are more loose. I went down a size and it was way too small, so my dogs occasionally wiggle out of them.All in all, They seem to be the best option available on the market for right now."

30412,1,"I have two ferrets and a medium size dog(45lb) all three love to play with this toy. It lasted for the ferrets for about 6 months but then my dog was playing tug with it and one of the balls on the end fell off so I sewed it up and no longer let her play tug. Besides that it is a fun interactive toy that little ones(ferrets and friends' dogs) love to ""kill"" but it should not be a toy that they have access to when unsupervised."
204147,0,The laser was kind of cool but the images didn't work as well as the strait pointer. Besides that it was a complete waist of money for me because my cat dosn't pay any attention to it. I guess it would be a decent tory if your pet actually plays with it.
47412,0,"This stuff does the trick for filtering and keeping tanks looking good. However, If you don't have ammonia issues in general, it's a little pricey. We have Koi, and they're notoriously dirty fish, but with routine maintenance we don't have ammonia spikes or nitogen issues. A standard activated carbon works for us, and we order that from a chem company. However, if your tank needs some dire or extra attention, this is the way to go. Does several jobs at once, and works quickly provided you have a decent filtration system."

95781,1,"I would agree with all of the great reviews of this product (and my thanks to each one who took the time to write a review). This product is basic, but simply terrific for removing poop from grass. It quickly and cleanly gets all of the poop, which is much better than my other spring loaded ""grabber"" type scoop, which worked well in snow but left lots of poop smears in my grass and ripped out a bunch in the process. This scoop was also super cheap to buy.A few comments: I can see how this might not work as well for a dog w/extremely small poops, but for my 50lb Boxer, it's just fine. I can get at least 2-3 at a time before the basket is full. (I keep a metal trash can in my garage lined w/biodegradable bags and throw out the poop once a week with my trash.) I would also agree that it works better to let the poop sit for a day or so before trying to pick it up -- it holds together better when you scoop it that way. Some people said the handle is too short; I am 5'4"" and the handle length is just fine for me. People with medium to large dogs are likely going to be very happy with this purchase."

32979,1,"We have a 13-year-old tabby tomcat who we always had trouble getting to drink water. He's very finicky about food as well, however, the water part of the equation was solved when we got him the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain. We've had one for years and it works perfectly.In fact, when we recently moved from California to Ohio, I had to take the cat on ahead of us to our new hometown by plane, then put him in an upscale pet hotel near the Columbus airport, fly back home the next morning and drive back there with our senior dog and the rest of our family. My wife would call the pet hotel daily to see how the cat was doing, and one thing the staff reported almost immediately that they noticed he wasn't drinking water.Of course! We'd forgotten that he depended on the pet fountain! So I ordered another Drinkwell and had it delivered directly to the pet hotel in his name (I asked the staff ahead of time if that was OK and they said yes). That did the trick! They then reported that he was drinking and doing much better overall.So since our cat endorsing the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain, I do, too. :-)"

160412,0,Wand is weird and bends all the time. The whole thing is a little too heavy. Every now and then I'd accidentally smack our cat in the face with it and normally the toys bounce off and she doesn't mind but this is like hitting her with a brick. She's borderline scared of it. It's an okay product.

187180,2,"BEWARE! I think the older, glowing reviews posted here are about a product that no longer exists. The pet beds I just purchased/received (Feb 2013) are different from the old Quiet Time Pet beds that I bought about five years ago that I was hoping to replace. The old Quiet Time Pet Beds Series 402XX-XX were nice quality, washed up beautifully and were made of COTTON. These new beds have been ""value engineered"", but nothing in the description, pictures nor price has been changed to reflect the downgrade in quality. Not here on Amazon and also not on the manufacturer's site, Midwest Homes for Pets. The phone operator at Midwest told me this change in fabric quality was made over a year ago. SHAME ON MIDWEST! To quote another reviewer, ""Did they think we wouldn't notice?"" (And No, I'm not confused somehow by the knock-off PetCo beds that look very similar, but are of vastly inferior quality.) I would have paid more to maintain the former quality. I'm disappointed. These are going back."
209696,0,"I originally bought the large size of these because according to the description that was correct. But ""large"" was way too small it turned out and the Extra Large does fit well. I then noticed in the reviews that many many others had similar sizing problems.They fit well but sometimes fall off during the night and a few times the tabs which hold them on broke. So they're not reliable.They also are very expensive compared to children's disposable diapers. One reviewer said that she had started using Huggie's Toddler 4-5 instead, cutting a hole for the tail. I tried that and they work much better and are vastly cheaper. However I found that I had to put tape on the edges of hole because if the insides got wet there was a terrible mess.I have since switched to the washable reusable dog diapers which are a lot better but I'm still looking for the idea insert"
57831,0,"...but if you don't have a rx, this is still better than the stuff in the grocery stores. The problem is the dosage is the same for cats of all sizes, which makes no sense.

I recommend this to everyone I talk to. Thank you!
13950,0,"This product works, but has major flaws. First, it doesn't loosen after it tightens when the dog pulls. My poor dog will get her jaw clamped shut by the thing if she does pull or leap ahead and then I have to go and manually give it more slack. While it's a good option if your dog doesn't pull at all while it's on, it doesn't allow the dog to pant which is very important."

I opened the package today and was immediately skeptical because of the appearance, but a few minutes with the cats made a believer out of me. Mika has a very soft, fluffy, medium coat and Kimi has an extremely short, sleek coat. Both cats produced just clouds of shed fur in a very short time with the Zoom Groom, I cannot believe how much hair came off of both of them. The other reviewers were right about letting a bit of fur build up in the teeth to ""grab"" loose hairs, once it got started it did a fine job of keeping the fur trapped instead of scattering it everywhere. I'm now the proud owner of two very contented cats and a giant wad of cat hair, wish I'd bought this sooner."

Also works very nicely on the cats, though a smaller size would be more convenient for them. Relatively expensive, but worth it (and the amazon price was great).

134196,0,"The year before last, Baxter, our cat, was infested with fleas. We chose to treat him with that liquid stuff on his neck. The day after his 3rd dose of the season, he went blind. The Vet said no way did it have anything to do with it -- he must have ate something that was bad and got a bad infection. With antibiotics, his eyesight came back. I know the Vet was probably right, but I am scared to use it again. (Also, the fact that you shouldn't touch him for a while.) I started giving him the Eight In One Brewers Yeast with Omega 3 Fatty Acids and Garlic, ""again"", this time faithfully. This year when the (other) Vet asked me what I was doing for flea control, I told her. She said she personally never had any luck with it. Well, we didn't find a SINGLE flea on him this past Summer!! Oh, and Baxter can't wait to get one in the morning! A real treat! His fur looks healthier, too! Someone said it takes a year for it to get into their system. That may be true!UPDATE July, 2011I have been giving Baxter a pill faithfully everyday. He is approximately 17 lbs. Maybe he needs 1 1/2 pills a day. He has fleas this year. Pretty bad, too. I use a flea comb and dip it in soapy water to kill them. (The vet said Dawn is safe.) I still refuse to use chemicals. He is an older cat."
100993,2,I received the soccer ball at noon time on 9/30. I gave my lab the ball and it was ripped apart by 5 pm. What else needs to be said. I am sending the product back as I write this also on 9/30.
94309,0,"The concept of the brush is fantastic: pull down the bristles and all that remains is the hair in a nice neat package, with absolutely nothing left to clog the bristles on the next brushing. The problem is in the execution. I purchased this brush and a Safari Self-Cleaning Slicker at the same time, for just about the same price since I couldn't tell how each of them works. In fact, the product description on Amazon is IDENTICAL for both: ""With the touch of a button, the pins retract, hair falls away and the pad can be wiped clean. Reposition the button and you're ready to go again."" This description is not accurate for either brush. For the Evolution, you press a button on the side (the red button that the picture on the site shows) and that releases a lever which you pull down, pulling down the pins. That takes at least two digits (e.g., thumb & index). It's easier to just use two hands to do it. Okay, good, pins down, hair comes completely free, and that's great. Now, you want the pins back up, but you can't just push the lever back up because the red button is blocking it - you must reverse the process, pressing the red button, and then moving the lever back, thereby raising the pins.If this were the only brush of this type I had, I would be very happy with it, not knowing any better. However, such is not the case. The Safari's mechanism is far simpler to use. It has a big button on the back (1 inch by 1-1/2 inch). Pushing that button raises the ""floor"" of the brush, effectively withdrawing the pins, and leaving the hair alone on the ""floor"" where, like the Evolution brush, you simply remove ALL the hair you have brushed from your pet. Once you remove the hair, you just let go of the button (which is on a spring). Thus, the descriptions Amazon has on its pages for these two brushes are wrong, or at least very misleading. For the Evolution, the pins don't retract with just ""the touch of a button"" - it requires pressing the button AND moving the lever, nor do you just reposition the button - you press the button and reposition the lever. For the Safari, you do just ""press a [big] button,"" but then you don't really ""reposition"" it, you just let go.So, overall, the Safari brush is far easier to use than the Evolution brush. The Evolution's handle has indentations for the thumb and index finger while the Safari is basically round, fatter at the end than closer to the brush. Despite the fact that the Evolution seems to ""fit"" better, I think I like the feel of the Safari better. The metal bristles on the Evolution are a thicker than on the Safari. I have not noticed any difference in performance because of the thickness, though the thinner bristles on the Safari are of course more likely to get bent, but I don't think that will happen. Because the Evolution draws the bristles inside its body while the Safari simply pushes part of its body above the bristles, there is more plastic in the Evolution brush, and hence it feels a bit more substantial. However, I suspect that both mechanisms will last about the same length of time UNLESS I get so aggravated by the two step process on the Evolution I end up breaking the pin or the lever because I fail to follow the press-the-button, move-the-lever process.The bottom line is the Safari brush is far easier to use: I can't imagine anyone preferring the approach used by the Evolution brush, though some may prefer its feel or think it will last longer than the Safari. However, even if I thought the Safari would not last as long as the Evolution (which I do NOT think) I would still purchase the Safari over the Evolution."
41697,0,"My wife insists that these ""filters"" reduce odor. I think they do reduce odor, but only by a small margin. Maybe 15% or less. My biggest complaint is the cost. These simple carbon stickers are way overpriced, just as the plastic waste recepticles are overpriced. I think a better alternative is to buy a Febreze True Air filter, which lasts a month or longer, and plug it in near the litter box.The carbon filter on the True Air filter is much larger and is active versus passive. As an added bonus, some True Air models come with a nightlight to help kitty see when he/she has to use the box at night. Please reconsider spending money on these cheap carbon stickers. As a final note, I have had no issues with these falling off once applied."

The only problem is, he figured out how to outlast the spray. Once the unit has fully discharged, the dog resumes barking. Not sure how to overcome this. Additionally, the collar has a hard time staying adjusted. I've frequently had to adjust it tighter because the mechanism provided does not hold the position of the collar in place."

189630,0,"I have this pet hammock for almost a year now. I have a 60lb lab. I like the water proof canvas material and it covers the back seat well enough from dirt, debris and fur. It's a too big for my mid-size SUV (I have a rav4) so I have to make adjustments to the front seat clasps.The zipper in between is supposed to be good if you have one backseat passenger, however I find that the because of the zippers, there is a hole in the middle of the hammock that allows some debris to come through into the crevices of my seat. Every time I take the hammock out, I have to clean that crevices. Also, by now, the buttons for the front seat don't snap as well anymore and it kept popping off. and the metal rings for the rear seats have come off from the bungee cords. I never place this hammock to the washing machine, but I find that my dog's fur sticks onto the canvas material, so it's not enough for me to take the hammock out and brush it off, I have to use a vacuum."
179022,0,"My cat is a very picky one. She only uses her litter once and will not use it again until it has been scooped. This was my last option before having to buy a self cleaning little box which is more expensive. My cat would have nothing to do with jumping onto the toilet. She hated it. I adopted my 3 yr old female ragdoll cat 4 months ago.**I moved her littler box to the bathroom. She used that for a while just fine.**Then I replaced the box with the actual toilet insert that was filled with her regular litter. She used it.**I put the toilet insert on the toilet. She refused to jump onto the toilet seat to use it. I had not even cut any holes in it. She continuously ""pottied"" on the bathroom floor.**I moved the toilet insert back to the floor. She used it.**Tried moving it back to the toilet and she pottied on the floor again.Every cat is different. You are not going to know if this product works for your cat or not until you try it. It seems to work for many cats. My father had a cat that was potty trained when I was a little girl and I know it is possible and even doable without a handy tool like this one, but for my cat she wanted nothing to do with it. We bought the self cleaning littler box."
107845,2,Overall the material is good but it was no match for my dogs. I have a 8 month old German Shephard and a 4 year old Boston Terrier. My German Shephard got a hold of the frisbee first and ripped the edge off. I figured this product would be much harder for my dogs to tear up than other toys but that is just not the case. I am dissappointed that it lasted less than a day when it was implied that it would last much longer.
69154,0,"I purchased this item to protect the back seat of my toyota corolla from my labrador mix. It works well to protect the seat, and also keeps him from falling forward, but my one issue is that the material the straps are made of is quite low quality. The design is that four straps fit over the headrests of the front and back seats. One of these straps just snapped as I was trying to cinch it to make it shorter. If the straps were made of sturdy nylon webbing, it would be a much better product. Otherwise, it does keep the seat clean and dry, although some hair and sand or dirt will collect towards the back of the hammock and can fall through the slits where the seatbelts come through. Velcro slits would be nice."
113451,2,"First and foremost, I understand I was buying a smaller pet bed. It was intended to put in a crate, with a puppy panel and I would get a larger one as the puppy grew. I measured the crate and decided 22"" x 13"" would be about the right size for now. The bed arrives and it's tiny. As My jaw dropped I reached for the tape measurer. It's maybe 20""x12"". Thinking maybe I read everything wrong, I went back and read what I purchased. To make matters worse the description in the product details states 26.8"" x 22"" x 10"". What? I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'd really be curious as to how they came up with those. It's not close to those nor the 22x13 and I tried every way to stretch the bed to give Midwest the benefit of the doubt.Secondly, the quality is pretty average at best, but then again, you get what you pay for. I learned that after the Midwest lifestages crate came a few days ago and it was equally as bad. There's a reason this thing is so cheap. It's small and I can see this thing falling apart in about a month or two. I would have given it 1 star, but I think I need to add a star because my expectations should have been different for $11."
92266,2,I had high hopes for this toy given the many positive reviews but my 3 cats got bored with this toy in less than an hour. The toy itself is well made and seems very safe but I guess mileage will vary depending on your cats.

It doesn't pull out the hair that's attached...like some other brushes I've tried. Cadie and Duke just love the attention. Sometimes makes me wish I was the dog!

To my disappointment it lasted a whole 5 minutes before she had chewed the bone in half and chewed off small pieces of rubber. She was very proud of herself. Definitely not for dogs who love to chew. However when I contacted Planet Dog about the toy they provided some exceptional customer service and some better options for our dog. I would try other products from them based on their customer service and attentiveness to their customers.

I had read all the BAD reviews on this item but like an idiot thought maybe mine would work better LOL, nope!!! But dont worry if it stops working you can buy a replacment diaphram kit at about $7 to $8 dollars a pop. So if you buy this item plan to spend around $16 dollars plus shipping a month to fix it every two weeks, or just save your money, you will be better off trust me!! Bottom line... ITS JUNK!!"

49461,0,"The flea comb works like it should, except with the double rows of teeth it's harder to get the comb through my cats fur. I have one fluffy cat and one slick cat and it's impossible to use on the short hair cat because I can't get the comb to lift up his fur. It works okay on the fluffy one.I don't see any benefit to having a double row of teeth."
195772,2,"I am at fault for not reading more of the reviews for this item before I purchased them. I loved the photos of these cat toys; the colors were bright and cheerful and the springs 'looked springy and fun'. I admit I stopped reading after reading just a few reviews about how much other people's cats loved these toys. The springs sounded exactly like something my two cats would be in love with.Now I now don't know if they would like them or not because I would never let them play with them. The are way too stiff for even me to 'spring' them. The colors are very unattractive. The paint looks ugly and smells horrid. They are very hard metal with extremely sharp and painful pointed ends on each end that could stab a paw or tongue or spring into an eye or other body part and could really injure you if you accidentally stepped on one. The photo is entirely misleading. Now, finally reading reviews after the fact, I read that this toy indeed 'used' to actually be like it looks in the photos; bright, cheery, soft plastic, springy. etc.If you love your cats and your cats love to have fun with interactive, but safe, toys, I would not recommend buying these. I am not at all interested in reporting whether my pets like them or not; I love my two cats way too much to let them get their little paws on even one of these dangerous springs.Wouldn't pay to send them back, but definitely won't use them or, heaven forbid, ever order anymore.EDIT: Additional information on these springs - added 01/09/2012:I contacted Amazon directly about these dangerous springs. They have processed a refund for the cost of the springs (I didn't pay original s/h; the springs were part of a Super Saver Order). They also provided me with information about Ethical (phone #, fax #, e-mail, etc) so that I could contact them directly about whether the springs were still being made with plastic or have been changed to metal. Frankly, I think it is obvious that the metak springs many of us received were not related to Ethical; the Ethical name was not mentioned on the product I received. It appears to me the seller is simply misrepresenting what the item he is offering for sale.I would urge every customer who ordered these dangerous springs offered for sale as 'Ethical Springs' to contact Amazon directly and ask to receive a refund for the misrepresented product.Based on this episode, plus another episode with misrepresentation of the condition of a book ordered from a marketplace seller, it has become clear to me that Amazon is placing themselves squarely is the middle by not holding their third-party and marketplace sellers to a higher standard. Amazon is providing their (at this point) positive name recognition to other sellers (of both types) and is bearing the weight of having their customer-service representatives spend an enormous amount of time dealing with unhappy customers, and in many cases is provided promo credits or refunds for products - but they are not following-thru with the third-party sellers and marketplace sellers to hold them responsible for honesty in selling. At least that is how it looks to me as a customer.I have been an avid and dedicated customer of Amazon at all levels for many years, but after multiple problems this November and December; I am currently re-evaluating my future as a loyal Amazon Customer. Including this misrepresentation with the cat springs, I have spent way too much time dealing with Amazon customer-service through phone calls and e-mails to try to get correct products, owed credits, adequate service, and final resolutions. I am now evaluating whether the savings is worth my time in the long run. I will however state that in the end all my problems have been resolved and credits given, but one has to wonder; how long can Amazon continue to bear the brunt of the fall out of misconduct and misrepresentation by 'outside' sellers? Amazon of course is in control of the answer to that question and ultimately, hopefully, will make the correct decision for them as a business.From the outside looking in; right now Amazon is seriously beginning to look a lot like Netflix when it comes to presenting themselves as a major booming successful business venture demonstrating just how to go about shooting themselves in the foot.Perhaps customers requesting Amazon to make refunds on misrepresented items, such as this dangerous cat toy, will help Amazon make a decision on their future dealings with outside sellers that will ultimately be advantageous to both Amazon and their customers."
108710,1,"Last night some friends of mine came over for dinner and gave my cats this toy. Normally I don't pay much mind to cat toys, since the cats may love them at first and then ignore them, with few exceptions. This toy provided hours of entertainment last night, both with the mouse inside and outside the ball.I have one dominant cat and one less dominant cat, they studied the toy for a while, and then the dominant one went after it. Took the less dominant one some time but she went after it too. They LOVED it. We put the toy away for a bit and turned it back on after dinner and they went after it again, for a long time. Playing, watching, stalking, looking pleased with themselves while we laughed and watched them like they were the Discovery channel. So fun!Some things to consider -I have rechargeable AAA batteries on hand, which I would recommend. If your cats have as much fun as mine did, you'll go through batteries pretty quickly. I'll make sure to always have a charged one on hand.I do have carpet. It is low carpet so when the mouse was in the ball with a fresh battery it booked around the house. When it was on the carpet it was slower, and even though I had just vacuumed, a little bit of hair got caught around one of the wheels, slowing it down, which I gently removed. If you have thick carpet, this toy will probably not be as fun. Hard floors, rock on!This toy did not get stuck, when it stopped, it just waggled and waggled until it got itself free.There is also a small screw that keeps the battery compartment/motor inside the mouse and I did not screw it all the way when putting in the battery, so it came loose and I lost it. The motor still snaps inside the mouse and stays, but I found an extra little screw since the cats love this toy and love to play hard with it when it is out of the ball. Make sure you tighten it completely.If you have only one cat and it is a scaredy cat, it may not like this toy. My less dominant cat who will run under the bed when she's afraid got over her fear because her sister was prancing around stalking it, but some other cats that are alone may never get into it. Or they may love it!I want to buy this toy for all my friends with cats. It is so much fun. Enjoy!"
181480,1,"We've only used this bed for one night, but the cats seem to love it. I contacted K&H to ask some questions about the product, and the customer service was great; the rep was very helpful, addressed my questions, and even returned my call the same day."
61361,2,"Despite reading all of the bad reviews my husband and I decided to give the LitterMaid Elite a chance. We are a two cat household and I thought it would be so nice to have a little litter box duty relief. And it would have been, had the littermaid actually worked at all.Just like the reviews above stated the rake simply is non functional. The very first time our cat pooped in it the rake was unable to push it up into the waste receptacle. We tried everything. We put less litter in, then we tried filling the litter box up more (which did improve the success rate to about 50% mind you). Also, we noticed our sensors were not detecting the cats every time they went in it. So half the time the thing didn't even attempt to scoop it.This product really is a piece of overpriced trash. They obviously did not do any sort of consumer testing before putting the new ""elite"" model on the market. Or maybe they did and just didn't care.Thankfully Petsmart has a very generous return policy. We were able to take it back."

28142,1,"We have pets that sometimes get frightened when left alone. This stuff not only gets the smell out, but it gets the discoloration out too. It works on vomit, food, pee, poop, everything! We use it on almost any stain - whether it was from a pet, child, or whatever. We love the stuff. We have tried many different brands and product types. This is by far the best. The smell is strong, but we are so happy with its effectiveness that it is a small, and very temporary, price to pay."
109273,0,"My youngest Miniature Schnauzer is very ball driven. He loves tennis balls , not just and this ball has become his favorite toy. Not only does it have that Tennis Ball feel to it but it squeaks to his amusement... not his owners amusement.The squeak is rather high pitched so after a while of him playing with this thing I had to replace it with a real tennis ball. A real tennis ball is rather thick, has the rubber inside to it and can't be punctured.This toy tennis ball is made out of material which isn't very durable and even though my dog has not yet done it I can see if you have a dog who is a chewer this toy will be destroyed.Final conclusion with this is it's fun for a while but not something I want my dog to play with all the time and definitely not unsupervised."

197565,1,"I used these when my cat had to take antibiotic pills for an upper respiratory infection. They worked well, but I learned a couple of things:1. Feed him the pill pockets alone a couple of times.2. VERY IMPORTANT - Use one hand for the pill and the other for the pocket, and never let them touch. I accidentally let the pill hand touch the pocket and he wouldn't eat it because he smelled the pill.The pill pockets were much easier than trying to pill and then squirt water into the cat."
8894,2,"The gate looks great and is made of good quality wood, but my dog figured out how to push her way out in minutes."
175614,1,"My cat figured out how to defeat Pill Pockets after about 3 days. I tried Flavor Doh which worked ok for another couple of days. Then I ordered the Pet Piller. It looks and feels flimsy, but I don't consider this a problem, since it isn't stressed in any way during the pilling process.I was unable to used it at first, when I followed the directions that were included. Then I went to trusty You Tube. First I watched a video from a vet who held his cat's head back, dropped in the pill, and then spit into the cat's mouth to make it swallow! Gross. Next was an entertaining satire about how difficult it is to pill cats. Finally I found one (sorry I can't find it again now) that showed the correct method: hold the cat's head from behind with left hand (assuming right-handedness: reverse for lefties), (*) insert the piller tip into the cat's mouth from the side and a bit toward the back, tipped downward somewhat, so it is aimed directly at the back of the throat, and quickly shoot the pill in and hold the cat's mouth to insure the pill is swallowed.(*) the entire action from (*) to the end of the paragraph should take no longer than one second.If you do it correctly, the pill is swallowed instantly and you really don't need to hold her mouth closed. It was so easy that I didn't believe it at first and waited to see the pill get spit back out. The next day I failed the first time, but the second time worked. Since then I have not had a problem, AND my cat is so much less freaked out by the process.Happy pilling."
13995,0,"Wanted this for my pup who stays in the crate for a few hours and wanted them to have water. When it arrived, it looks sturdy and looked like it would work well. I followed the directions that were supplied to the tee, hoping to avoid the problems that others had complained about. Didn't work properly, attached well to the metal crate, but had a constant drip. So much that in an hour there was more of a mess with a wet dog, than the convenience. I might as well put the bowl of water directly in the cage. Tried a few times to 'start over' letting it dry out and follow the instructions again.....it is sitting in the garage now wasting space (and my money) I wish they could come up with a better design."
214035,1,"My cat had feline acne on her chin and nose before and I have always used Oxydex to clear it up. It looked like it spread to the area around her eye, even causing a small amount of hair loss. Since you have to avoid using Oxydex shampoo around your pet's eyes, I had to find some other product that was safe to be applied in and around her eyes. I purchased this Halo product, as well as the Vetericyn, suspecting it to be either acne or some kind of bacteria/ fungus growth. I first used Vetericyn to topically wipe her eyes for about 3 days, but nothing really changed or improved.I then tried the Halo wash (only the first step- Eyebright Extract mixture). The package came with two tiny vials of concentrated solution for a multi-step treatment process, which you have to mix with distilled water (or spring or filtered water- boiled and then cooled). Even though the vials are small, I think it would make a lot of solution. After mixing the Eyebright solution and using it about 2 days (only topically), I could see a noticeable improvement right away. I have since gone to my vet and she said that she could not see any problems around her eye. The hair has even grown back. Her eyes look great now.I have not tried the second step of the treatment (goldenseal), so I cannot review it here. I also did not drop the solution directly into her eyes, so I cannot review that aspect here either.You do have to store the product in the fridge, since there are no preservatives, but the box is small and takes up only a small amount of space.Thank you for offering a great product to help my kitty's eyes."

I would recommend you buy the smallest bottle first to see if your dog will tolerate the taste/smell before spending more money needlessly on a larger bottle. We have discontinued giving him the product. Does anyone out there have ideas on how to mask the taste for dogs who eat dry food?"
79600,0,"My cats go outdoors and we go for walks, so we always have our own adventures. The mother cat of my four kittens watches it the most, she was born in the wild and fears people but she watches the movie, it puts them to sleep or they would rather nap, perhaps it is more for cat or dog shut-ins. They watch Sunrise Earth, on the discovery channel too, but only like intermittently, not with all their attention. Maybe they have ADD, maybe it's the catnip. The movie is very entertaining to me, I love watching it, I wish it had more cats. I'd like to see cats stalking and killing their prey. That is something that would rally grab my kitties attention."
204391,0,"I chose to buy this product again 10 years later because my first tent crate is still in use without any problems with frame, fabric or zipper. The new portable crate has a base that made different & it remains to be seen if it will give great service like its predecessor."
71453,0,"I tried Program, but I have an indoor/outdoor cat. There are three or four other cats in the immediate vicinity. If I use Program, which only kills eggs, it doesn't help my cat, because she brings in fleas from outside, which then jump/fall onto my wood floor, reproduce in the cracks, and jump on my cat as she skitters around trying to avoid ""floor crack flea babies"". Program may well kill the fleas that reproduce on the cat, but it doesn't kill the ones that reproduce elsewhere and then jump on her. If you have an indoor/outdoor cat and do not care to constantly vacuum your house, Program may not be the best choice for your cat.So even though my 17-year-old diabetic cat has had an averse reaction to Advantage once, it works better for her. I now put less than a full dose of Advantage each time I apply it, and the side effects appear to be milder. The cat feels somewhat ill the first day after applying Advantage - it is a poison that goes into her system - but then the biting stops and she feels so much better within a day. I use Advantage during the summer/fall infestation time, usually from July through October, and somehow the rest of the year, there aren't so many fleas. This year, 2011, seemed to be particularly bad. I'm not sure whether that's because I did not use Advantage because I was worried it would damage my cat - or perhaps because there was more rain this year."

151369,2,"The problem with this product is that a smart and motivated cat (such as ours, apparently) can stick its paw up the delivery chute and wiggle the auger, causing a slow but endless trickle of kibble. We tried larger cat kibble, to no avail. If the auger was longer or a tighter fit in the passage, or there was less wiggle room in the mechanism, that might help. Once we noticed that the cat was feeding at all hours and not just when the feeder was scheduled to deliver kibble, I tried wiggling my finger inside the delivery chute and sure enough, a few bits of kibble were released with each wiggle, and this goes on indefinitely. This product might work for a cat that is less obsessed with food than ours, but it is annoying that at this price the mechanics can be by-passed by a cat's paw."

My only regret is the expense, and the unavailability of a bulk order or multipack. That is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.

It definitely should not be labeled a ""heater"". It seems to do nothing at all if I turn off the heater in the room and let the temp go below 75 in there.HOW does this thing have such a good rating???

147845,2,"The quality of this product has significantly declined. My cat's been happily playing w/ Da Bird feather toys for years, but the last two I've bought quickly fell apart. The last one fell apart in three different ways: first, the string kept coming untied from the feather attachment - I had to reknot it and then fix the knot with superglue. Then the two halves of the pole kept falling apart - superglue fixed that one too, though of course the toy could then no longer be dismantled for storage. No matter. But then the hardware of the feather attachment itself broke in two - that's the part that holds the feathers together and attaches them to the clip that the string gets tied to. And superglue couldn't fix this one. And all of this happened only about a week after I got the toy, and it was not abused in any way, just subjected to normal play. I conclude that the company that makes Da Bird has started seriously cutting corners to save on production costs. And of course they want us to buy new toys more frequently. Enough. My cat will have to play with something else."

I've literally seen him destroy a tennis ball in 10 minutes.He likes these as well as ""normal"" tennis balls, but they will usually last us through several play sessions before he cracks them. And, even once they are cracked, the felt will sometimes take a couple of more days before it is destroyed, meaning that I can sometimes get a week out of one of these balls. Not great, but much better than the regular tennis balls.If you are looking for a ball that cannot be destroyed, look further because this is NOT it.

37650,2,"We have used this for a few months now, and I am reasonably pleased with it. I read dozens of reviews on Amazon, and gleaned a bunch of useful tips regarding, for example, the clips, which some complained were easy to break. Ensuring careful alignment of the 4 clips is vital before you lock them into place.We have six cats, including a 15 lb Havana Brown, and use four litter trays with inexpensive (Big Lots), unperfumed, $4.00 per 14lb jug, of clumping litter. All cats took to this tray immediately.. novelty, mebbe! After a few weeks they are using all covered trays equally.The first time I rolled the box, I had urine seep out on to the wood floor. To be fair, this only happened once. I do have one boy who wees standing up, and although the urine does not leak out of the ""join"" between upper and lower, I do have to remove the lid most days and clean down the sides of the box, and along the join, as I do with all of them anyway. The same cat will occasionally turn around and wee through the entrance from time to time, which is why I will also recommend the PetFusion Smart Grip Litter Mat (see my review) from Amazon:PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat (Gray and White)This mat is such a good product that I ended getting four of them!Probably my main gripe with this litter box is that it is too short from front to back.. my large Havana Brown can get in and then has a heck of a job turning around and positioning himself to use it comfortably. Sometimes he will give up and head for another box. The toileting compartment IS considerably smaller than my other litter boxes.Also, my cats DO sometimes wee on the grid, and yes, it will smell after a day or two! And yes, it's a bugger to clean! When this has happened, I have removed the litter, dismantled the box, and used the hose to wash it down thoroughly before drying and re-assembling it. I have done this twice so far, and it is fairly time-consuming. When the cold weather hits, this will be an impossible task.. and no, I refuse to wash it down in the spa tub (the only receptable large enough for this box!).This is how I personally perform the empty:Roll the box to the right until it is almost on its side. The unused litter can be seen/heard passing through the grid and the clumps and poo will move beyond the grid (mostly.. small ones from my petite Siamese girl DO sometimes get through with the clean litter). At this time, I peer into the box and check to see if any clumps have stuck to the sides or floor of the tray. If they have, then I whack the outside with my hand to loosen them. I then complete the movement, slowly turning the tray on to its roof. I wait until the movement of litter has stopped and start to rotate it back to the left, gently. By doing everything slowly, it avoids the clumps breaking up before they get to the colection receptacle. When around 50% of the litter has moved back into the ""cubicle"" area, then I remove the receptacle and empty it into a plastic bag (those thin grey Walmart plastic carrier bags are the best as they generally don't have any holes in them) before moving on to my next litter box. I replace the receptacle and tilt the box to the left, holding it, until most of the clean litter has moved back into the cubicle area. I then place the box level and use a scoop to level the surface.UPDATE: It has been several months and I really am fed up with the high maintenance of this litter box. I DO find it messy and it has gotten very smelly. I have hosed it down outside and it still has a uriney smell. I will not be able to do this in winter of course! None of my other hooded boxes have given me a smell problem.. and the oldest is still going after 6 years. I am replacing it with another of the two I bought recently off E-Bay that are a doddle to move around with four side clips and a handy carrying handle."
183274,2,"Well, maybe 3 minutes. I read the reviews and was sure this toy would at least a couple of weeks. I was a couple of weeks off. I gave it to my 50 lb. lab mix. She took it and ran into the next room. I was distracted for a couple of minutes, then followed her into the room to see if she liked her new toy. In that short amount of time she had completely ripped it to shreds. I'm giving it two stars because I got a good laugh out of it."
191122,1,I have been trying all kinds of dog food to get my pick little chihuahua to eat something nutritious. Nothing was working. Then I discovered Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Chicken Patties and HE BLEW THROUGH THEM!!!I think we have a winner here! I am going to order some of the other flavors to give him some variety. Hope he likes them as well.

14895,2,"I have 3 rescues that I am, to say the least, obsessed about. Switched to this from frontline after finding a few fleas on my pups not realizing that that is normal i.e. fleas have to feed to be killed. Anyhow after my first application of this my one pet chi started having a pesticide-like (cholinergic) reaction with panting, anxiety, pacing, drooling, whining and diarrhea. I was freaking out b/c I thought he was going to have a seizure (that comes next). I started reading online and there are literally forums criticizing this as unsafe i.e. the flea repellant properties work great but NUMEROUS pets have had these SEVERE reactions which are nothing to joke about or take lightly. I have nothing against Bayer and respect their other products but this one, like HARTZ products, should be banned. My solution FYI - I hesitated trying an oral regimen (why would I want my dogs to consume a pesticide) but I trust my vet so I reluctantly tried them on Trifexis (Spinosid is main ingredient) and all of them tolerate it absolutely side effect free and have seen ZERO fleas after 5 months. It may not be your dogs solution but I would be super cautious proceeding with the use of this product."
141485,2,"I purchased the Lucky Dog 5 x 15 foot weatherguard Kennel Roof System less than a year ago from Atwoods and the tarp is disintegrating. It is shedding small silver flakes all over the place and has developed a large tear. This cover is in an open area that is not exposed to falling limbs or excessive pine straw, just a lot of hot Arkansas sun. I am very disappointed in this tarp because I have car covers, boat covers, motorcycle covers, propane grill covers, etc. that are several years old and they are holding up fine. This tarp didn't even last a year. I like the kennel, it wasn't to difficult to put together and it gives you the option of 5 x 15 feet or 10 x 10 feet. But I do not recommend this cover. You can purchase a much cheaper tarp that will hold up for several years."
41423,0,"I had used Virbac Epi-Otic prior to purchasing this product. the Epi-Otic is a single cleaning fluid that self drys. this Otifoam, on the otherhand, requires not only the foaming cleanser, but also the DVM's OtiRinse as well (which I didn't know at the time I purchased this, which is why I've rated this product as 3 stars). So, long story short, I'm still using the Epi-Otic and this OtiFoam is still in it's plastic wrap. I might pickup some of the OtiRinse If I ever run out of Epi-Otic, but then again, I really prefer a single liquid application of Epi-Otic, which works well (and I'm sure my dogs apreceate a single dose liquid too!). Hope this helps!"
60144,1,Frontline is the only product we have ever used on our dogs. We've lived in a rural area for about 3 years and neither dog ever had even a single flea or tick. Great product that I highly recommend.
116613,0,"These were linked with the Waggle -- there may even be a photo of the toy on the front of the treat bag.I'm still using these, just to get rid of them, but when used with the small Waggle they provide no challenge for my 12-pound mix. They're too small and fall right out with almost no effort on her part, which -- I want her occupied! The pieces are also too small to be used as treats; each is about the size of a small pill or long grain of rice. To keep the pieces from falling out immediately, I usually seal the opening of the Waggle with peanut butter before I give her the toy.The chicken flavoring grosses me out; it reminds me a little of cereal ""icing"" the way it coats each piece.Regardless, I'm not disappointed in the product per se, we're still using it, and my dog has no complaints."
167707,0,Read the info on the Doggie Dooley website. If your ground does not perk well (drain) don't bother with this because it will stink to high Heaven. Other than than it is easy to install and maintain but our ground is not suitable for this item. I had to pull it out due to smell and flies.
93558,2,"I can't comment about the product itself but can tell you that the customer service on this product is not good. I mistakenly ordered the product twice and needed to cancel one of them, and tried repeatedly to call the company. NO ONE answered the phone for the returns or existing order department. Honestly, I hung on for almost an hour. When I tried calling sales, I finally reached someone but they quickly transferred me back to no man's land. I called back AGAIN and the person told me that maybe that department was ""out to lunch."" I called back AGAIN to sales and finally got a nice man to help me cancel one of the orders. This was honestly and all day affair. I hope the product that does come is worth it, if it comes!"
52918,0,"I bought this for my dog's trek overseas. Great concept, but not as durable as I hoped.

124063,0,I have two of these and my dogs (3 small) love them. I ordered the chocolate snooZZy and it does not seem as bigas the other two which are what I measured off of to order this one. They still lay on it but hang off alittle.These are so soft and wash up really well. Amazon offered the best price.
164813,0,Our Miniature Schnauzers are between 19-23 pounds and the medium sized is NOT large enough at all. The dogs nose needs to be within the cone to prevent licking. These aren't that sturdy either. I recommend clear cones from the vets.
166222,0,this product is ok my dogs still have fleas and so like I said its ok I cant believe its not great
51654,0,"This leash is very sturdy and well-made EXCEPT for the reflective material. It began to peel off the handle during the 1st use. Within a month less than half remained and I finally peeled the rest off because it was making a mess. I am here to buy another one because it finally tore up after 2 years of very heavy use by my large, rambunctious, water-loving lab. I can't find another leash like it so I'm just going to get another one and plan to peel the reflective material off sooner this time."
196616,0,"Overall, it works. But, our house is standard 2 x 6 construction w/1/2"" Drywall, 5-1/2"" studs, 5/8"" ext sheathing and 3/4"" ext siding = 7-3/8"". This product accomodates 7-1/4"" wall. I have a 1/8 gap between the telescoping walls. The plastic telescoping walls are too thin and not long enough to overlap each other. The holes in the frame for the screws are too close to the cut-out and need to be farther away for a secure install. You will need to install a 2x8 at the bottom cut-out where the animals may step. Especially for large dogs. Make sure the top of the cut-out is 1-2"" above the height of your dogs back to accomodate the bend in the flap as the dog goes through."
216822,1,"I have used this product as a rotational supplement. Since the smell is so different from other supplements, I started my dogs out with the smallest pinch and extremely slowly upped the dose. By only putting the tiniest amount in their food, they slowly adjusted to the aroma of it and finally learned to look forward to it. I think people want to add in too much to start and then the dog turns up their nose. By putting in a small pinch to start, you get the dog's nose used to the aroma over time. I don't let my dogs force me into not serving them new things. They have no choice but to get used to it, and they always do. I have 6 dogs now and 5 different breeds. They all eat it with no complaint. Before this I had a few other breeds and they, too, always ate it. That is because I allow the time for adjustment to it. It is worth the time spent to teach your dog this is a good food additive."
164516,2,". . .because I ordered two of these 8 months or so ago, and they were never sent. I'm sure they're lovely if you can get the seller to actually send them to you."
44435,2,"We have had this for several months, and often when we refill the tank it apparently doesn't get seated correctly and the water runs out all at once. The worst part is that it happens slowly (overnight), and we can't find where it runs out of the base. So it is not until we wait an hour or so before we know if it is seated or not. There are no rubber seals or springs to help prevent this.It runs very quietly at first until the filter starts to get clogged with cat hair or saliva, rinsing provides some short time relief but it can be a good indicator that it is time to change it. The motor runs fine after 6 months, with infrequent cleaning."
136077,0,"Because these collars are round, they're reflective from every angle, which is great. And when I say ""reflective"", I mean reallyREALLY reflective, which is also great. The reflective tape is woven through the whole collar, and there's lots of it, so it really picks up the light when I'm out walking my dogs at night.I would've given them a perfect rating, except for the fact that the collars are a lot bigger than they're supposed to be. The size is stated as 19""-24"", but even when it's buckled at the tightest notch, the collar is still a little over 27"", which is so big that they can slide easily over the heads of my two 75-lb Golden Retrievers. So it's a great collar for night-safety purposes, but really bad for dog-restraint purposes.The collars so inexpensive that it didn't seem worth the trouble to return them, so when I take the dogs out at night, I just slip the reflective collars on along with their regular collars, kind of like a necklace rather than a dog collar, which actually works pretty well. So overall, I'd recommend the collars pretty highly - just order a size a lot smaller than you think you'll need, or plan to use it mainly as a decorative accessory."
185105,1,"We use this inside of our 7yr old's bed. The bed is very large, but the warmer is the right size for her - 70lb Boxer. She is getting older and it's getting more difficult for her to get out of bed in the mornings. She loves laying on this and is already more mobile just after a week. Our 1yr old also likes to lay on this when our older lady is out of bed."
23118,1,"Hasn't stopped shedding completely, but hopefully will prevent furballs--which is what I was more concerned about.I have 2 short haired cats and have managed a few 5-10 minute sessions with this tool resulting in golf-ball sized fur balls. Definitely does what it says."
42594,0,"I originally bought this for my puppy to ride with me in the car. The problem is it doesn't work with my console. My Console butterflies out and I couldn't attach it to my console. It also sits high and doesn't provide shade. My puppy avoids the sun. If your puppy/dog likes the sun and you have a standard console, then this might be the product for you."
113414,1,"This bed is the perfect size for my 25 lb. shelter rescue. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the family room, either. I like the natural color. I also bought one for my upstairs computer room. He enjoys both. I like that the sides aren't too high so he can hang over the edge. And, yet it's not just a flat blanket. It's an actual bed and has a shape. I wish they made this in the exact same width except about 18-19"" long, so I can put two side-by-side on the backseat of my car. Oh, well."
152002,0,We like the collar for it's purpose. The handle is a great feature! Our dog seems to have springs on her feet. So being able to hold on to something besides her collar herself and choking her is wonderful. BUT! The appearance isn't holding up. The plastic tag inside for her information has worn off completely and just like some of the other reviews... yes it frays. This is an expensive collar for how often it will need replaced in the future.I'm 50/50.
54227,2,"This product looks like it would be very durable but it falls apart very quickly. I got the small/medium for my 15 lb Westie and she has absolutely destroyed it...taken chunks out of the plastic/pulled out all the bristles. Even with taking it away after a few mins, it only last maybe 3 uses. I also bought the large for my 72lb German Shepherd and she just acts like she doesn't know what to do with it. She just carries it around and licks off the toothpaste. I thought this was a really good idea but it really will depend on if your dog uses it in a way to make it actually clean their teeth."
184415,0,"The fence transmitter and receiver collar work just as well as the expensive ones that the pet containment companies would like to sell you. But watch out for the light guage antenna wire that comes with this kit. I've had 3 problems with the wire:- Stapling the twisted pairs to the side of my house - the flat staples cut right through the insulation and shorted the antenna loop. Took a while to track that down.- Easy to break. Above ground stretches of the wire (along a fence) have broken twice.- Apparent high impedance - the transmitter chirps intermittently because it thinks there's a break in the wire when there isn't. I suspect this is just the impedance from 1000 feet of tiny wire.I plan to buy a roll of heavier wire at the hardware store and replace the antenna entirely.Follow Up (Dec 2009): I found 14 ga solid core copper wire at the local home center for a reasonable price, and used it to replace the wire that came with kit. That seemed to fix the problem. I later had to buy a new transmitter after a lightning strike fried the original, but I know from experience that the this happens to the expensive dog fences just as often."
97075,1,"I had used Greenies for my dogs a few years ago and was concerned about them being a choking or swallowing (whole) hazard.I was just at my Vet's today and she said she didn't USE TO recommend Greenies, but the company changed the formula and now she does.The NEW formula breaks into bits as the dog chews, and is also more digestible. If the dog happened to swallow the whole Greenie, it WOULD dissolve in the stomach just fine.HOWEVER, as my Vet cautioned, get the RIGHT SIZE Greenie for your dog, so that if doggie does swallow it, it won't present a blockage risk.My only complaint with this product is that they don't last long, as my little guy gobbles it up frantically..."
129183,1,"I've tried various devices to carry ""poop"" bags with me as I walk but by far this is the one I'm loving. It fits snug and looks bulky but doesn't get in the way of the handle or the lock button. It can hold a lot of stuff and is well made. Time will tell how well it wears over the long haul but I have high hopes for still using it in 5 years."
73486,2,These liners do not fit properly. There is no way to properly secure them and keep litter from falling into the litter box. They also rip easily.
138817,2,"I ordered this after trying to find a crate that was taller and shorter for my toy poodle. He has a long neck and we are going overseas. He needs a taller kennel, not a longer kennel. In any case, that product doesn't exist so I finally gave up and ordered this kennel.There is no carry handle attached to this kennel at all. I realize this is a product defect and that I can contact Amazon and return the kennel. However, that leaves me out in the air without a kennel to use when we fly as there isn't enough time now to reorder another kennel.This attests to the inferior workmanship of the Petmate kennels. They used to be wonderful crates when the company was Doskocil. They also had a great little 16 inch tall kennel that worked great for toy poodles. The material wasn't as thin and the workmanship was much better.I won't be ordering another Petmate kennel."

168389,0,"I can't remember exactly how long ago I purchased 4 of these, but it's been about a year. Certainly less than 2 years. They are not cheap! So the cost of 4 is a significant expense. I find that they do work well if you can get them aimed correctly so as to discourage the cats but not scare yourself to death by setting it off accidentally. The sound alone is all that's needed, really. The hissing spray will not only scare the perpetrator, but clear the entire room of every cat in it. The problem is that the motion activation sensors have stopped working on all but 3 of the cans. I changed out batteries and tested them in turn. One will work every now and then, 2 are completely dead, 1 still works. I've ordered 3 more because I can't find a good alternative ..."
18762,2,"Maybe it was my own fault for ordering this-- but my 28lb beagle destroyed this toy in about 35 seconds. Itsy bitsy, about the size of the squeaker inside of it. Seemed more like a cat toy to me."
150167,2,"I have had two of these. I really liked the way it feels in my hand, and the fact that it is electric. It is much nicer than the Oster electric nail grinder, and I think it is a little bit more quiet. I bought this because the Dremel cordless only lasts me through maybe 3 dogs at my salon before I have to switch out and recharge, and sometimes only lasts me through one nail grind on a large breed, for ex a Mastiff-VERY inconvenient and inefficient, a problem that was solved by using an electric grinder. Unfortunately, the Master Grooming Tools nail grinder has a faulty resistor. My first one I had for a little under a year before it started getting sluggish and turning off at random. A week after the symptoms, it died. I didn't save the receipt, stupidly, because there is a one yr warranty (Which doesn't cover ""normal wear and tear"" btw, and they would have classified my problem under that according to the service rep I spoke to after the fact). Well, I bought a second one in January, and the first week of March I took it out to use and it just didn't turn on- no signs of dying this time. I called the company I ordered it from to ask if I could just exchange this for the cordless Dremel, and they were nice enough to do so. Refunded me my money, told me to keep it (instead of sending it back and having to pay shipping on that) and then sent me the Dremel, free of service charge. (Kudos Petedge for great customer service!)While I still prefer this electric grinder over the cordless Dremel, I can't be out a tool for a week or two at a time. My handyman took my two broken Master Grooming Tools apart and the resistor was completely fryed (oddly, on my new one) and dislodged on my older one. Good thing that came out of this- he just reconnected the resistor on my older one and it works again- for how long, we shall see."

148465,0,"We have 2 small dogs and have broken them to the pads. I am not sure about this product, maybe if I had purchased the trays to put them in it might be better. What I found was they have a tendency to feel damp on the bottom. This is not what you want in wee wee pads."
185838,0,"I was reading up on being a good cat mommy and all around fur person and have learned that a busy, interested cat lives in good harmony with his housemates and tends to do less damage in the house with the idea being that the kitty: Plays, Hunts, Eats and Sleeps. And though we see our kitty asleep as we walk in from work, we know by the looks of the house that activity has taken place while we were gone, and it is not always good activity. So, I got ""Dah Bird""...well, three of them, and Cat Dancer...2 of them and various other toys, but these require a lot of work on my part and after a long day at work, I can get kind of frazzled playing with Dah Bird for an hour.So, I went looking for automated toys, or toys that might keep my guys busy for a while.So I ordered Peek a Prize Pet Toy Box. First, I sprayed it down with Cat Nip Spray and settled to let that dry. My two kitties came running to see what the spray was going on. They looked at the box, but were not too interested in the empty box. But I was not worried. I loaded the box up with some treats and some fun toys and waited to see if they would retun to play. I put it right in the middle of their walk way so thay HAD to see it. No interest. So I got down on the floor and showed them how to knock the balls out, or how to bat them in the box. No dice. This thing sat in the walk way for 10 days and then was relegated to a corner.It is good solid wood. The holes are nice and smooth. It looked like it could be fun...for SOMEONE. I had a hidden agenda. I had adopted two kittens who were due to arrive at my home in 4 weeks, so I just waited for them to come and hoped they would like the box.The kitten paradise in the spare bedroom was put to work 4 weeks later when a black kitten and a brown tiger arrived. I had already put a cat tree in their room, so waited until they were acclimated until I tried this Toy Box. Then, I loaded it with small toys and took it in the bedroom. Sure enough, two kittens had those toys out of there and were playing with them in 30 minutes. So, nightly, I loaded the toys back in and left them with a box to play with. They have sort of lost interest, so I have hidden it for a few days and then it will reappear only every 3 or 4 days. With the exception of Dah Bird, with which the kitties will play for hours all day and every day, other toys seem to need days off so their interesting aspects can be rediscovered.I had really expected my older male cat to like this Toy Box because he delights in finding things and then carries them off to ""Kill them."" But I was wrong. Only the kittens were interested.So, I recommend this for inquisitive kittens only and then suggest that it only be put out every 3rd or 4th day as the kids get bored with it. Will they continue to like it when they are grown? I am not sure. Search through other reviews to see if someone has addressed this. It would not be at the top of my toy list. It would be at the lower end of the middle of the list. That sounds a little whacky, but you get it, right? How about this: On a list of 1. to 10. with 1. being the favorite, the Toy Box would be number 6. Ok. That is better. Happy cat plaything shopping!"
83619,2,"Our two cats love almost every cat toy. They'll chase crinkly paper balls, catnip mice, laser pointer, and sticks with feathers. But they couldn't care less about these bubbles.

94065,0,"considering that i payed about $80 for a mairineland H.O.T. filter that gave out on me within a couple months.. this was a good buy as a backup filter... I'm sure it would work fine on a smalled tank or something.. or for someone who only had 1 turtle.. i have three and keep fish in the tank as well as lve anacharis to control the algea problem.. i had it on my 29 gallon and it lasted maybe 2-4 months altogether.. but it was on a 10 gallon towards the end 2 months when it wasn't getting much suction anyways. I'd rather pay more money for a better filter than bother trying to find the blockage in these tiny tubes.. hard to clean and algea grows in the tubes and causes more blockage and turtle poo gets stuck in there and stinks! also the pictures on the box aren't how it's actually suppossed to go together according to the directions.. but most of the ""turtle filters"" actually aren't all that great anyways.. this filter was an ok alternative for me to get SOME kind of filtering and water flow while i didn't have another filter.. then i bought a new marineland filter and after messing with it some it works perfect. i have made multiple adjustments to my new marineland regular canister filter including putting a sponge on the intake tubes end to keep it from sucking up things it shouldn't and getting black plastic tubes instead of clear ones to help the algea not grow in them as much... and it's finally doing great on my 40 gallon that i have upgraded the babies into"

110308,0,"I was hoping to save some of my shoes and some money. Rawhides scare me, kongs require effort and increased calories and I had heard good things about Nylabones. My dog will not touch the originals and will occasionally chew on the chocolate one for a couple of minutes. I wouldn't get the value pack before confirming that my dog A. likes Nylabones and B. likes the originals. If you're insistent on getting these and you have a chewer, I would consider going a size up.I ended up getting a naturally shed deer antler - they cost a little more but last a really long time, don't get dirty like nylabones, are odorless and are actual bones so the vast majority of dogs like them. If you can find the ones that are cut through the middle so they expose more marrow - your dog will probably be entertained for longer periods of time. Bully sticks are also pretty much a guaranteed hit, although my boyfriend calls them butt sticks because of the terrible smell. Comment if you find something else that works. :)Update: While the nylabone still isn't his favorite - He does chew the chocolate one a little longer after I took it away and pretended that it was my phone a few different times. It also seems that it becomes more interesting after he chewed the outside lawyer some and gave it some texture."
166710,0,"First of all, I love the kong toys. They are durable, they last, and my dog enjoys eating the treats inside. We have the regular kong ball w/ the small hole in the end and she loved that so I decided to buy this one too. I bought treats shaped like biscuits to go inside the biscuit ball but found that there was still alot of space/room inside this ball-even though it was the smaller size. Our dog had no problems getting the biscuit out which is a problem since she's eating a larger treat and spent no little time playing with the ball to get to the treat. I give it a 3 because I love the kong products but didn't like this particular design."

106323,0,"These are the Free Clear Tear Stain Pads, not Eye Wash Pads or Miracle Care Eye Clear Cleaning Pads. They are the pads in a jar that you use to wipe the stains from underneath the eyes of a white dog and they work if you use them as directed, which is to wipe the areas once a day for a few days. The stains will disappear.I can't in good conscience give them 5 stars, which they deserve, because they came with a label that is misprinted, giving directions for a bottle of another product which could cause some people to misuse the product. I contacted Amazon and they immediately started to get to the bottom of the misprinted labels to get them corrected. They couldn't have been nicer and that's a big reason I keep shopping here.Anyway, if you have a white dog with tear stains, Tear Stain Pads work. I'm not familiar with any of the other Miracle Care products mentioned in my first sentence or in the product listing and can't comment on their use."
192520,0,"My two dogs love this treat/toy. With the first dog, a pointer, it can last for days and she loves going back to it. Unfortunately, the second dog I brought home from the shelter can get the large treat out in no time. He then uses those strong jaws to break it up and swallows pieces too large for him to digest. So I've had to stop giving them to him.If I still had just the pointer, I would have given this 5 stars. So you might want to try it to see if your dog will find it ""everlasting"""

157731,1,"Bought this to contain my SO's two dogs when we need to leave them at my place. It's the same size as his crate, and with the divider it's great to house a small (15lb) dog and medium (40lb) dog together in one space. Was surprised, however, to see it only has one door which makes it very awkward to adjust the divider. I suppose this was in the product description, but I must have missed it. Anyway, it works for our needs and was right in our price range."

The real plants are beneficial in absorbing nitrates, phosphates, and controling algae growth, but if you have a tank full of real plants you would have to add fertilizer, special substrate, co2 injection etc. Having fake plants in the background and a few real plants in the mid and foreground means less plant maintainance."
94174,0,"I think it's interesting how the photo shows THREE bird perches. That is what I thought I was getting. Evidently you're only getting ONE for a fairly substantial price. Honestly, I *feel* misled. If a seller's product PHOTO shows 3 items, YOU SHOULD GET 3. If only ONE perch comes with the order ONLY SHOW ONE. I tried looking at the item listing on Amazon again after I received only one perch. Some links show one perch, some show 3. Of course, perhaps the seller is illustrating the three lovely colors the perches are available in. If there are sellers out there who do not understand that showing 3 perches in the description can make customers think they are buying 3 for the price - this is for you:IF YOU SHOW A PICTURE OF 3 ITEMS IN YOUR ADD, SOME CUSTOMERS WILL THINK THEY ARE GETTING 3. You've been notified. Now, show ONE perch ANY photos related to the product if that's all you intend to ship to them.I had a similar experience recently ordering through Amazon. The photo showed one collectable item. I ordered it (at a fairly steep price, by the way), and a much different version arrived. The seller explained the the *title* of the add said it was the other version. I sent it back. I buy a great many things from Amazon. I think it's a great business and I applaud their success. HOWEVER, if they keep *not noticing* this kind of thing happening to customers, I'll start taking my business elsewhere.Both of these orders where with smaller businesses with amazon ""storefronts"" - not from Amazon themselves.As far as the item itself (as long as you understand you're only getting one for the price). It's excellent. I have 3 parakeets and they like to get on it, sharpen their beaks, and nibble at it. So, the product is very nice - just what I had hoped for. Now I just need to get a few more - and I WON'T be ordering them here."
136500,1,"The Litter Robot with the bubble window is quite an amazing product - works exactly as it is stated BUT my smallest cat, one of three, is so fascinated by the moving globe that she keeps stepping on it to see what is going on inside - therefore the robot will stop and YOU have to be there to reset it - the machine stops until it is reset by you, otherwise you will have a litter box upside down with no litter in it for the next cat. I have to resort to not leaving it on automatic, I have to turn it off when it cycles to the end and then during the afternoon, and once before retiring I hit the button to cycle it and then leave it off for the entire night. This is NOT a malfunction of the machine, it is my CAT. The other two cats could care less about the globe turning and use it with no problem whatsoever. I give this product 5 stars because it eliminates scooping litter ever again. I do not mind just having to shut it on and off a few times a day for that luxury. Customer service was extremely helpful as well because our first unit malfunctioned but they immediately sent another to replace it. again a 5 star outstanding product!"
217135,1,I brought this collar for my Pitbull I didn't read the bottom line that states add 2 to 3 inches because the company measures their collars differently than every company I've brought from in the past. Overall a great collar I don't have to worry about my Pit breaking his collar when he pulls on it while I'm walking him. I recommend this Collar with anyone who has big dogs or insanely strong dog like Pitbulls or Rotts.
51512,0,"I had one of the original dog doors from before this company changed hands, it was solid grey, with no window. They were robust, and still work beautifully.I bought another one for a dog house, brown with plexiglass inner door, a few years ago, and it wasn't as good as the original grey one. Lighter weight, and didn't seem to seal as well.This is my third one - building a dog door for my patio slider. The basics are still there - but much more flimsy then the brown one. I'll use it, but its just sad that the quality isn't what it used to be. I'd pay more for better quality."

127895,2,"Our 7 mo. Golden Retriever puppy instantly loved this toy, jamming her nose into the plush tree holes to get at the squeaky critters and carry them around a bit. Though we adored seeing her happy and supervised her closely, I think this toy has one considerable flaw- it seems poorly constructed. The concept is great, but the object just didn't hold up for the recommended play. Just by playing at our feet for a few minutes at a time, she popped a hole in the bottom, ripped the thread holding the felt leaves and seams holding the tree trunk together, and yanked out loose stuffing. She also easily ripped off the weakly adhered fur on the animal tails. We use and love interactive toys, but even for a supervised toy, it didn't stay intact for even a few days. She's had the iQube too, which was a bit sturdier. I wish this company would make a better product for the good concepts they have."
122409,0,"Okay, I read dang near every review before I made this purchase.My thoughts...This is a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper substitute compared to the tougher stackable containers in the store. But with that said, it is not without its flaws. First I must say that I saw a lot of reviews saying that this container couldn't fit a 40lb bag of dog food. That is false. Because it can. I put a 15lb bag of Wellness puppy mixed with a 15lb bag of BlueBuffalo puppy small kibble in the container, and I could have fit more than 10 lbs more. I think it all has to do with the size and density of the kibble that determines how much space it takes up in the container. If you got a 40lb bag of large light weight kibble, then you may find it hard to fit the entire bag, but if you got small breed or puppy size kibble and its a rich and heavy mix, then you will find it easy to fit more than 40lbs.But on to the flaw... the plastic, although sturdy isn't the strongest. It does get a air tight seal, but when I got my container, it was cracked. it was stacked on during shipping and the container was not tough enough to have a heavy load on top. Amazon replaced it immediately and paid return shipping, but still I'm disappointed with the quality of the plastic. But for 25 bucks, could you really expect it to be any better? Probably not. Other than it not being stackable or the strongest material, it gets the job done. I'm satisfied."

205357,0,"My cat doesn't hate the taste of this toothpaste. In fact I think he might actually like it if I wasn't jamming a foreign object in his mouth while he tasted it. The finger cap is totally useless. It's huge and impossible to use on a cat. The brush is the perfect size for a tiny feline mouth, however the bristles are way too stiff. I'm lucky enough to have a cat that won't struggle/fight during his brushing so I can be a little more gentle than if I was trying to juggle holding him down and brushing his teeth at the same time.Construction of the product is high quality, kitty will be having his teeth brushed for quite some time with this one."
46707,0,"My dogs are obsessed with these. First I bought the wrong ball - don't be confused with the treat ball where you put small treats inside. I nearly died when I realized that i needed to buy TWO balls that were more than TWENTY DOLLARS EACH!! (thinking: ""these had BETTER be good"")My dogs are 11 lbs each and I got the medium ball. I think that's the right size. I gave them each a ball with a treat in both sides. After two days gone to work (22hrs in total) they've eaten the treats. So I have to spend at LEAST $7 per dog to utilize these balls for 2 days out of the week.Hmmm...this is like a smoking addiction or something.If you need for shorter periods of time; i.e. while you watch a movie, dinner, gone for coupla hours, GREAT toy. I do have to be careful because my two dogs will fight over one ball when another is sitting a few feet away. I guess they REALLY like them.Good luck."

33709,2,"I purchased this jacket for my female yellow labrador retriever. We tried it out this week while we were experiencing unseasonably cold rains. The jacket covered her well, but it became soaked by the rain, has no moisture repellency. The problem was that the jacket took 24 hours to dry out. This was not a downpour of a rain, but more like steady showers. I am convinced that this will be a problem when snow fall is a factor. I would not buy this jacket again and I would not recommend it for others."

167250,1,"HiI searched and researched all kinds of gates and finally decided on the Richell after reading the many good reviews. I cannot tell you enough how happy and satisfied I am with this product. It is not only gorgeous looking but the quality is 100% excellent and it is supper sturdy. Just exactly what I was looking for. I bought two of them and managed to connect them together. My only complain is that there is no door so you have to step over them to get to the other side. I bought the 27"" high ones so it makes it harder to go over them. Still I give them a 9 1/2 rating out of 10 or an A-. I do not regret one bit expending the extra money for a quality product."
98372,1,"So I have 3 dogs that all love to sleep in the bed with me... 2 jack russells and a boxer.... yea... it was getting pretty crowded with Roxanne, my boxer growing so fast. so i started my research and it brought me to this bed here... i read and read and compared and just came to the conclusion that this was the bed for them... well i just received it a few days ago and the bed is awesome! at first roxanne didn't take too much interest in it... but she did what she was told and stayed in her bed... she ended up sneaking back into my bed in the morning... so of course i let her... i kno it's more of just wanting to be by my side more than anything... but as soon as she got up samson, one of my jack russells, jumped right into her bagel bed and knocked out! the only thing now is that they don't want to share... so i'm going to end up ordering another 2 beds for them. so each one of my dogs have their own little bed... i ordered the XL thinking they would all just cuddle together cause that thing is huge... but it's more than big enough for roxanne, and i'll be ordering the mediums for my other 2 doggies. i read the reviews about the whole washing them thing... i think i like that there isn't a cover and u have to wash the whole thing. i mean it's not like if the dog smell is just in the cover... it's in the whole bed... so it just makes sense to wash the whole thing... i'm just saying. but again this doggie bed... AWESOME!! so worth my money!!"
193168,0,"Ordered this bed after reviewing several brands. The dog bed arrived when expected, but we ended up returning it. We have a big lab-mix indoor dog and we found the medium -sized bed too small. Although the bed seemed well-made, with a nice thick pad that was quite soft and comfortable, the heating element in the pad seemed to generate very little, if any heat. The mild vibrating function of the bed appeared to work well. I tried to order the next size up on the same bed, but at the time it was not available and I noticed was considerably higher in price when it would be available. If your dog is over 70 lbs I would suggest the large size, hopefully the bigger size has a heating pad that generates more heat."
110078,2,Bought this stuff after my dog ate something and vomited heavily on my carpet. I followed the directions exactly but the vomit smell was still overwhelming. I re-treated and the smell was still there. I ended up re-treating again and again till I went through the whole bottle on one spot. Even after using the whole bottle the smell was still there. I would not buy this again.
172437,1,great product. cuts your kitty litter work in half but they're a bit pricey. buy the liners and get some extra uses out of each receptacle.
83451,0,"I purchased this crate for my newly adopted greyhound. I thought the price was very good, and looked forward to receiving it and setting it up prior to his arrival. When the shipment arrived, the box was literally battered to death. The heavy duty copper staples were pulled out of the corners in some instances and, as I am sure you can surmise, some of the bars on the crate were now bent and took quite a bit of work to get them where they would lock into place as needed. The door locks still will not line up unless I push down on the top each time I put him in there. This manufacturer needs to seriously re-evaluate how they package such a heavy item for shipping. At the minimum, a much heavier grade cardboard and how about some corner supports to keep those from giving way during shipment? I literally could tear the cardboard apart with my hands. Not sturdy at all!"
214038,2,Both my dogs had a bad case of goopy eyes and I gave this product a shot. The entire system takes a while to complete and it's not easy it remember what step to do next.

16764,0,"I have a middle-aged female brittany with moderate separation anxiety. I've moved into my parent's house for a few months and I have to lock her in the basement while I am at work. Soon after I moved in, my dad (who works from home) reported that she barks for about THREE hours while I am gone. My vet recommended the spray collar.At first it worked PERFECTLY. She stopped barking after about 4 barks. But after about a month the spray thing stopped working and leaked citronella all over her one day! However, I called the company and they set a new one a few weeks later at no cost (They gave us new extra spray and a new battery too!).The second collar worked well for about two more months. But just recently, things have changed. She now barks occasionally while locked in the basement (but not nearly as much). Then, when she hears me get home from work and when she sees me...she gets so excited that she lets loose! She barks up a storm, letting the collar spray her (and me as she tries to lick my face...). She has also figured out that the collar is the source of her troubles. I take it off when I come home (to let her out) and the minute she hears it ""click!"" off, she barks louder and more frantically than ever! I'm just hoping she doesn't figure out how to take it off herself. I wouldn't put it past her!So, all in all, it has helped out for when I'm away from home quite a bit, but I get a shower of citronella when I come home..."

108037,2,Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there. From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work? Oh yeah quite well in fact. BUT so does the cheap stuff. I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference. At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .

I got the little seat that attaches to the top, and that helps, but overall it just sits in the corner and they don't really mess with it. It's an expensive toy that simply gets no use. I think it could be a lot sturdier - I don't blame them for not climbing on it, I'd be afraid of it falling, too."

Our two cats are on the larger side so I figured I's give them more room in their bathroom by getting the bigger box. It works great except that it's underpowered. For whatever reason, when one of the cats uses the litter box the other has to do the same about 5 minutes later. The LME9000 isn't always strong enough to take the waste out of the box from two cats at the same time so I end up having to clean it manually."

7215,0,"I own two cats and have two litter boxes--one Clevercat and one front-entry. One cat tends to leap out of the Clevercat and scatter litter everywhere, so it doesn't really work when he uses it. The other stops on top of the lid of the Clevercat on her way out, which reduces her litter scatter. Bottom line: you won't be able to tell how your cat will react until it uses the box. I'd say it's very slightly better than a front-entry box, but not good enough to purchase another."

In consistency it is like soft pepperoni sausage, which makes it more convenient to handle than canned food under some circumstances. For example, I can cut a slice of it and send it with my dog to dog care in a plastic bag, whereas sending canned food can be a problem if I want to give him a portion less than a whole can.The roll is shelf stable for a period of time, but once opened must be refrigerated, and if you are not going to use it for a while, should be frozen. This is a large roll which will take up space in the fridge. I put a plastic grocery bag over the open end and held it on with rubber bands.Three stars because of the ingredients. The ingredients are listed differently on the roll than they are on this or any other website that I've found. The first three listed ingredients are: lamb lungs, wheat flour, and sugar. Many dogs are allergic to wheat, so this is not a great choice; and I can't imagine why there should be sugar in anything claiming to be a dog food. Maybe in a dog treat."

Two of the squirrels have holes and need to be sewn up before my puppy can play with it.I bought the Jumbo size in the hope that my dog would get plenty of playtime with the toy and its very disappointing that the quality is so poor.

16949,0,"I bought this product because my dog won't stop barking when tied up outside. When I first put it on her, she would bark and immediately get sprayed in the face. While it definitely helped her stop barking (at first), she quickly learned that if she barked enough, the collar would quickly empty and then she could continue to bark her little heart out. It was a pain to keep running outside to refill the collar as it doesn't hold enough spray at one time. She also went through 1 can of spray in 2 days. Another drawback, the dog smells after wearing the collar. I think the collar would work for the less determined dog but for us it was a fail. It may work if you are willing to keep refilling the collar every 10 minutes for a few days. It is a good place to start for those who don't want to use the shock collar like ourselves."

It is difficult to empty the feed bag into the front of the storage unit as you have to keep pushing the feed toward the back to make room for the rest of the bag. I don't find them particularly rugged either as the bottom one has collapsed a little on one corner after only a couple of months use. I appreciate their space saving feature but probably would not purchase another.
115299,1,"Bought this to use for dog food. It is big enough to hold the big bags of dog food from costco. Has a big opening so filling it with food is quick and easy. Also, it is well built and easy to open and close the lid. My four year old love to help feed the dogs because she can open and close it all by herself."
186840,1,"Normally I would consider salmon snacks to be for cats, but my dog loved these little treats! These are actual dried scraps of salmon, not processed treats of crushed salmon by-product. The only reason I give this product four stars rather than five is that they smell kind of, well, fishy."
116591,0,"It's a kennel. Four chain-link walls and a little door. Certainly strong enough to contain my dachshund - at least as long as we keep it on concrete; if we put it on anything unpaved he'd have himself dug out by lunchtime.The Good Stuff: The instructions depict the door on one of the short sides of the structure. It was surprisingly easy to move it to one of the long sides. Assembly is reasonably uncomplicated, but it helps if you've had some chain-link experience prior to attempting it.The Bad Stuff: REALLY cheap chain link - as I said before, strong enough for a mini dachshund, but I'd be concerned if I had a real manly-man type of dog. The corners of the door are rounded off, which leaves *just* a big enough gap that a small dog like ours could squeeze out if he tried hard enough, so we have to put concrete blocks in front of each of the two lower corners of the door. Also, you'll need at least two people, preferably three, to put it up. Trust me on this.The best thing of all about this kennel was that it cost virtually nothing to ship. I was originally planning to buy it from Home Depot, which sells the same product ten dollars cheaper - but they wanted $180 to ship it. Yes, that's right - one hundred eighty dollars, more than two thirds the cost of the kennel itself. I paid about ten dollars more for the kennel here on Amazon, and they shipped it to me for something like $4.99. Such a deal."
179323,0,"I was confused by the wording of the advertisement. Be aware that size 1/4 indicates the number of the comb. It really trims the hair to 11/16""."
138652,0,I was very happy to find this item at Amazon. The pet shops around here (north of Boston) don't seemto be able get them lately. This is my dog's favorite chew treat. The flossies I received were on thethin side. The ones at the pet shop from the same company were more substantial. I hope in the futurethey are more substantial.
151421,2,"I found this machine to be ineffective. It both gave my cat more food than I had scheduled for and allowed for her to ""steal"" much more. My 8 pound cat weighed in at 12 pounds after 6 months on this feeder. I am dispensing her food now and she has lost most of the weight. Good product idea, bad execution."
82192,2,"Broke within 10 minutes of use. Very expensive and doesn't work. My cats are not hard players, yet our blind cat broke it immediately"
182549,1,"Just did a review for the woven mat because I make sure I have them both at all times. This gives our rabbit hours of fun while the kids are at school. I asked our local pet store to have them in their store but at the price they're selling them here at Amazon and the free shipping, she said I'm really better off ordering them at this website."
57459,2,Be warned: We just opened a box of six doses and all were empty or near empty. Lot No. F41751. Will never order this item online again.
53366,0,"I bought it as a ""filler"" for a pet order and wasn't disappointed when it picked up very little fur. The Furminator works much better (and costs 20x as much). My beagle seems to like the glove, but I think he's just in it for the tickles as no hair is released."
187228,1,"This was a very good purchase. It shipped quickly, was a snap to assemble and is definitely of adequate quality - particularly when compared to all of the other fancy or expensive options out there. We started out with a smaller crate made of PVC parts, nylon fabric and black mesh. However, two weeks after he was with us, we ordered this crate and our new 4 month-old Boston Terrier puppy loves it!! We put a very plush fuzzy cushion in it and his big blanket. The price is definitely a plus since we will only use it his first year or so until he is fully trained. He seemed to immediately enjoy the visibility of it and the kids can still pet him when he is in it. Definitely worthwhile."
202141,0,"I purchased due to all the hype. However, compared to a similar styled brush (less than half the price) purchased at a local pet store, there was absolutely no difference in performance. So... I am going to chalk this one up to plain hype. It works - and it works well, but it gets 3/5 stars due to obscene price without any improvement. Buy it if the price won't hurt your pocketbook, but if it will, look for a brush with closely spaced, short metal bristles, and you will be fine."
139461,1,My cat loves the Kitty Mat and it is made well and is nice looking.Great service and delivery!
107717,1,I use it on my 80 lb doberman and it works great. It's long enough to let him run while I catch up to him and sturdy enough for me to hold him steady. Had one previously and he bit it for a few months before it fully broke. Trying to keep him from doing the same to this one.
30345,2,"Product was completely ineffective. Dogs were intrigued by the sound. Seemed to consider the sofa I put it on a ""giant squeak toy"". If you're trying to train your dogs to remain interested in getting on your sofas, this is the product for you.The extremely limited return policy included with the product (that's not described prior to purchase) suggests the manufacturer knows that this thing is largely useless. Essentially, if you've opened the box, installed the battery, and listened to the weak alarm sound once it's not returnable."
121278,2,"If you have to use pain to get your dog to do what you want him/her to do, that's not training. Stop being so lazy and learn how to properly train your dog(s). Take a proper training class with your dog. My pup will do anything I ask, no collar, no pain."
144475,2,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food. However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey. The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery. I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color. My dog really likes the older version much better. I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better."
16202,0,Great item for heating a crate but beware my little 7 pound dog has chewed threw the cord were the pad and cord meet and has also chewed the corners of the pad which can become a fire hazard.
37433,2,"did I like it, no , not for the cost, they just ignored it, and the little ones just drug it around they won't sleep with it... they perfered a warm just out of the dryer soft blanket, would I buy again NO, would I recommend.... No not for the price...1.99 maybe."
131496,1,"We bought 2 of these 6 years ago mainly for camping. They have held up wonderfully, wash well. We just got another dog and I was so happy to find these were still available. The materials don't seem as sturdy but time will tell. Love them!"
95002,1,"Worked like a charm. My dog is very small - 13 lbs - so the collar is a bit big but can be adjusted to fit him. Best of all, it worked. I am sold on this purchase. Now all I have to do is put the collar on him and he quiets down."
173790,1,"My border collie mix has torn apart every toy I've bought except for this Kong. We are on month 4 and there is no major damage :-). The best part is that it keeps her busy and entertained. Instead of peanut butter or the expensive ""stuff"" you can put inside, I use Nilla Wafers! She loves them and when I break them in half they fit perfectly inside. Just the right size so she can get them out with a little work and there is no mess!"
77145,0,"Nice looking little pen for a young puppies. However, the horizontal bars & vertical bar spacing, provide an excellent ""ladder"" for any climber to easily get out of. My 10 week old yorkie figured out how to scale the wall in less than a minute. I'm not sure the hexagon model with higher walls would be any better due to same design. I have used a superyard XT at friends house & my puppy isn't able to scale that due to tiny holes her paws won't easily fit in, so I'd recommend that instead, but it doesn't have a door, which is why I ordered this one. I'm gonna try to make a cover for it out of mesh material & tie it to the top. Wish me luck :)"
100740,1,"One of our dogs is addicted to this ball. She will not let the other dogs near it, but we keep it up when there are other dogs around just to make sure it is not destroyed. Most of our other dogs are either indifferent to it, or will destroy it in a matter of minutes. But Jesse will carry this around all day and beg us to throw it for her. It really depends on the dog as to how long this ball will last. It is soft rubber, so it does not take much for one of the links to be chewed through. Once one link is gone, the rest will fall apart."
27242,0,"I was excited to get this product and give my fish a nice place to rest. However, within days the stems are coming out of the base and the leaves are sliding all along the stems. I've purchased some aquarium silicone to fix the problem but for the price, I expected MUCH better quality."
192512,0,"The toy is a great concept. My dog loved to roll it around and knaw on it. Totally kept him occupied. The unfortnate thing is this ""everlasting"" treat ball is far from everlasting. My dog had both sides chewed down within one day. After it was chewed down flat he wanted to have nothing to do with it. The ball it's self is around 17 dollars and only came with one treat. The ball fits 2 treats so you instantly have to buy the refill pack which costs about 8 dollars. Cant afford 8 dollars a day in treats."
156906,0,"I have a 30lb dog who is a year old. She is what is known as an""avid"" chewer. I thought this would be strong enough for her - it's not. She LOVED it, though. I think all dogs are smart in their own way so what I'm about to say, I don't think is just ""her"", but she figured out the concept in about 2 min. Meaning, she figured out how to flip it exactly to get all the treats pouring out and this is on the hard level. I wish it were stronger and had been harder for her. It lasted a week in our house and then she chewed up so much of it, I had to throw it away. Even after she got all the treats out, she still enjoyed it. I think she liked the shape."

20825,1,"My crabitat is decorated to look like a beach resort, so this item looks amazing in it. It is well made, good quality, worth the price.

87995,0,"I have owned this fountain for a while now. First of all, my cats love drinking from this fountain. They like the sound of the splashing water and that it is constantly filtered (no food bits in the water they are actually drinking).My biggest issue is that I cannot clean it completely. I do not know why they designed it with so many sharp points (they hurt!) and corners (cannot clean all the growths that form over time). I suppose if you were to clean it every other day or so, those growths would not form, but that is unreasonable (it takes a good 15 minutes to clean thoroughly).I will definitely keep on using a fountain, just not this one. I noticed in the store that one called ""CatIt"" seemed to have a more simple design (easier to clean), though I will check the reviews first!"

I have the large Power Walker, figured it'd hold up longer than the cheapo brand retractable leash we were finally retiring after about 7 years. Nope. This thing lasted about 6 months, and now won't retract. I tried to take it apart to fix it, but even that isn't cooperating with me. For the money these things cost, you'd expect it to last a bit longer. Do yourself a favor and get the store brand--that way, if it only lasts a few months (which it probably won't--it'll probably last years) you won't have lost buckets of cash on it."
190594,0,"This is a great product. However, when we received the container, the plastice safety seal over the food was half off. We decided to keep the food anyway but might concider going back to a pet store to buy this food so it can be inspected before puchase."
49640,1,If you are reading this I am sure you love your dog(s) as much as we love ours. We have a place in the country and the pups pick up a lot of ticks. This tool does an amazing job of removal and holding the offending wretched little tick in place until you can dispose of it rightly. I have pulled upwards of 20 ticks with this tool and am really grateful I have it every time I use it. Definitely recommend it!
126281,1,"I recently bought this carrier because I will be traveling on a plane with my 8 month old kitten. She's a big kitten and she fits comfortably in the carrier. I'm very glad I decided to get the Medium size. The small would have been too small for her.The bag seems very well made. She loves the faux lambskin liner. She keeps kneading at it.Right now, I have the carrier open on the floor and she's taking her toys in it to play.I've included a picture of her in the carrier."
162706,0,"the set is beautiful and does make my dog happier to be in her kennel - when she gets tired at night, she goes in all by herself! Less or no barking at night at bedtime for the family and no doing her business in her kennel any more. Suggestions: the velcro should be replaced with something that a smart dog can't figure out how to undo and chew off of the bumpers. Also, an elastic band across the bottom of the cover, to go underneath the kennel would keep my dog from removing the cover when she is not in the kennel. All in all, a good product, just needs a couple of small tweaks to be perfect!"
214683,1,"We've been very happy with the dog tie out, and have used it on a 100' line that reaches between two trees. A hint though............buy turn-buckles so that your dog can't get all the way to the trees and can't get wrapped around the tree. Also, our dog tried (and was successful) in pulling out of his collar, and off the line, so we bought a separate collar and keep it attached to the tie out, so that the collar for the tie out is always put further down his neck than his standard collar--it keeps him from pulling loose!"

191737,0,"While I don't mind Carefresh for my rats, I will say that I don't prefer it. MY biggest gripe about it, is that it consistently has a strange odor. Its not necessarily bad, just weird. It does absorb rather well, and the regular gray color hides 'droppings'. If you can get passed the odd smell of the bedding then you may like it more, but I had to switch to a combo of soft-sorbent mint and fresh world bedding. It is my favorite thus far."

39443,2,"Since I have two kitties, I was in dire search of a new method of keeping the kitty litter clean. I always maintained two kitty boxes, one for each but it was such a pain to keep both clean. I researched some of the newer automated litter boxes and found that they were either way too expensive or were not effective at all. Then I came across all of the reviews on the Omega PAW RA20 Self Cleaning litter box. I was amazed at all of the wonderful reviews it received. And since the price was so affordable I decided to give it a shot. I'm sorry I did. Here are some of the issues I had with the litter box:1> Very large, if you are thinking of putting this in a medium sized bathroom as I thought, think again. It is way too large to neatly fit into an average size space. I guess if you plan on putting this in a large basement, you should be safe.2> Due to the size, this brings me to the next issue - how the unit works - you must tilt the box one way and over and then back again. The concept is great but if you are in a cramped space, forget it. It was hit or miss for me, sometimes it collected the do do and sometimes not. Being so large, it requires a great amount of kitty litter. Try tilting 10 lbs of kitty litter and you'll know what I am talking about.3> How it's constructed - for $40 bucks what would you expect but it is made of cheap plastic. The fasteners were also very cheaply made too. I would not expect it to last that long.4> If you are like me, and if your cats are like mine, they want a nicely cleaned litter box at least weekly or at most bi-weekly. Cleaning this LARGE unit was a chore all in itself. I was also nervous about those cheaply made fasteners... when they go, the unit is gone. In order to clean the unit, those fasteners need to slide off. Getting them back on was another issue. Since I clean the box every week, i don't use liners... not too sure if you can find liners to fit this monstrosity.Take my review for what it is worth. It is obvious that others found this unit to be great. I for one cannot understand what all the hoopla is all about.My Omega Paw RA20 litter box is now occupying a space in the garage awaiting its final destination in the trash can. I am now back to the old traditional method of a litter box with the scooper. My cats and I are very happy with that."
167475,0,"I bought this at the pet store. Our rabbit wouldn't use it for a while, but once she got use to it it was just OK. I think that she eats less hay when we use this compared to if we just gave it to her in a pile. It works great in theory, depending on your rabbit's personality.Cons:You have to keep it stuffed to the fullest with hay, or else once it gets down to about half full the hay sort of hovers out of reach in the center and your rabbit won't be able to get at it.Takes up a lot of cage space, even mounted on the wall. I guess it needs extra room for the spinning...The spinning concept doesn't work so well in practice. When mounted on the stand it comes with, it will spin but will immediately spin back into the original position because of the weight of the hay. Our rabbit likes to pick and choose, so sometimes if she doesn't like any of the pieces sticking out of the side facing her she won't eat the hay at all. She eats the most when we just leave it on the floor with one plastic side taken off so it's like a bowl, but then that defeats the purpose.The little swing-open door is pretty much useless. I usually just pop one side of the plastic off to fill it.Pros:Keeps the hay clean, fresh and off the floor.Pretty well made.. Sturdy plastic that didn't get any looser after snapping it on and off to fill the thing.Prevents the rabbit from throwing the hay all over the place (which our buns will do).Entertains the rabbit a bit. When we first gave this to her she would throw it all over the place instead of eating the hay, so we finally mounted it to the cage."

We were having a very cold snap, so we were running the heat a lot and the whole house was filled with static. We were getting shocked whenever we touched each other or anything for that matter, and our hair was standing out when we would comb it, etc. I was hoping this would help when combing my long haired Persian, so his coat would lay flat but it didn't make any difference. I even used it with an anti-static spray-on coat conditioner, but no change. Still, all in all, a decent pet comb with a good handle."

I purchased the Kurgo Pet Booster seat instead and this was much better choice for me because my dog can still see out the window, I can still use the seat below, and my claustrophobia doesn't start creeping in on me!**Other Useful Comments --The color is definitely khaki.

I purchased my feeder else where cheaper, and can say it was worth the purchase. However, there are some cons I would like to point out.Cons:1) Cannot set a designated time;2) Container bit small for supposedly 1 months feeding; guess if you feed once a day it will last a month; and3) No clamp to support to fish tank only a couple of velcro strips"

50503,0,"I wasn't sure how many stars to put, because I didn't use the product. When I received it and read through the installation instructions, I realized that we had a problem. It has to be attached directly to the outlet and attached to the transmitter by a short wire. Unfortunately, our transmitter is plugged into an extension cord. There's no outlet near the window in our garage where the perimeter wire originates. So, we couldn't use it. It was my mistake, because I didn't look into the installation process before purchasing.If your transmitter is plugged directly into a wall outlet, it seems (from the other reviews) that it would work very well.I also want to thank Amazon for giving us a refund. When we figured out that we couldn't use it, I stuck the box in a corner and forgot about it. I just returned it - long past the return policy time limit - and got a refund.

I chose the shipping but can't say to date that it has been done. So that is disappointing. As for the product itself I am very please. Ella, my dachshund, seems to enjoy it.

203777,0,"This product works but beware the finicky cat. I have three cats and only one will let me use this product on her. The other two literally hiss and bite at me when I bring the comb any where near them. I suppose I should have seen this coming because the two that hate the FURminator also hate being brushed by a regular brush.However, if you have a cat that loves to be brushed and sheds a lot, this is a great product. It really does remove bags of fur and she's softer than when I brush her with a regular brush. Her coat looks really healthy as well. Her fur isn't all over the couch anymore.My husband who is allergic to cat hair hasn't noticed a discernible difference in his allergen sensitivity in the two months that I have owned this brush. I brush her at least every other day if not more. Maybe the FURminator would help his allergies if all of my cats were willing to be groomed but since that isn't the case, my husband still sneezes and his nose still runs and he has to take allergy pills everyday."
137070,0,"Before purchasing this K & H Kitty Sill, I read reviews galore about this and many others. In the end, I had to screw this seat to the window sill because the brackets wouldn't stay in the slots (and still fell off even after using the screws). The cats use it, but I have not seen them lying on it like in the picture."
108567,0,"I bought the 48 X 20 mat and the extension pad to cover a large entranceway in my home.Positives:1. The dogs only needed to try it once or twice to be aware of what it does.2. It does generally keep them out of the room.3. A humane punitive corrector.Negatives:1. It fires CONSTANTLY for no reason and I can not find out why or how to stop it.2. Must buy ac adapter since the battery will die in a day or two because of item # 13. While it fires constantly when no one is on it, it doesn't always go off when the dogs are on it.4. Sometimes they will take ""the hit"" to get across but not to leave the room.*Point to keep in mind, a coated dog or cat that has hair between its pads is not going to get as strong of a correction if any. Kind of what you would feel on it if you were wearing socks.All in all its good for a couch or an area of the home you dont want animals in, but you will need two times more mat than you think so that the animals cant get around it."

110114,2,My Burmese rag doll cat did not like this at all. So buy this if you want to roll the dice. Every cat has his/her own finicky likes/dislikes. The odor can be a bit off-putting for more sensitive breeds.
87601,1,"I bought the original Drinkwell and can't stand it because it is extremely hard to clean when there isn't a dishwasher available. I bought the cleaning tools recommended for it but, without a dishwasher to put the parts in, its just a big pain in the @** to clean. My cats love the running water though so I knew I had to get a fountain of some sort. My sist has the Platinum one and she showed me how easy it was to clean! I bought it, my cats LOOOOVE it, and I'm very happy I bought it.There is a review on here by someone of the different types of drink fountains and that review also really helped me to pick the Platinum fountain. I was also looking at the 360 one, but after reading that review, I realized that the Platinum one would probably better suit both the needs of my kitties and myself."

34730,2,"I bought this thinking it would be a great starter kit to go along with an impulse buy of a beta fish. The pictures on the box look nothing like the actual product. It is very cheap plastic and I suspect they are prone to leaking like I have read, although to be fair, mine does not leak. It does have the requisite items to get you started but none of the materials are exceptional. The clear plastic used instead of glass is warped EVER....EVER so slightly and this causes major distortion. It lasted about a week before I felt guilty for keeping a live animal is that thing and have replaced with it with a proper glass bowl, gravel, and live plants...all of which look better and didn't cost but a few dollars more.Also the ""instructions"" for care of the beta fish itself contradict a few other books that I have thumbed through (and am following with success).Buy at your own risk. Again, I replaced mine (which was still in working order) for a REAL set up after only a week, for only a few dollars more.I still have the fish and am loving the look of it in my home and the experience of caring for it."
155345,0,This product looks pretty good. Was not that hard to put together. The hole in the door is cut too low. You have to have an extremely shallow kitty litter box so it doesn't show. I have to medium to large size cats and they fit in it just fine.
93526,0,"Well i bought this product for my dungarian hamster, she isnt a draft for isnt full size, which is a good thing because this is tiny she fits in it perfectly. it has cute colors but the little lader that came with it doesnt stay on and it was terrible to put together it took me an hour to fit the peices, on top of that its impossible to clean the bottom part because you cant take it apart. but my little hamster loves it and tho the plastic is cheap it has yea to be broken but it helps that she isnt a chewer."
106135,0,"My dog got an abrasion on the top of her head, which is notoriously hard to stop from bleeding due to the excess of nerves and veins. We tried flour, liquid bandage, and even actually bandaging her head (not recommended, as I later found out, since dogs will invariably do all they can to remove the bandaging and will likely disturb the wound in the process). Eventually I bought this because it's the one thing I haven't tried. Turns out it's about as effective as flour, meaning, it's effective when it is reapplied with vigilance and if your dog stays mostly inactive/unexcited. It's just thousands of times more expensive than flour ($6.66 for .5oz versus $2.99 for 5lbs, you do the math). I think this is meant for when a dog endures scratches or if you accidentally cut the bulb during nail cutting. That or if you dog is very calm."
9646,0,I was hoping this pad was leak proof but it's not. At least not for my old diabetic pug who has a bladder as big as a lab! Maybe good for puppies who have little piddles but I can't comfirm that. Why can't they make a pad with the same backing as baby diapers? This one just didn't work for me any better than newspapers.
60971,0,"My 4 year old cat does not chew these toys, she bats them around frantically and shoots them straight under the nearest appliance or rug.I wish she would just chew them, so that I could stop digging around under the stove and the fridge. She really does love them, just not for what they're marketed as.I wish that my 1.5 year old cat would chew these instead of everything else in the house, but she is not interested in them -- she doesn't really stand a chance, though, as they're not out for long before they get hidden."
76364,1,"I purchased this crate to that I could take my new Cocker Spaniel camping, and it ended up not being used for that purpose. However, I used it when I was moving and it was perfect! It was easy to setup and eventhough she is quite the little chewer, she never chewed through it. It was easy to fold back up (once I realized how), and stores great! I would recommend this for anyone who needs a quick and convenient alternative to large metal crates."
199279,1,"I bought this for my lab mix puppy. She has short fur, but is prone to shedding. She was a little hesitant at first, but I think she would have been that way with any brush. I used it for only a couple of minutes at first, and worked up each time. Now she really enjoys getting brushed. I think it feels like she's getting a little scratch! This really does take care of a lot of the excess fur and shedding, and is very gentle. I like how most of the hair that is pulled out stays in the teeth. This keeps the mess-factor to a minumum. I highly recommend this product, especially at the low price at which Amazon is selling it."
129093,0,"This is not a maintenance free system as advertised. We bought a litter genie and have to scoop the capture tray once a day.

On the plus side, the crystals do a good job drying out the poop and keeping odor in check."
79855,2,"hi I have a community with a variety of fish, top, middle & bottom feeders. None of the fish prefer this brine shrimp, it actually clouds my tank. All the fish actually love the krill. If anybody wants to try any type of fish food, I would suggest them to get a sample from the LFS or from their friends, feed it to the fish, if they eat it then its worth to buy otherwise its a waste of money."
132842,1,Ive read the reviews on this product and it seemed kinda split in customer reviews so I decided to give it a shot. Im glad I brought it. Its a cheap price and the dogs react well towards it. My family has an annoying dog where it barks at everything for no reason. Finally I got fed up with the barking. This product is worth the money and the chance to try it. Now theres less barking and Im less annoyed with the dog haha.
130888,0,"I bought this for a humid cage 75% to 90% humidity. It worked great for about a month or so. My plants grew great in it. Had a four layer system and would mist daily. It started molding. Had to completely re-do my cage. Good bedding, just not for what I needed."

The Oster comb is a good product if the particular one considered is not defective -- it's a copy of a good Greyhound comb."
134965,0,"As everyone says, this is a quiet filter with a strong flow. Well made but has a couple of &#34;issues&#34;. The most annoying is there's no molded plastic piece that goes over the edge of the tank on the return hose. You have to essentially make one out of the provided tubing. Of course, any tubing you flex like that wants to kink to some degree, and I suspect my return flow may be slightly compromised. This could easily be fixed by including an inexpensive molded piece (like the intake has) for the over-the-edge-and-right-turn angle, or heck, just mold it on to the return spray bar. Secondly, I was disappointed the unit didn't have separate media baskets like the Rena series. This one will be slightly more of a hassle to clean, and I do like the segmented basket approach over this &#34;dump it all in a can&#34; design. Finally, the instructions are ridiculous. Incomplete and incomprehensible. They should be ashamed to ship that mess. If you find this filter at an appreciably better price than it's competitors, I think it will do an acceptable job but I wouldn't buy it again. I hate putting up with annoyances on hobby products that cost this much."
23027,1,"I have a Maine Coon cat that is long haired. And although he doesn't shed all that much on a day-to-day basis, he did have a period of time when it was much worse (one of his bi-annual times for ""molting"".) And I received the FURMinator just in time. It worked great in removing a lot of excess undercoat when used the first couple of times. Now that the heavy shedding time seems to be past it still gets out the extra hair he'd likely shed & he looks beautiful & feels like silk. I highly recommend this product for all cat owners."
100184,0,"I bought this toy for my puppy. He is a strong and aggressive chewer. He had this for less than 5 minutes and had already destroyed it.

I highly recommend this product for wayward, dogs, wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, naughty children, and or any other animals and or humans that need be restrained by leash within the reasonable length of say 16' plus or minus depending on how severe the traffic might be in that instant case!!!!!! Go for it, you will not regret having this item in your inventory of restraints or leashes. So Say I, Judge Chops."

110801,2,"I am sitting here watching my dog completely sound asleep after a $600 emergency vet visit. We did as instructed with this toy last night and sat with our Pit/Mastif 17month old puppy named Daisy. She loved it and today we went out for two hours to look at homes to buy. When we returned she did her usual running around and greeting us with her new toy in her mouth. Several minutes later she was laying at our feet with her toy still there. While reaching out to grab the toy and play with her it was stuck. I mean stuck. She had literally gotten her entire lower jaw stuck in the hole that you take in and out to place the food into. Not a tooth not a hair, her entire jaw. I cannot believe that this is the first occurance for this toy. It definately needs some redesign or removal from market. This toy has cut a ring around her jaw to the point of bleeding and massive swelling because of how it was lodged. We bought the large version as HELLO we have a large dog. If you really care for your pet, look elsewhere for a toy that does keep them entertained when you are not around. It kept our baby entertained alright. But she couldn't eat or drink as she walked around with a 6 inch cube stuck to the front of her face. We feel pathetic that we did this to her."
31466,2,"I had two cats that were constantly at each other. Jasmine pretty much laid around on a big pillow all day. Mogie would stalk her, run up and swat her, etc. all day long. I gave this product a try, in hopes that he would calm down and quit harassing Jasmine. I plugged it in right by her pillow. I didn't notice any changes in either of them. Mogie still bullied, and Jasmine still hissed, screamed, and occasionally charged Moglie. Jasmine remained totally stressed out, independent of the pheromone, so she has gone to another home. :-( (Mogie is a BAD cat, but a great companion for me. Couldn't send my soulmate away!) I still have another cat, so I'm going to try drugs next on Mogie. (A mild antidepressant that is known to reduce aggression in cats) In any case, this product might work for minor problems or as ""aromatherapy"", but it didn't work for us."

74580,0,"Since this gate has been reviewed many times, I will simply add my experience as concisely as possible in terms of using this as a baby gate.Pro:1. Sturdy metal structure2. No foothold for small children to climb up on the gate3. If not latch is not locked down, you can open the gate with one hand. However, my 9 month old daughter is on the verge of figuring out how to open it when unlocked, so that is a consideration.4. Easy install, though instructions could use some clarity. I did not install any extensions, however, so YMMV.5. No problems navigating the gate for my cats.Cons:1. The main gate opens in only one direction. When I set it up with the gate latch on the right (i.e. the gate opens toward you), I discovered that the pet door will swing into your walking path if not open. Since we have three cats, it is open all the time, thus the problem. I re-installed it with the latch on the left (i.e. the gate opens away from you) and that worked better, though the pet door is frequently flapping around unhappily.2. The pet gate is not removable. This is a problem if you use this as a baby gate, since small children can swing the open pet gate toward them and catch their fingers. I had to tape it in the wide open position to avoid this. Would have been easy to make the pet gate removable or place the pet gate in a section that was not part of the main gate, both of which would have made this more functional as a baby gate. I get the feeling that the designers of this gate never field tested it for this purpose.3. The pet gate is too wide. My 9 month old daughter was able to crawl through it, obviously defeating the purpose of having a gate in the first place.4. If the gate is locked down, it takes two hands to unlock it. That is problematic in many different scenarios. For example, the gate is set to keep the baby out of the laundry room and the laundry room is the entryway from the garage, through which we carry all the groceries.5. The gate has about an 1"" high threshold. In addition to tripping over it more times than I would like, forget about dragging a vacuum cleaner, bucket, baby wagon, etc. into the room behind you - you will need to lift it over the threshold.6. While the gate seems sturdy, the plastic lock mechanism feels cheap."
58233,0,"This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG brand and never had a problem.

It looks like one but is actually a knockoff with a Booda Dome filter taped inside. While assembling the product three pieces fell off. It is flimsy to say the lease. This is not going to last three weeks. The actual Booda Dome is constructed to take a beating. I am so disappointed. What happened Amazon!? Not worth $5 more less the price I paid."

112860,0,"Our cats are generally very well behaved but since we got a second cat, the two play so rigorously that sometimes they damage the surrounding furniture. We were concerned about our leather couches, otherwise, everything else was fine. The covers themselves do a perfect job of really blunting the nails, they try to scratch but not even the slightest nick shows!Application was a tricky part. The front paws are easy since you can nestle the cat between your legs as you kneel down and make a V shape out of them. The hind legs are harder and is a two person job because our cats do resist. You may have to make do with a few hind nails at a time. I tried doing them all at once and Snowy got so emotionally upset about it, so I gave him a generous treat that day.They also fell off more quickly that I expected. Within a few days, half of them fell off, but maybe next time I'll try to trim their nails shorter so the cap fits on more snugly, there were a few nails that were still on the longer end.And the third issue is what has been the biggest concern that some already mentioned. Maybe I did not apply the caps well enough, but one day, Snowy got his nail caught in a loop of carpet. He was so distressed and screaming his little head off. He kept yanking to get his paw away but I got it out of the carpet for him by pulling forward then back because of how the nails curve.I am debating just getting slip covers for the couches and resuming to regular nail trimming since that is the only problem. They miss scratching their scratching posts (it is a source of leisure and exercise for them too), dislike having these put on especially if these fall off so fast anyways, and the event with getting stuck at the carpet was very scary. Oh yes, the price I find to be high. $20 for 40 and having to continuously replace those can get costly. Or, if I do try it again, I would be sure to cut their nails shorter for a more snug fit, maybe they will stay on longer then."

My biggest problem was that the litter would spill out of the back when I attempted to roll the box.

Since then, I've done 2 treatments on the table and he still pees there. I am going to toss the table obviously. In general, I feel like it wasn't a miracle product. Maybe if I used it as soon as my cat started peeing there it would have been better."
125992,1,"This toy has a pouch that you fill with catnip. The company enclosed an entire cylinder of catnip, so you'll have plenty of it to refill this toy with for months to come. I'd recommend this not only because my cat likes it, but also because it's inexpensive, refillable, and it's going to last a long time (I've found that Kong toys are really hard to tear up). Having to rotate toys because your cats have grown bored with them can get expensive. This didn't cost a lot and I know it will last for years."

68393,1,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's the nutritional analysis:-100% freeze dried liver-NO additives or preservatives.-Crude protein..... not less than 50%-Crude fat..... not less than 5%-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%-Moisture..... not more than 6%"
64245,0,Well I can't say that this product has made a huge difference in my dogs lives but it has been quite helpful.

94067,1,"Proper set up of this device is crucial. I don't know why, but the company has set up the device backwards... The mechanical filtration is before the biological and chemical filtration. Every other filter system has mechanical filtration before biological and biological before chemical. If you set this up properly, it works GREAT.Also, the picture is a bit deceiving; the filter has to be at the level of the water otherwise it won't work properly. If you place it on the floor it won' t work. I will try to take pictures of mine next time I take it apart for cleaning, but for now it seems to work great.Only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not 5 is because the instructions are retarded. It was kind of a headache to set up, so much so that I almost returned it. Since I figured out how to set it up it has been working great and I am considering buying a second one instead of buying a more expensive larger filter."

182908,2,"I have two cats and i just moved from a large apartment to a smaller one. All of a sudden I was in much closer quarters than I ever wanted with my cats' fecal matter. I realized a traditional litter pan wasn't going to cut it. So I swallowed the large lump in my throat and spent over $120 on this piece of junk, as I rationalized the huge investment in quality of life.And it actually worked great for about 3 hours. Just long enough to get covered in poo and then the door to the fecal receptor stopped closing. Now the pleasant aroma of urine wafts through my tiny apartment at all times.It is LOUD like a tractor trailer truck. It gets stuck often. And the rake really doesn't do an effective job removing all the clumps. One of the cats is scared of it and so he started peeing in my bed.I wish I hadn't wasted so much money on this disgusting, noise machine.[...]"

9990,0,"For those of you writing reviews with it being terrible, I honestly don't have that many problems with it.So for starters, I connected this cage, with a bunch of fun tubes, (I'll add customer pictures) Using the loop-d-loop and just an expansion pack of tubes. Which worked out fantastic. I added this 2 story cage, If you look it up you can simply find it.It is very colorful, and the colors are almost as shown. Maybe just a bit dulled out. In this cage, my hamster who stays in here more often, does not usually use the petting zone, which I was fine with at first. But then, she used the wheel as her nest. Now, I was fine with this, thinking it was adorable to watch her move food. She has a LOT in there. One thing though, when she ever runs on the wheel (worse in the middle of the night) All the food clanks against the wheel SUPER loud, and sometimes, it falls out. (Im not worried about it falling out, I have a vacuum cleaner, and Its not that big of a deal.) The latching cage, I think I have a more advanced version, Looking at the customer photos, mine you have to push down and pull out a little, Its hard to explain, customer photo will be shown. It latches shut, and I have never had a mishap of a hamster getting out. I did once, but my fault on my other cage, leaving the door open. The wheel also does get stuck at some points, in which I have to give it a slight push, but its a design flaw, in which slightly bothers me. If you look closely, there's little dents in it, and it gets stuck. I just got this cage and I bought it from PetSmart. So I'll go through some things:Cleaning: I have yet to clean it, but I had to take it halfway apart and put better bedding in. The other bedding I used, gave them scratches. So, it is pretty easy. I had a small problem with the other one. Its simple, small and easy to clean. Other than the wheel part, but dont expect it to be half good job. Its not gonna cut it. For those of you who pieces are breaking, be more careful. Dont just start ripping and tearing, Be gentle. Take only a few pieces apart, trust me its not that hard.Fun: The fun in this cage is highly amazing. The slide has grips, but the hamsters go up and down. It's cute because sometimes they'll both be on it! Theres food all over it. and I just love seeing them happy! They love the cage, but only Chip one of the hamsters spends more of her time in there.Durability: Its very durable. I have had no problems with it breaking, and I got a little frustrated, and went hard on it, and started forcing pieces together. Still hasn't broken. Maybe you guys have a little bit of bad luck? I honestly don't know, you just need to be more careful. Obviously its gonna break with someone who is tall, dropping it on tile floor. Dont expect it to last. An aquarium will most likely brake just as much.Overall:Cleaning: 8/10Fun: 10/10Durability: 8/10Overall: 9/10"
124336,2,"that also makes it a bit bendable and moveable for those with big dogs that tend to lean against the sides when sitting or laying down. I use it to crate at agility trials and the light color is great on the hot sunny days. My German Shepherd girl got the thing walking around under my tent area just getting excited when I would return or moving around inside.That said, there were excellent instructions permanently attached to the bag it came in. Incredibly lightweight and sets up in a second.Didn't get the quilted pad that supposed to come with it but hopefully the company sends that later (message to company I purchased from).UPDATE! Used it at 2 trials and really not for big dogs. Though there is plenty of room, if you don't stake it down (on a mat or indoors) it can easily go rolling around the area with your dog pushing it around and over. Worse still is the material that makes up the ventilation screening. My GSD literally ripped a 20"" slit in the door screen with one swipe of her paw. Wasn't continuous scratching mind you, one meaninful swipe (with Dremeled nails!). So it no longer will hold that dog in. Though I'm going to try to find some stronger mesh (and someone with a sewing machine) the tent is basically ruined until repaired.So if you have tiny dogs, that never scratch, you are good to go. Otherwise, it was a bit expensive for only 2 uses. Though I love the idea, the light weight, the setup/take down and the large size!"
115155,1,"I have 3 large dogs who drink a lot of water every day, Prior to buying this Bergan dog watered, I just used a very large water dish. During the warmer months, I was filling the bowl easily a half dozen times a day, Our largest dog, a 75lb lab could drink one whole bowl in a sitting when he came inside from playing in the backyard. Our family cat also seems to prefer drinking the water from the dogs bowl rather than his own dish. So no matter how often we were filling their bowl, it was just never enough. Inevitably at some point one of the dogs would come over to get our attention, so to bring us towards their bowls wanting them filled again.When I saw this Bergan dog waterer, I figured if it works, it would be exactly what we needed. I bought the 3 gallon model and have been so glad I did ever since. Now it only needs filled every other day (or so). For a family with smaller dogs, or less of them, this waterer will hold enough water for days probably. It's very simple to use. Simple pop the tank off the back, fill with water, screw the top back onto the tank and make sure the little hold is covered with its cap. Pop tank back into the tray and then reach under to the cap and remove the plug that's covering the water hole. The tank will fill with water and keep it filled with water as your pets drink.At first my dogs were a little confused by the ""glugging"" sounds made by the tank as the water would drain and air bubble would rise inside, but after about 2 days they never cared about it again. Now they will drink and drink even with the tank making the noise as is fills up with air. The dish tray is deep enough that it keeps water from spilling out, but not so deep that small dogs would have an issue drinking out of it. It's quite sill resistant, as I've found from my kids and pets bumping into it time and time again. It stays upright and doesn't leak. If anything ever happened to this one, I wouldn't hesitate at all to pick another one of these up. Highly recommended!"

I loved that my cat acted as if the collar didn't bother her at all, unlike regular collars, she did not scratch at and rip it to shreds after a couple of months. Within about two months of putting the first collar on her, she had worn out the plastic snapping clasp. The second collar did not even last two days after that. I love the collar, but it would be almost perfect if the clasp was the same as the current quick release collars."

I had to pull him out by his bum because I could not unhook the tubing easily enough to pull the tube apart. This product is not appropriate for hamsters other than the very small ones. The product claims it is for hamsters in general and other small animals but in fact it is only good for mice sized animals. Thankfully Amazon allowed for a return and refund.

206734,0,"Pros:1. Reflective strap.2. Always retracts to the stop tab (not the clip)3. Easy to lock and unlock the leash with one finger4. Feels and looks sturdy5. I like that it does not retract all the way to the clip. It makes it easier for me to clip it onto my dog's harness.Cons:1. A little heavy for the amount of leash it holds2. Leash is a little short. It would be just as easy for me to wrap a longer, regular leash around my hand and work it manually.3. Tension is a little too much for my 5LB chihuahua. He ends up pulling against it when walking.4. Wrist strap is nice, but I wish it had an adjustable feature on it. I've had it slip off my hand and scared the heck out of my dog. It was not a pretty sight when I was trying to catch him while he was trying to run away from the clattering of the plastic casing. I now twist it after I put it on my wrist to make it snug.Not sure I'd buy this again. It's nice, but maybe for a slightly larger dog."

After mineral oil, the next ingredient is petroleum. Petroleum isn't mentioned on the tubes I have. As I see it this is not the original formula. My vet said it's not recommended to use petroleum so I have thrown it away. Thanks Sentry for trying but no cigar."

162244,0,"These toys have been a staple in our house for years. If your dog loves to play with a ball as much as a good long two this is a little piece of doggie heaven.We have two Old English Bulldogs a 95 pound six year old, whose always had a Bouncy Bone and his partner in crime a seven month old puppy whose already over 50 pounds. They both adore these but as reviewers have mentioned the treats are gone in a blink of an eye.One of the concerns I've had with the treats themselves is that Rawhide is processed with so many chemicals - including formaldehyde. I make it a point to never buy rawhide.The bone part of the toy is great for easy to moderate chewers but for hardcore, aggressive chewers it's not going to hold up well. Harley our oldest Bulldog reduced his new bone to mere shreds in a few days. The material is no where near as durable as Nylabone especially their Durachew which is about as close to indestructible as you can get.Like all Nylon based chew toys, once they get jagged it's time to throw them away. Nylon can splinter into shards and cause internal damage, but then so can bone and hard rubber. Which we discovered a few years ago when Harley had eaten part of a hard rubber toy and needed emergency surgery as it was blocking his intestines - a close and incredibly scary call.Cotton rope toys like the Booda Rope are really the safest and although they ingest quite a bit, it's non toxic and digests quickly. The other side of the coin is that most dogs lose interest in them pretty quickly, albeit for those games of Tug-O-War.At the end of the day, there's no perfect dog toy, and supervision is everything.The Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone packs a tremendous amount of ""Fun Power"" and our dogs love them. I wish they would hold up better and replace the treat with a healthier alternative."

215924,2,"I ordered this particular feeder because of the soft access closures, helping to prevent bees/insects from getting inside it. But the bowl on this feeder is so shallow, that even the weight of an oriole on one side or any breeze tips it, causing the nectar to leak out. Also, the feeder never hangs straight, and the hanging hook has to be unscrewed from the base to remove the lid to clean it. I can slide the lid up the hook to add nectar, but it takes two hands and cannot be done without spilling the contents in the feeder. Other feeders I have allow the lid to be removed over the hook (larger hole in the lid)."

I had half a mind to send it back but i loath on-line returns and procedures so i said I'll just put it somewhere that i won't be able to see it all the time so it won't bother me.I've bought 3 different types of bag brands and sizes and they all do not fit properly. Big problem!! None sit properly, fit right...You CANNOT lift the whole thing from the top because it doesn't actually clasp together shut so if you want to actually move it you need to carry it from the bottom! Where as with my old one, i just grabbed the handle took it to the bathroom cleaned/washed/and changed it all up and put it back!And my last complaint for the evening is going to be the actual inside layout/design were the litter goes...............................OMG.....Yes, you save tons of litter because it doesn't need/take as much as the normal rectangular ones but to actually get a good scoop will take you at least double if not more time than cleaning your normal litter box.NO do not buy! No i do not recommend! No i would never buy again!"

161543,1,"I bought this to try and keep my dog from wandering away from home, or to call her back if she does. Tried it two days and it didn't seem effective. So the third day I spent $660 getting my invisible fence up and running, and buying a new control collar. I didn't really want to do this as the fence and collar control the dog by pain and fear.Of course, as luck would have it she caught on by the third day that the sound of this clicker was ALWAYS associated with a waiting treat! Now she stays nearby, and looks with anticipation at my right pocket. Often I reward her with a click and a treat for just being good and staying in our yard. The clicker is quite small, not even visible in a ladies pants pocket. I just press against my pocket to make it click, so that is easy. Problem is... for a few days now it's disappeared into a pocket somewhere in the house!But the training seems to have formed a habit for her, so I really don't need it as much if at all."

Much easier to get on than a pinch collar and works better too, without harming the dog. He shook his head for a minute but once we got walking it didn't bother him and he didn't pull at all. He walked by our side.No more sniffing everything along the way either!The large fit him & he does have the large Rott head.This thing rocks."

75510,0,"Recently I bought an Aspects bird feeder that was made in the USA. This Heritage Farms feeder is made in China. By hanging this feeder I am asking the local birds to go from the Aspects penthouse to the Heritage Farms outhouse. The difference in the quality between these two feeders is astonishing. I have previously reviewed the Aspests feeder so I won't go into that again. This Heritage Farms feeder has an overall rinky dinkyness to it. It is easy to fill and has a large capacity. That is the positive side. Unfortunately, the material used for construction is guaranteed to rust. Calling it squirrel proof is a complete farce. I hung the feeder from a large tree branch using the hook provided for this purpose. It took only a few minutes for the squirrels to solve the minor access problem. They kept grinning at me while gorging themselves. I had to move the feeder to a pole that is actually squirrel proof in order for the birds to have a chance at the food.I am new to the bird watching game but it is an interesting learning process. One of the major lessons I have now learned is how to purchase a quality feeder. First thing to do is conduct a search for ""made in the USA bird feeders"". After spotting a likeable candidate go to Amazon and see if it is available for purchase from them. There is no guarantee that every single bird feeder made in the USA is of top quality but the odds are in your favor. Aspects is an example of a top quality manufacturer. I am sure there are others."

23012,0,"This thing takes off so much fur it is unbelievable. However, there are pros and cons to this device,Pros:- Clears cats of pretty much all shedding fur (if you can get them to sit for a brushing with the furminator long enough).Cons:- Tool does not capture said fur very well. Expect a big furry mess wherever you are using the tool. I capture the fur in my hand and roll it up and put it aside in a pile or in a dish when I can.- My two cats, at least, HATE the way the tool feels on their bodies. I have to chase them around with it and switch between the brush they do like and this one. One stroke with the brush they like (a many-pronged metal brush)to one stroke furminator. They still almost always run off after a few strokes with the furminator and I do try to be gentle with it on them. Once in a while I can get them to relax for the furminator, which is usually when I am cuddling with them in my bed. Since this tool pulls fur out with no capture mechanism it just goes everywhere on my bed. Then I have to defur the BED.This being said, I am glad I have the tool as it clears way more fur than the standard brush. I just wish they could somehow make it gentler feeling for the cats and figure out some way to keep the fur that is displaced in the brush until I remove it. I would gladly accept a little less efficiency for more comfort for them because then I would be able to get them to enjoy it, thus making it easier for me to use.So, there is definitely a trade off here.My cats love being brushed but they HATE the furminator.I wish they didn't hate it because I love it.Tip: A few good strokes with the furminator will release a lot of fur which can then be brushed out with another brush if you can time it right!"
41425,1,"These antennas are pretty rugged, but it turns out they can break, and always at the worst possible time. This is, by all indications, an OEM part that's good to have in the travel bag so you your sportDOG controller will still work if you manage to have one of those field catastrophes that takes out the old one. [I use an SD-2500 on a &lt;1yr old weimaraner pup, so I can't afford to be out of control in the field for even a minute. Not to belabor the point, but especially if you train pointing dogs, you ought to have some spare parts for your training equipment]"

This was also replaced right away. The second one was better.The dog has reacted well to the training as called out in the instructions. This is my 3rd week and I think this is going to work wellAlthough there was some significant quality problems in the beginning, the company reacted well and replaced the items quickly."

61171,0,"I'm giving this 3 stars because what you see in the photo and what you get are not the same. I ordered the Sherpa for my dog and didn't get it. Okay - there wasn't any price difference so I didn't get upset there so I kept the bed. But - look at the photo. The bed looks plump all around like a donut. The bed I received for my dog is not. It just sort of keels over. No matter what side I flip it on to. Yes, my dog will sleep on it - but I feel the bed is overrated."
89271,2,"I really wanted to like this collar for 2 reasons: it's rechargeable, it's lightweight. Unfortunately, the shock doesn't work when my dog barks. I repositioned it many times, still didn't work. I shaved the hair on my dog's neck, still didn't work. The collar only weighs 2-3 ounces, so that was a huge plus for me, because my 13 lb maltese couldn't wear a heavier collar.I also purchased the SportDOG Rechargeable NoBark 10R Bark Control Collar but it was WAY TOO HEAVY. It weighed 4.8 ounces and it was made of heavy plastic and heavy metal. That's just too cruel to make a small dog wear something so heavy around his neck all day. Just for comparison, I am listing the weights of the most popular collars:PetSafe no bark collar. 2.3 ozInnotek no bark 2.4 or 3 oz depending on what website you look atDogtra no bark collar 4 oz.Sport Dog no bark 10R 4.8 ozThe problem is that most lightweight collars require batteries and you have to keep replacing the batteries like crazy. That's why i wanted a rechargeable one. I've returned all of the collars and am still searching for one. Too bad!"

50986,0,"i have not bought this item i got the glass half gallon bowl, its not big enough for many fish, but its big enough for malaysian trumpet snails, thats what i put in mine. you may have to buy online, most places dont have them because theyre notorious for taking over tanks and multiplying, the aquarium i got mine from was trying to get rid of them so they gave em to me. but they're one of the easiest things i know of to take care of. they can live in 50-90 degree water, it doesn't really matter if you want 5 or 50 of them for a tank this small, they'll multiply and fill it if you give them enough food. they eat algae so all you need is to put the bowl under a light or put in algae wafers. their tough to kill, more resilient than most tiny aquatic creatures, and its best to put them on their own, they will multiply with food and theres not many fish that will eat even the babies. im gonna use the siphon and pump of a tetra 3i whisper filter and a sponge to make a sponge filter for it, although it will probably be more of a gravel vac because it takes up a lot of room in a tank this small, it'll take care of that debris though, these guys are dirtier in numbers. hope i helped"
181354,1,"This bed is awesome! My dog spends the majority of his day outside while I'm at work, because he can't be trusted. Purchasing this bed to be utilized with his dog house has made for a comfy environment while I'm gone. He loves it and I don't feel guilty leaving him outside for a bit. The bed is very safe, easy to clean, and simple to use. A must have for outdoor dogs!"

58716,1,"I adopted a puppy who is determined to eat his own poop (disgusting!). I tried putting things like pineapple juice on his food but that didn't seem to work, it made his food sticky and I guess i didn't get enough to keep him from eating. These work pretty well, when I give them to him religiously (he's small so 1 tablet was enough for the initial treatment and I also use that for continuing) he is not very interested in his poop. When i forget to give them to him for a few days he's eating it again. One thing it doesn't seem to work is outside, if I ever miss any of his poop to clean it up he'll find it and eat that but I think that might be more to get a reaction from me as I try to get it away from him. But he's much less interested so I find that to be a success."
34996,0,Same problem as everyone else. The bars do not stay in place once tightened. I placed them where I wanted them and then wrapped black electrical tape around the bottom of the bars on the posts to keep them from sliding down. Great for the price but wasn't sure I had put it together right because it kept falling apart before I got it in the car. There are better ones out there that I would recommend if you are going to use this often. I will only use it once in awhile to take the dog on a trip or to the vet. I have a 2011 outback so I can tell you that it fits in there. Should fit in most vehicles. You just might have to make some manual adjustments to it.
149116,2,"I bought 2 of these because a family member had tried them in the past and had success. Not the case for me! It didn't attract or catch a single flea! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it caught a few flies and gnats. If you're looking for something to help lower your flea population, look elsewhere!"
182818,0,"In response to an earlier posting, yes, this box leaves a lot of mess behind and around the box. My little plastic waste boxes fill up within a few days, and now I need more! I've only had it for a couple of weeks now. I have; however, found a great alternative ""mix"" for the litter problem. Most people have a hard time finding a good litter that is inexpensive. If you're worried about cost and keeping chemicals and dust LOW, pick up some cedar litter (fine -not chips) or wheat litter, and a fine but inexpensive clumping litter and mix them together to create a special mix. I even use crystals occasionally- eventhough it says not to- I've never had a problem doing so. This mix goes a LONG way and it is SAFE for your cats! The rake will stick less too with the wheat or cedar and help keep the odor down."
17642,0,"While this anti-bark collar works well-- my Yorkie no longer yaps-- there are some definite drawbacks:1) Settings-- there are none, so I cannot adjust the noise level my dog can make. This unit sprays even when he sneezes or yawns.2) Sprays even in off position-- when I turn the collar off, but leave it on the dog, for instance when I am training him and barking is encouraged (such as 'speak') or mild growling during playtime-- the collar will still spray a few times. I have even turned it off and put it on my neck and have been sprayed myself.3) Random sprays-- sometimes my dog would just be sitting there, licking his paws or something and I would hear the collar spray two or three times in a row very quickly, but he made no noise whatsoever. This only happened twice that I witnessed.Like I said, this collar absolutely helped my dog stop barking. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. It is much more humane than shock collars-- even if this unit malfunctions, it is just a nuisance, not a painful torture session. It is also very inexpensive compared to other models on the market. While the setbacks listed above are definitely irritating, I still believe this unit was a good choice for me and my pup. I would recommend a more expensive higher quality collar if you able, but this unit will do as it claims if you just need a cheap quick fix and do not mind it's 'spray-happy' characteristics."
132540,1,I like this i have not tried it out on a dog yet because i havent got mine yet. Good feel robust great for the price and i cant even hear it. The one down side is that it doesn't come with batteries and the batterie it uses is a 9 volt alkaline so not your usual 2 double A's.
159868,0,My chocolate lab loves this ball. He carries it around the house and likes to make it squeak as he is carrying it. Makes us laugh that's for sure!Only thing is that the squeaker falls into the ball after a very short time. This works for me as my husband not too crazy about the squeaking.Good news is the dog still likes it because the air from the squeaker hole makes a noise and the size is perfect for him. He is a very active playful dog and this will keep him busy for a while.He does rip these up though will say its tough enough to last longer than any other squeaky toy.Will buy again.
77294,1,This is a great product for families initiating puppy crate training or would like to crate small dogs while away. We bought two to create a larger training area for our puppy. The product is very easy to assemble and take apart for area cleaning. The plastic is durable and will hold up to puppy chewing instincts. Multiple panels that lock together allow flexibility of size and shape as the puppy grows.I would highly recommend this product.
40473,0,First of all i couldn't get the screw to come out so i had to get a hammer and brake it open it wouldn't open up with a screw driver and you needed to charged it like every 5 minutes but at lest my cat was happy with all the work we did to make her happy should you buy this?:No. I make a big mistake buying this and now im wind up with it
94142,0,"I've been running this filter for two weeks in a 20g tank with a small turtle. It is easy to set up, but I am not thrilled by how it keeps the water in the tank. There just isn't enough water flow, so you wind up having to dis-attach the upflow just to clean out the places in the tank where waste accumulates. I like it better than all the in tank options I've tried, though. It's a lot like a Rena XP3 (which I have on a bigger tank). I just wish it had a little more of its power."
123418,1,"Being a first time dog groomer that was tired of paying about $100 for both of my Maltese's to get a hair cut every month or so, I bought an Andis cutter. The reviews were great and it came with the #10 blade (which is the generic catch all size). The results were horrible, uneven, and I ended up doing a hand cut with siscors. They were trimmed, but obviously not professional. I ended up talking with a dog groomer friend who replied to my story, ""Let me guess, you are using a #10 blade."" I affirmed. She then said maltese's have a very fine hair that the #10 blade was too big and I needed to go to a #40. So I bought this one. Works great, and definately cuts Maltese fur well, except the standard combs that attach don't fit. You need to purchase a special type. They are on Amazon from a 3rd party vendor, but are twice the price of the same things on the Andis website. Look for part #'s 12990 and/or 12860. The normal blades fall off and well lets just say that my maltese has a 7 inch bald spot on his back. The aboe part numbers fit and will not let that happen."
198868,0,"I just received my pet a roo carrier and I have mixed feelings. I bought the Medium size based on other reviews I read (thank you!) and I'm glad I did. The size small would have been way too tiny for my Yorkies. My 6 lb. Yorkie fits comfortably and so far loves to be in the carrier. My 10 lb. Yorkie was not as thrilled. He had a hard time laying down in the carrier, and with his paws out over the top - I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable having him in there without supporting him...making it not so hands free. The harness clip does help, and my guess is that he'll settle in eventually. We plan to use it mostly when we travel so that we can have hands free at the airport! I'm still hopeful. It would be nice if they made a ""Large"" size. I think that would give people more options, especially since they run small. We could probably even fit both our pups in, which would be super. Oh - and in case you're wondering how it'll stay on your back (I sure was), the directions are to cross the straps on your back. It fits snugly and the straps allow for customizable comfort. Overall, I'm glad I purchased."

71095,0,"Well, when we got our dog Valentine as a Valentine's Day Surprise, the next day we rushed to PETCO and they told us that a healthy food would be Wellness and Blue. We got Blue dry food and Wellness canned food. Our dog ate Wellness for a month and a half, and them she didn't really want to eat it anymore, sniff and walk away. The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option. We ended up giving the food and treats to our neighbor and owner of Valentine's brother, and that dog will eat ANYTHING, so at least the food didn't go to waste."
55146,1,"I got this for my two cats, one who has pica and chews everything all the time and the other who is lazy and fat. I thought it might be a good idea to make them work for their food. This little ball gives them such a fun time! It is super easy for me to open and pour food into and then I roll it across the floor to get their attention...it doesn't take long! I truly think they actually prefer me putting their kibble in this instead of in their bowl now. I actually bought another one from a pet store that has a weight in the bottom so it's a bit more work, and they don't play with that one as much. I love it!"
196765,2,"The collar does actually stop my dog's barking after about 2 barks BUT it also will go off frequently when she is not barking (I even taped up her tags so they wouldn't jingle as per packaging instructions). It's loud and incredibly annoying to humans too and in the car it's even worse, frequently going off over every bump or something seemingly randomly. In the 5 minutes stretch from my apartment to work it goes off 8-10 times AND possibly the worst part is that it has no off button!! You have to use a coin to unscrew the battery and physically take it out if you want it to stop. Also annoying is that is comes with an ugly bright orange nylon collar and it's extremely difficult to find a regular collar that will fit the attachment on it. If it wasn't as loud to humans, as sensitive to EVERYTHING, and, if at the very least it had an off switch I'd actually give it 4 stars but as it is, it's barely worth it for the hassle."
189408,0,"I ordered this bowl to feed the neighborhood feral cats which roam my neighborhood. My previous bowl kept being carried off by the neighbors dog. I thought this bowl would be a heavier weighted material which would prevent its being &#34;kidnapped&#34;, however, after three days I found it in the neighbors yard where the dog had drug it. It is a nice bowl if you are wanting something for your pet inside the house. For outside, I think I will stick to ceramic!"

56641,0,"It was not what I was hoping for. The probes were longer than the original probes, but not near long enough to get through the fur on my chow.

131225,0,"My cat absolutely loved this toy. I got it for him for Christmas and with in a few months he had ripped the butt open by kicking his back claws into it when he played. Around then we got a lab puppy. We tried to keep the cat toy away from him, but one day when I wasn't looking he got ahold of it. Inside the mouse is a bag of small rocks he ripped apart the bag and got it all over the carpet and digested a lot of it. Ergo, if you have a dog that would be semi interested in this toy be advised of the potential hazard inside. Other wise it's my cats favorite toy, even tho it didn't last very long."

70385,0,"The smell is noticeably strong/perfume-like when you lather (not so much after the bath, which is good), but I prefer more subtle smells. It's very thick and takes a while to rinse off compared to other conditioners. When my dog dried off, he looked stringy because some of the conditioner had not fully washed off (oops). I used Top Paw Oatmeal conditioner before trying this one, and I prefer Top Paw."
143085,2,"I owned the older version of the LitterMaid for several years and it gave out when the cord lost its elasticity and kept wrapping itself around the rake. I replaced it with the newest version and it was a disaster. First, the rake barely got past the rim of the waste tray so half the waste ended up in the tray and the other half fell back into the box. Then it wouldn't even get as far as the tray itself. After two weeks, I replaced the unit with another one. The rake on this one can barely make it through clean litter. When there is waste in the box, it grinds to a halt about half way through the cycle and doesn't even come close to getting as far as the dump tray. This purchase was a total waste of money. It is woefully underpowered. I have one cat so my problems are not from overuse."
9309,0,"As everyone has noted, this door is very difficult to install. My package didn't even come with instructions. So, I went online and found an instructional video on the company's website.

I did it by myself, after much cursing and....well you get the idea. We'll see how it holds up."

107013,0,I love the stroller...the only complaint I have is that there is no attachment within the stroller to secure the dog by leash or harness.

87258,0,"I am on my third bottle and third month and it does seem to be helping. My 12-year-old dog (70 lb brindle mutt) has been having sore legs or hips, especially going up and down stairs and in and out of the car. The vet recommended these during his last check-up.The bottle prescribes three pills daily for a dog this size, so a bottle will last about a month. In about a week he did seem somewhat better - since then, he seems about the same. On days that he is active (he goes out to the park with a play group of younger dogs) I will sometimes give him a double dose as I am sure he has overdone it.He does like the taste, which is good as it would be a pain to try and pulverize them into his food.I recommend these, but expect modest improvement within a week, not necessarily drastic results. I haven't tried other brands yet so cannot compare.-karen takatani"

196732,0,"I have two beagles about 4 years old, they are notorious barkers. I adopted them about a year ago and was living in an area with alot of land and no immeadiate neighboors but have since had to move to a ""normal"" neighborhood. I decided to try this to see if it could help them learn to curb their vocal wake up calls. It has only been three days and it is really working pretty well, I know we are all still in the learning phase. My one dog will bark 1-2 times and then is usally quiet, even if he catches a scent this interupts his barking pattern and with in a few minuets he will stop barking. My other dog seems a bit smater. She has only barked 2 barks in a row about twice when wearing the collor before she is quiet. I will admit that they do sometimes go off at random, especially if my dogs shake, and today I had them in the car and they would go off when I went over big bumps. So if you have a dog that barks in the car or is kind of jumpy then the vibration might set off the collar as opposed to their barking. Hopefully they will continue to learn and soon the barking will be no more. Good luck to you all. I would say this is worth trying over shock collars first. It deffinetly seems the most mild, and I think it would work really well on dogs that are skitish of loud noises (like mine)."

104156,0,"We have two pets that are dogs, two that are cats and perhaps that was too much to expect of this little device. It is made as two screen frames. The outer frame surrounds a hole cut to fit it in the screen door, It installs in a straightforward fashion, the screen of the door is bound to the frame with rubber inserts, around its edges. The inner door is a frame for the piece of screen cut from the door of the home for the opening made for the outer frame. When all is complete you have a frame within a frame that is lockable with pins in the bottom of the inner frame but when not locked the inner door swings on hinges that connect it to the outer frame at the top. The little door lasted one day and then it began to be removed by the heavier of our two dogs, a chihuahua weighing in at 12#. In a week he had removed it from the screen door where it sits a bit forlorn next to the screen door that was also destroyed in the process.This little door should be used only in situations where the animals using it are not the type to attempt to wreck things that restrain their ingress or egress. In any case I won't use the locks again if it is reinstalled."

215597,2,"I am giving this product 2 stars (instead of 1) because it did a fine job and I liked the smell. If you are not very concerned about the ingredients in your dog shampoo, you may love this one. Unfortunately, I was looking for a natural shampoo for my dog, and since the ingredients list for this product was deceptive, I unknowingly bought it.The list of ingredients on the bottle (and on the internet) is: Coconut shampoo base, aloe vera gel, essence of lavender, essence of mint, chamomile extract, sage extract, nettles extract, rosemary extract, wheat protein extract (natural deodorizing agent), tea tree oil, vitamin E, vitamin C.I e-mailed the company and asked for the list of ingredients in the ""coconut shampoo base"" and received the following: deionized water, cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), aloe extract, glycerin.On the Skin Deep Database (you can Google that) cocamidopropyl betaine has a hazard score of 5 (out of 10, with 10 being the most hazardous). The database says ""Cocamidopropyl betaine is a synthetic surfactant; it has been associated with irritation and allergic contact dermatitis, reactions that could be due to the ingredient itself or to impurities present in it, such as 3-dimethylaminopropylamine.""While this hazard score is determined based on humans, it's my hands that are washing my dog, and also my children's hands which are all over him afterward. I do not consider this product to be natural or healthy, and not listing all of the ingredients on the label seems to me deceptive on the part of Cloud Star."

118065,1,"After a few sessions, my shepherd let me use the shredder on her. She did not experience any outward unpleasant response to it. Quite a bit soft undercoat was obtained. She has a medium length coat that does not appear to be shedded from her, but the undercoat brought out a lot. I recommend using this product if you have a shepherd. She didn't appear to be needing brushing, but the undercoat was a mystery to me until now."
112520,2,"This unit works great.. for a couple of months. I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog."

182979,2,"I still can't believe that I wasted so much money on this piece of junk. The first one I had received wouldn't ever shut off. Once it was replaced with a new one, the cat poop and litter kept getting stuck in the rake, litter would be everywhere but in the receptacle and I was cleaning up an even bigger mess then the original $10 litter box. Stupid me also bought the privacy tent that was cumbersome and got stained way too easily and extra receptacles which I'm probably going to end up throwing away. What a huge disappointment this whole experience has been for me and my family."
155259,0,I bought this item with my Visa debit card. The money cleared and was taken out of my account but somehow my order went into a collections agency called TRS. They called me at home and then hung up on me. I thought it was a scam but they were calling me to collect on a bill from Amazon.com! Now I call Amazon and TRS and both are telling me I have an outstanding collection notice. This has take an hour out of my day and it still hasn't been cleared up. AND I've already paid for the item. Buy this elsewhere preferably at a local pet store support your local business!! Amazon is a behemoth with terrible customer service.
206695,2,"The small, fit in your palm lead seemed like a good idea when I bought it. However, I find it akward to hold - keeping my hand closed around the zip housing takes a bit getting use to - I'm use to the more traditional bigger retractables where my hand grips a 'handle'. It's not comfortable to put my hand thru the loop and let it hang. The locking mechanism isn't very consistent - doesn't lock every time- so I don't feel confident walking my dog when I need to keep a short lead. I won't purchase this product in the future."
133323,2,"I purchased the carier after measuring my dog and the carrier was not as big as they say it is. My dog is only 11 pounds and it says the description say it fits dogs up to 20 pounds. It is a sturdy carrier though and it was very easy to put together. My dog could not sit properly or turn around. It was clearly misrepresented but I purchased the Cayman 2 and it was perfect. If you have a very small or short dog, this carrier works. I would reccomend that you do measure your dog and purchase the next size up. It is airine approved which is great but all in all I have to give it two stars because it was not the size or demensions the description provides."
66421,1,"I've only had the collar for a week and only now had the chance to use it in the field ... all I can say is WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I should say that my dog already knew basic commands like ""Come"", ""Sit"", ""Stay"", ""Heel"", and ""Down"" but getting him to do those things off-lease was a real challenge. With the radio collar, things are a snap. Games of fetch are now actually fun for both of us. He used to run after the ball, catch it, but then proceed to not come back with it. Prompts of treats didn't help past the first one or two throws. After only two ""tickles"" on the lowest setting (and we really are talking a ""tickle"" here ... I tested it on myself and the lowest setting is far less than you might get from a shock from walking on synthetic or wook carpeting), he now makes a bee line back to me after only getting the tone prompt. With only one tickle at the lowest setting, he's even heeling off lease as we walk home from throwing the ball. Truly ... if you have a dog who already knows basic commands and you'd like to be able to take him off-lease for games (or hunting as the product description states) this is a wonderful product. This is not a substitute for training but is a very effective supplement to it. All my dog needed was the reinforcement that I meant the commands I was giving him even off-lease.An additional kudos to the Petsafe company ... the originally shipped transmitter (the part that looks like a little FRS radio) was defective making the set essentially useless. One call to Petsafe and they replaced the transmitter with a new one with no problelm."
195483,2,"The product description didn't specify how long the tug rope is, but I was assuming it'd be more than 3 feet long. Wrong! I found that to be uncomfortably short for my hyper lab puppy. He's still learning his manners, and sometimes when excited playing tug of war he'll quickly let go and grab on again further up the rope to get a better grip and with this toy my hand was uncomfortably close to his sharp puppy teeth!I say stay away from this and get a longer tug toy unless you have a dog that is an experienced tugger and will reliably grab on to only the very end of a rope even when excited."

I had tried the nightlite + a dish of water method and while it worked for a while, the water always got spilled or dried out.I plugged Flea Trap in, found it gave out a nice non-disturbing light, I thought, yeah, I can live with this in my bedroom. Within 2 hours, the bulb was burned out. Replaced the bulb with a new one, within an hour, that bulb burnt out. Tried with a third bulb, same result. Each time, the bulb burnt out dramatically, with a black cast on the glass. I'm not going to try again.Oh, and also, while it was set up near my pet's area (with a burned out bulb), his tail hair managed to get stuck on the adhesive. Scared him."
16003,2,I purchased the RSC UL-275BM receiver in August 2011 and the battery light began flashing after a few days. Tried to reset battery as per Petsafe instructions and started blinking again after a few days. Sent receiver back to Petsafe and they quickly issued a new one. SAME ISSUE with the replacement so waiting to here what Petsafe is going to do about it now. I think there is a manufacturing defect with this collar; my other 2 collars (not RSC UL-275BM) work fine. Very Frustrating!
152388,0,"As soon as I opened the package, I realized that I had ignored a fundamental key to these diapers - the tail helps hold them on - and if you have Boxers like I do, or other crop tailed breeds, well, it's pretty much not going to stay on. It will depend, of course, on how much ""stub"" your dog has. My female boxer was cropped very close and she hardly has a stub at all.It was my own fault for being oblivious to that obvious fact - but wanted to write a review to make others aware of what I overlooked: NO TAIL - WON'T STAY ON!"

151749,2,"I just purchased this for my cat who likes to chew on everything in my house, including furniture. I am always looking for sturdy, ""chewable"" toys that can withstand his gnawing and that he can't swallow. In the past he has ripped open almost every catnip toy I have purchased, so I thought this one might be different. The description is very sparse and led me to believe that it was a ""crunchy"" toy--I thought there would be a long catnip stalk (catnip can come in a cinnamon like consistency) or some other hard material, but alas this is a soft cat toy like all the others: made of cloth, filled with ground catnip, and decorated with ribbons. What's worse is that there are two in a package and one of them is barely two inches long, and could be easily swallowed by an excited cat. I would not really recommend these toys at all, but if you are just looking for a small catnip toy, the larger one in the package is fine for that, but it doesn't seem worth the cost for both."

73737,0,"I bought this same tank from Walmart a while back. There are a few places where there is room for improvement. First of all the pump sort of/barely worked for a long time and then stopped making bubbles but kept the noise. One of my smaller fish found a way into the plastic tube that goes around the air stone, I saw she was missing just by chance and rescued her. The light is too bright for the fish, at least for any length of time. Every time I turned it on it freaked them out so they hid. But I'd say that the BIGGEST problem is that you can barely see the fish because of the way it's shaped. you have to be close or the fish have to be in just the right position. Not dreadful, but I went back to a bowl."
13664,1,"These pads are good. They absorb well and have not leaked through for me. The one thing I don't like about them is the way they are folded. Sounds silly, but I have to unfold one every time my dog needs a new one. The way they're folded makes the pad stick to itself really strangely and makes unfolding harder than it should be.I also didn't like that these pads were shipped to me in the wee wee pad box. A little more discretion would have been nice."

131895,2,"My cat had a bladder infection and certain areas of the carpet had been soaked with cat urine before be discovered her infection. I read the reviews of many products and decided to try two based on the reviews. Unfortunately, ended up purchasing at least two bottles of the STINK FREE Urine Odor Remover for Cat Urine. I followed the directions and ended up using two full bottles on two areas of the carpet. It did not work as I had hoped. It did take some of the odor out, but not all. The product may be good for smaller areas that are not completely soaked. I am not certain, because this is not how I used it. This is why I gave it two stars over one star. As I stated it did take away some of the odor but did not remove all and did not remove any of the stain. Buy at your own risk. I hope this is helpful."
169433,1,"After a $100 shock collar and $50 in batteries, we gave up on getting our Yorkie to ""be quiet."" I read about the face wrap on a message board and figured, if it doesn't work, it costs us less than $10.Our Yorkie barks at everything - a hanging umbrella on a doorknob to neighbors across the street getting out of their car. I was surprised that the barking stopped for these mild occurrences. I don't know if the face wrapped ""calmed"" her or if it just made it harder to bark. She doesn't try to get the face wrap off; however, she lays down wherever she is and doesn't move. She may follow me to another room, while the wrap is still on - but she lays on the floor (almost motionless).If you have a dog that barks when someone comes to your house, I would suggest placing the wrap on prior to the person's arrival. The wrap doesn't seem to stop the barking when a stranger/friend enters the home. I believe our dog may feel threatened or overly excited because someone she knows is entering the house. This behavior is quite different from what I stated in the paragraph above.I give a five star rating because it works better than a shock collar. The face wrap works for on the everyday occurrences such as the ones mentioned above. This is what we were seeking in a bark-control system. We found our solution - the calming face wrap."
41143,0,"I bought one small bottle of this for my dog to see if it would help his itchy skin, and found that it added way too many calories to his food since you have to use so much. I cut back on his kibble to compensate, but I didn't want to withhold too much since oil doesn't really fill the belly. My dog is a 65 lb. active dog, but he still gained a couple pounds due to the addition of this oil, despite my cutting down his kibble.If you use this salmon oil in the prescribed amounts, it'll cost you an arm and leg, too. You might as well switch to a really high quality kibble, which can do just as much to improve the quality of your dog's coat.I did not notice that this salmon oil stopped my dog's itching but it did seem to make him shed less. Of course, he also really enjoyed the taste."
70200,0,"I have 2 gerbils named Acorn an Daisy (I wrote the other review where I said about them). I wrote a good review about this potty before but now I don't like it as much. When we first got it they chewed the clear part on the top. They chewed a big chunk off (It was all that was left of the clear part). Then Daisy tried to pull it down a tube because we put it in the Petting Zone. It was way too big to fit down. We took the clear part out so the gerbils wouldn't cut themselves. Then they chewed the other part so much the litter wouldn't stay in. We bought a new potty for them, and they've started to chew it up. They should've made these out of something else that gerbils can't chew!"

132707,2,"This item has no ON/OFF switch, and as soon as the battery was installed, it made a loud 'pop' which apparently indicated that it blew out the device, since it is not working. Tried a second battery, just to be sure if the first one (fresh package of batteries we bought SPECIFICALLY to use with this) might have been dead, but aside from making the same loud 'pop', the device remained completely dead. There is an LED light on the device, which is apparently supposed to light up to indicate that the device worked when the button is pushed, but it has never lit on any of the occasions when I have pushed the button, and if the device makes any sound, my dogs don't hear it. Most annoying part is that I cannot find the packaging to return it."

106360,2,"It's a great fit for the corner of my bunnies cage, BUT is not very durable at all! The little knobs on the hanging attachments wear and break off very easily, and all my bunnie does is rest her paws sometimes on the front while eating. I wish they sold replacement parts, or better yet made the attaching parts out of metal so they would'nt break off. Once the dish is down it's useless since it tips over easily, the only way to fix it is to buy a new dish and gauranteed it will do the same. I really like the way it saves space by being a corner feeder, but it's attaching design is the PITS and needs to be improved on!!! I am looking for another dish to replace it with."

54525,0,I know these are supposed to for dogs but I saw that cats like them too. Mine did but one day he just nuzzeled one and didn't eat it. It sat there in his bowl for three days before I threw it out. He likes them fresh from the box and if they are not eaten he won't touch it the next day. Its not like it gets stale i would thnk. They are a bit chunky for them and they need to chew into smaller pieces before swallowing. they are hard to break into smaller bits. They have a bit of a foul smell too --- not like a salmon smelll which I'm fine with. This is more like a dry bloody odor that isn't too much fun to work with .

12840,2,"I tried the SuperPet cages with ferrets and rats. While SuperPet models do offer a ton of space for your fuzzies, the design is just not user-friendly. The doors are very small and it can be tough getting access to all of your food dishes, hanging toys, and critters. The shelves have a little groove on the inside which tends to collect urine, kibble, and water. They do not unhook from the cage easily, so unless you wipe everything down before pulling it out, you're likely to scatter yuckiness everywhere.The cages are very heavy and awkward. Yes, you can unhook them from the bottom and clean them as two separate pieces, but getting both to a bathroom or outside for cleaning can be a real chore. They do offer a lot of customization possibilities, but the difficulty of moving things around and putting things back in after a cleaning are just not worth it. I'd rather get a Ferret Nation or a Martin's."

This should have broken the life cylcle but it has not. The Capstar kills the adult fleas, but the Frontline, Program, and Advantage are having no effect on the fleas. We've retreated the yard and house several times and even had an exterminator come out and spray, but still our cats and dog are loaded with fleas. Every other day I'm covering them with flea spray and even then the fleas don't die immediately. Even drowning them doesn't seem to work as I've seen them climbing out of the sink drain after I picked them off the cats and thought I'd washed them away! The products we are using in the yard and house have an growth regulator and this combined with the Program and topical flea product should not allow these things to continue to reproduce but the products are clearly not working.

168961,0,"We use this as part of a preventative plan. We have 3 dogs and one cat that are all indoor/outdoor. We started using this product back in April 2011 as part of a flea prevention plan.

We use the spray about once a week during the hot months (which in San Antonio was 9 months out of the year). We spray the pets bedding, the area rug on our wood floors and our chenille sofas (which we bought before we had dogs and hope to change out with leather for Christmas).If we actually see a flea or our groomer finds them on the dogs then all the pet beds and sofa pillows and cushions get taken out to the porch and given a generous spraying ofSentryHOME Flea and Tick Home and Carpet Spray 96-Fluid Ounceand the carpets get a dusting of flea carpet sprinkle after the spray dries.Use some of the home and carpet spray to saturate a cotton ball and put inside your vacuum bag or keep a flea collar in the bag to kill any fleas that get sucked up. They can get out. It is best to take your vacuum outside and empty the bag (or cylinder as we have a Dyson) and seal it in a garbage back and take directly to the trash. Put the cotton ball or flea collar in the vacuum before taking it back in the house. Cotton balls should be changed every time you vacuum, flea collars can be reused for about 6 months and are also a good preventative measure."

119,1,"I won't rant and rave about the benefits and drawbacks of using a headcollar - each dog is different and responds differently to various training tools, and I'm assuming that you've found this product based off your own research and recommendations from trainers and friends.The hard part is deciding which headcollar type to use. In the past decade, I've used several different headcollars, including the Halti, the Gentle Leader, the Petmate AKC Headcollar, and the Holt. In my opinion, the Holt is the sturdiest, most comfortable, and most flexible headcollar of the whole bunch, and is a worthy successor to my previous favorite, the Halti.The Company Of Animals Halti Head Halter Black Size Halti Head Halter Black Sz 0 Training & Behavioral AidsThe Halti was, previously, the best halter for a very simple reason: it had side-straps on either side of the dog's face that prevented the noseband from riding up a dog's face and digging into the dog's eyes. It also worked without cinching the dog's mouth shut, like the Gentle Leader. However, the noseband was not padded, and while I made my own homemade padding for the noseband, it was at least very wide to prevent the material from biting into the dog's skin (unlike the Gentle Leader). The Halti generally came only in black, though colors could be found online. The Halti, despite being designed to function loose (and allowing a dog the full use of its mouth), often made your dog look ""vicious"" by wearing a ""muzzle"", particularly in the black color. Prior to the holt, this was the most comfortable.HALTI PROS: comfort, looseness, prevents noseband from riding up, safety buckle connects to collarHALTI CONS: limited colors, no padded noseband, can not be cinched tight for short-nose breedsGentle Leader Head Collar, Size: Small, Color: Royal BlueThe Gentle Leader, however, was the choice for short-nosed breeds. The Halti suffered when a shorter-snouted dog pawed at the noseband to remove it. The Gentle Leader's design cinched the dog's mouth closed with a locking mechanism, allowing it to be used snugly on short-nosed breeds. For standard-shaped noses, the cinching could be kept more loose to allow for more comfort. It did not have the side straps like the Halti, so it could ride up into the dog's eyes. The noseband was narrow and not padded (unless you shell out extra $ for the premium version not found in stores), so it bit into the dog's skin at the top of the nose. However, it came in multiple colors which helped it look less like a muzzle.GENTLE LEADER PROS: color choices, cinches tight for short-nose breeds, safety buckle connects to collarGENTLE LEADER CONS: uncomfortable narrow non-padded noseband (note: premium GL has nose padding, but still narrow), can ride up into eyesPetmate 3/4-Inch by 16-24-Inch Medium AKC Padded Dog Halter, BrownNew to the game was the Petmate AKC-branded headcollar. This came in many colors and was pre-fitted with a fleece padded noseband. The noseband color is always brown, and there are additional options for colors of the straps. This headcollar looked the least like a muzzle. However, the locking mechanism was not sturdy and would often slide, allowing dogs (even long-nosed breeds) to paw the noseband off their face. It also did not come with a safety strap to connect the headcollar to a dog's normal buckle collar (though one could be homemade very easily). It also buckles underneath the neck, rather than on the side of the face.PETMATE AKC PROS: color choices, fleece padded nosebandPETMATE AKC CONS: loose & slide-able lock, no safety strap to connect to collarNow, onto the Holt. The Holt is identical to the Halti except for two key features: a ""camlock"" and a foam-padded noseband. The camlock is a very tight locking mechanism that does NOT budge when the dog paws at the noseband. It is a great tool to keep the headcollar ON your dog. For short-nosed breeds, the camlock can be set tight and will stay in place. It has the same great features of the halti to prevent the noseband from riding up into the eyes, and the safety strap to connect the headcollar to a buckle collar. In addition, the noseband is padded with black foam material, not fleece, and is extremely soft and comfortable. It is sewn on the underside of the headcollar, and does not interrupt the color (can not be seen while the dog is wearing the headcollar). The Holt comes in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and blue.HOLT PROS: extremely comfortable, foam padded noseband, noseband doesn't ride up into eyes, camlock keeps noseband in place even with short-nosed breeds, multiple colorsHOLT CONS: ???If you are considering a headcollar to train your dog, I highly recommend the Holt for all breeds. It is a worthy successor to the Halti and addresses the cons of that headcollar.Please note that I have included customer photos showing the Halti and the Holt side-by-side in the ""customer photo"" section here:Coastal Holt Dog Walking Collar, Blue, Size 0"

117231,0,"I bought this because when I moved into my new apartment in Austin Tx. I noticed that I had some how picked up some travelers. The fleas were in my carpet, not sure if they came from moving in the furniture or if they were here before I got here. Either way, my fiancee was bringing our cat a few weeks later and we didn't want the cat to get bit like I had. I purchased the Frontline spray hoping that it would kill off the fleas, however, when i got the spray, I used it over the entirety of the carpet. Rubbed it into the carpet, and let it sit overnight. The product says that it should kill the fleas nearly immediately, however I still noticed fleas that night. I sprayed again the following 2 days, still noticed fleas. I purchased a new vacuums and this seemed to be the only thing that got rid of them. I don't know if it was a combination of vacuuming and the spray, but the spray didn't seem to do much on its own. It also stinks and claims to be poisonous, so i think in the future i will be only using it if it becomes a major problem again. I have heard from others that the product seems to be diluted from what it was in the past."
169484,0,"Based on the raving reviews, I thought i'd give this toy a try. I'll start by saying that my cat seems to be choosier than most, & very particular about what she engages/interacts with. The banana is soooo cute, sewn well, and filled w/organic cat nip. The cat nip (maybe because it's organic, I don't know) sent my cat into a sneezing frenzy & was extremely strong smelling. I laughed just watching her sneeze so much while trying to play with it. After batting it around & rubbing her face/body on it for about 5 minutes, she was done...pretty much for good. She LOVES the Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Cat Toy, however, and never tires of playing with it. Overall, I guess it depends on the cat. Some seem to love it , others don't. Mine didn't."
190523,1,"This is a great orthopedic dog bed! It is 7"" thick, when many other ""orthopedic"" dog beds are 1 1/2""! The cover on top is fleece, but the entire cover is not heavy duty. I would buy it again...best I found, and can always replace the cover. (its washable) Easy for my stiff old puppy to get on cause it squishes enough to let them get on, but stays thick enough to comfort old bones."
136980,2,"I have several sporns for other dogs -- and even the one with the front net for THIS dog. But this 'small' regular sporn has a collar FAR too small for my pug and it's useless for her. I will simply donate it to a shelter (the shipping would be almost more than the cost of the halter). But I'm getting a bit cranky about things that are not fully described. These descriptions need MEASUREMENTS. Like the collar is X-inches long! In this case &#34;weight&#34; does not help -- the collar is far far too small to go around her neck and there is almost no leeway to adjust it at all.I love the sporn concept, and I hate to leave a crummy review -- but even the picture is misleading -- on a standard poodle the width of the collar would be appropriate. But on a small dog it's the SAME 1.25&#34; wide collar as is used on the large and extra large so it's way too wide on her neck as well as too short -- I shouldn't have believed the picture!!!"

167140,0,The title says it all. The water tank leaked all over my floor. I made sure to press the plug in as firmly as possible. The water tank wasn't even 100% full. The food one...works? Not sure how a company could screw up a dry food dispenser.
83667,0,"I've only used this one a handful of times and it's already falling apart (I've had it several months, but don't like it). The joint where the two handles are joined together are becoming loose and wobbly.This item would be great if you only need to scoop up 1 poo at a time. I have 2 dogs and they poop like crazy. Even though I clean up daily, I have to scoop up about 6 piles of poop a day, and double if I skip a day. It is impossible to just pick up more than 1 pile with this product because the poop will fall out if you go to pick up another pile because they bottoms are at a steep angle. So I have to carry around a baggie and empty it each and every scoop and it can get messy that way. It's so much easier to get a pooper scooper that can lay flat, so I can pick it all up quickly and dump it out at once."
215124,0,My miniature schnauzer loves tennis balls. He tears the felt right off them. This toy is made just like a tennis ball. He tore the felt off in a matter of minutes. He still likes the toy and the squeaker remains intact so far. Should be a long-lasting KONG toy.
15638,2,"My dog has loud bark, but it didnt work well. I even tried on myself but it didnt work. I believe 1 of 10 times it worked.I was so stressful with this collar. I bought it because I saw a lot of good reviews on amazon. If you want to buy this, you should concern your choice."
147605,0,"This stuff is OK. On the plus side, it lasts forever outside because the birds only eat it when they have no other options. But they like my homemade suet cakes way better. You put the homemade out there with the store-bought and it's no contest - they flock to the homemade but leave the store-bought for when they're really desperate. So, I guess I'll use it up, but not sure if I'll ever reorder - unless I get sick of making the homemade stuff."
39690,0,"I purchased this litter pan in August ... it is now December 2010. The concept works well ... roll the pan onto it's top and all the waste is filtered and deposited into the tray then when you roll it back to it's upright position the clean litter is redistributed into the litter pan. The problem I encountered was when I took the top off to scoop small pieces of waste and add more litter. When I put the lid back on and pushed the clips that hold the top onto the bottom, one of the clips broke-third time unlucky. My husband has placed a clamp in the area where the clip broke so that when the litter pan is rolled onto it's top the litter stays in the litter pan. I do not recommend this litter pan. I'll be replacing it in the next couple of weeks for something more sturdy."
38636,1,"I have owned this litter box for 5 months now. I found it online when I was deciding whether I really wanted a cat again. The last one was very destructive and since the dog doesn't shed did I want the hair in my house again let alone the litter box smell. I am very anal about stuff like that. When I found it online, I also notice Petco carries it so I went there instead of ordering it online so I could see it in person. My goal was something my 10 year old could help with and not be lazy about since she was the one begging for this cute little kitten. I didn't need another responsibility. I was skeptical but bought it anyway. As others have said there are no instruction but looked easy enough. We brought it home, put it together, added the litter and waited for our dear little kitty to go to the bathroom. The opening is a little high for a kitten, we had to make a step for her. Once he did his business, we rolled and it worked like a charm. Of course, my daughter wanted a turn at that point. We love this litter box. The only thing I have found is it could be a little bigger. My cat is only about 10lbs but long. I noticed he pees on the sides sometimes. Yes you still have to maybe run the scooper on the bottom to loosen the clumps and then roll the box and it all comes out. Sometimes I think this could be related to the type of litter we use. I haven't tried another brand yet (Tidy Cat for multiple cats). There is still a smell if you don't clean it regularly. We also use an orange scented powder that you mix in with the litter we found at Walmart that helps with the smell. And yes your cat will still get litter outside the litter box. It comes off on their feet when they jump out. The box is perfect for how easy it is to clean and the time it takes. I have not had one problem with it. My daughter cleans it nightly. I change or add litter once a week, because like I said earlier I am anal about that and once a month I wipe it down with clorox wipes. The kitty loves to help and use it of course as soon as we're done to show his apprectiation!!!!! I would buy another in a heartbeat!!!!!"
63437,0,"To be accurate you need to be sure that all the air bubbles are off the swing arm. I've been unable to find a good way to do that, so have not been able to get repeatable measurements. A lot of bubbles makes the arm go to the max end of scale. That's OK, you can see the nubmer is bad right off. The trouble comes with just a few tiny air bubbles -- they give you a reasonable reading, but not an accurate one.I'll probably replace with a floating glass hydrometer."
142536,1,"I have had a Litter Maid for about 7 years with my 2 big cats. I have a Himalayian and a Main Coon. I have not scopped litter in 7 years, its great. Don't have to worry about it, I do have a few minor issues with it though and thats why I took a star away.1. the plastic receptacle is way too small if you have 2 cats (I modified it)2. the litter gets stuck in the rake sometimes (I use very good litter)3. I am on my third one, the motor started to get weak on the first and the little eye went on the second. BUT I love it so much I bought a third! The motor getting weak is understandable.Other than that this is a great invention! The problems are so minor that I am on my third one. The $89 is WELL WORTH the saved time and no scooping!I strongly recommend this product!"
102164,1,These are good poop bags. No struggle to tear them off cleanly or open quickly when needed. Good product for a fair price.

117122,1,"My rats love this cage topper!! My female tends to chew everything, yet she has not chewed the plastic ramps or shelves and she loves the house. We had to add a different water bottle that hangs from the side because the one included was too low to the ground. But my rats love to look through the hole in the roof of the house where the water bottle is supposed to go. Since my rats won't run on a wheel, they were getting fat. The ramps provide good exercise. I would recommend this to rodent owners, except those who keep mice. The bar spacing is too wide for mice, and maybe even for dwarf hamsters.Cleaning is as easy as spraying it off in the sink with a hose, or putting it in the dishwasher (but don't dry it in the dishwasher!).Fantastic Product! A+++!!!"

Nice, long fabric with long sturdy, plastic wand lets you play from your chair! Toss in kitty's direction, wrap around a paw, tail or kitty face, it's all good & safe!! I have 3 cats: 1 short leg chubby kitty in need of exercise; a royal ""diva"" who resists almost all toys except this one; & the ""runt of the litter"" adventurer who wants to play all day! Can't go wrong with this!"
32563,0,"Four of my seven cats are faucet drinkers, so the pet fountains have been a godsend. All of my cats love drinking from them.I purchased the Drinkwell Platinum in 2009 and it is still going strong...not a single problem with that one. It is relatively easy to clean (all versions have their hard to clean spots). The Platinum's pump is virtually silent (unless the water level is too low) with the only sound being the flowing water. VERY pleased with that model.I gave my sister the 360 fountain in July, 2010 and in May 2011 I purchased 2 Originals, keeping one for a second location in my house and giving the other to my Mom. They have not had any problems with their fountains and all of their cats love drinking from them as well.I have to say I do not like the Original fountain at all. I placed it in the hall outside of my bedroom and the motor was so loud I often unplugged it in order to get to sleep. My guess is that the Original is noisy because the pump is located outside, where as the Platinum's pump is submerged in the basin.The design of the Original just seems odd, as there are tubes that don't do anything, as if they might have had a function in a previous version but were simply closed off in the redesign instead of being removed.Cleaning it is much the same as the Platinum; both have annoying hard-to-access bits. Without the additional reservoir, I had to add water to the Original every day. The reservoir keeps it full for 2-3 days and while it is not overly difficult to use, I don't care for the design. While the reservoir is much easier to fill, as it has a flat top so it sits level, like a cup when filling it, I find the reservoir for the Platinum much easier to ""install"" on the fountain.I thoroughly hand-wash both fountains every two weeks, a dishwasher clean once a month and a quick wipe/rinse every week in between cleanings. Two days after the last rinse/wipe cleaning of the Original, I unplugged it for the night and when I plugged it back in the next morning, it would not work. I did a thorough hand-wash, including using the brush that gets in the pump, but it remains dead.So my bottom line is:Original = poor design, VERY loud pump and mine only lasted one year.Platinum = Better (but still somewhat annoying) design, virtually silent pump, larger capacity, and still running smoothly after 3 years.I also like the design of the Platinum's cord. It has a little thing on the cord, not far from the fountain, that allows the unit to be unplugged without having to unplug it from the outlet...which is nice, since I have it plugged in behind a cabinet.My advice would be to skip the Original and go for the Platinum for the best overall performance and satisfaction for you and your cats. ;)"

141148,1,"this is my cats favorite toy! it sounds just like a bird flying by him, and he loves it! thanks!"
128041,0,"I begrudgingly give this toy a 3 star rating. I was so excited when this arrived and I just knew it would keep my dog (a shih tzu) entertained for hours on end. Such was not the case. She figured out real fast how to get the squirrels out of the tree trunk. However, she then proceeded to chew and tear open the stuffed squirrels. I highly recommend this if your dog is not a chewer that destroys all of their toys. The tree trunk part is still intact so I put her other toys in it to let her dig out. I know that they sell replacement squirrels but I see no need to do that since she'll have them torn up within a matter of minutes. Otherwise, I'd rate this toy a 5 star rating."

11727,0,"I purchased this product just two weeks ago and does what it says. At first my cat was scared of the really loud noise that it makes when it is opening but now she is used to it. My only suggestions for this item is that it would be helpful for the machine to have a display timer that tells you exactly when the 6 hours start. The only way I know when the machine will open is upon turning the on switch. Once the switch is on, the timer starts at exactly that time and will open in exactly 6 hours from when it was turned on. Unless I remember or write down what time I turned it on, I will not be sure when the machine will open and display the food. My second suggestion is to include extra ice packs, two or three because the ice packs take a few hours to freeze and then by the time the meal has opened the packs have melted and I have to re freeze and wait another few hours before I replace them and reload. Or if they can create a way that the food can stay cool within the unit, perhaps if it had a built in cooler rather than an ice pack, I think that would be more efficient. All and all, I have pleased with the product but I don't think I will recommend it to anyone since it is not that impressive in my opinion."
33698,0,"It's a nice looking jacket, and the reflective tape is great, but there are a couple of things wrong with it. Ironically I just bumped into a co-worker in the hallway who confirmed this behavior, so it's not just me. First, it tends to slowly but surely wind it's way to one side or another, so your dog ends up half-covered, and my dog doesn't like it when it gets too far wound to one side. Second, the velcro connectors don't work very well, particularly after a couple of months. They stick to the fleece liner and not to the opposing velcro strip, and in fact one of the strips is actually coming off. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it."

87701,0,"The sound of the water falling was too loud for me as I sleep in the same room it's in. After a year or so of use the cover of the pump broke a bit which slowed down the water flow, now I can have the water fall behind the landing if I want, I've found that having the water fall right to the front of the top of the landing is the quietest. So if you're bothered by the sound of the water falling find a way to slow down the flow, I'm sure there're multiple ways to do it without breaking anything."
81883,2,"I purchased this seat cover for my Audi a4. I figured this is a lot easier than taking a blanket in and out every time I want to bring my dog somewhere. Boy, was I wrong. This cover is extremely slippery on the underside, my dog slides all over the place and struggles to stay sitting up. Luckily my grandmother is a seamstress, So I've modified the cover so that it actually locks into my seat belt buckles. Now all I have to do is find a way to keep the bottom half secured. Overall the product gets a 3. I couldve designed a better cover in my sleep. Obviously the person who designed this cover did not have pets."
212247,2,"I do not recommend this product for chinchillas. The main reason being is that within the ball, the temperature and humidity rise very quickly, causing deadly conditions for your chinchilla. Chinchillas also tend to urinate while inside the ball, which increases the humidity even more. The chinchilla can easily have a heat stroke and die within minutes of playing in this ball. If anyone were to use this toy for their chinchilla, I hope that playtime would be monitored and limited to a VERY short time, especially if weather conditions are already hot and/or humid. For the sake of your pet chinchilla, USE WITH CAUTION."
126595,1,Excellent overall appearance and quality of workmanship on this dog collar. The dark green color is especially attractive on our fawn Mastiff puppy; the hardware and stitching are substantial; the collar is sturdy and fits our pup comfortably with room to grow. We are very happy with this product.
73235,2,"Do not buy this cage! It is a piece of garbage. Upon assembly, the entire top cracked. Every time I clean it, a new piece breaks. The wheel is impossible to clean, as it does not come apart so waste collects and you will spend a great deal of time swirling water through it trying to get it clean to no avail. The sky tower does not fasten properly and your hamster will escape. Petco and all other sellers should be embarrassed to actually be taking money for such a piece of junk! Shame on all of them for continuing to sell such a poor quality product."
99443,0,"I noticed when I received the 5-meal feeder that a couple of edges on the instructions label (large label that takes up most of the underside of the lid) were peeling up. I pushed the edges back down, set up the timer, and it worked like a charm ... at first. After a couple of feedings, I came in and saw that the hopper had only partially turned, but enough to give my dog access to the food. I happened to be home during the next feeding time, and went to take a look as it turned. It only made it about halfway, then got stuck and made a cranking noise as it kept attempting to turn. I opened the lid and saw that the label had come unpeeled and curled, sticking to the hopper as it tried to run. I just peeled off the entire label and taped it inside the cabinet door for next time I need it. I'm not sure if they're using a defective glue or if the summer heat during shipping was just too much for it. It's working fine now, but I would have been EXTREMELY upset if this happened during the overnight trip we bought the feeder for."
212446,0,"I was expecting powder-coated steel top and bottom per the ad on Amazon, but got plastic. Not really flimsy plastic, but I'd have preferred metal. The nylon(?) mesh cylinder isn't rigid as I'd thought it would be, but was OK once I straightened it out from being squished in shipping.And also, this thing is MESSY to fill -- seeds fly everywhere through the mesh as seed is poured in. Once filled, things stay put, but better to fill this over or even in your seed bucket. I doubt that it would be durable enough to live through many winters in a cold climate, but should be OK here in TX. It probably will be vulnerable to squirrels, who can chew right through the mesh. So far my birds aren't really getting the ""hang on and eat"" style of this feeder, but when they are hungrier they probably will. The cardinals are especially confused by no perches except the seed tray.So I think it's a decent value for the money and the feeder's size, but a lot of corners were cut here. It's no top of the line $100+ Duncraft, that's for sure."
216447,0,"It is a good toy for dogs & it keeps them occupied for a long time. But be aware that it gets trapped under couches if they push it there and your getting it out all the time. And if you have hardwood floors like I do, it makes a lot of noise, because the ball is hard. I rated the toy based on how much my dog plays with it and likes it and you only get 1 ball, I thought you got all 3."
25893,0,"My outdoor cat is in love with this heated disk and I heat it for him all winter and would never dream of not using it...but if you do not get to it to re-heat it with in 10 hours or so it is cold as an ice brick and I often find my poor cat curled up on it trying to keep warm when it is probably making him colder than if he just had his blankets! So if you cant easily get to it in a winter snow storm like I can (our cat lives in a dog house on our deck so I can reach the heat pad from the slider door of my house) then dont buy this product! Your poor animal will be freezing to death on a hard frozen disk if you dont go re-heat it! Also, when I ordered it a couple months ago I thought it was gonna be sorta soft but it is not rubbery or flexible, it is hard as a rock even when hot...this is not a deal breaker for my cat, he loves the warmth. I still give it 3 stars because my cat loves it and I find it easy to use, I just wanted the downsides brought up. I probably should have bought one that plugs in!"
11652,0,"Wish the timer was a little more universal. Sometimes the 6 and 12hour doesn't fit ,my needs. Plus once I fill and set it I only have those choices.

It simply was not intriguing to her. We have recently switched to simple, standard bells which she loves to nose and play with, and consequently has made potty training much easier."

152495,0,"Our in ground system lasted only 3 months due to a bad lightning storm. I fully expected to have to purchase a new one but when I called, the company replaced our system but highly recommended the lightning protection kit. Until the lightning, it worked well. We did not do a good job in training our dogs and due to our errors, they basically trained themselves. They are big puppies (85 and 105 lbs) and they stayed in the confined area 99% of the time and we had it set to the lowest setting. It was relatively easy to set up but not if digging the trench by hand. Rent a trench digging machine - it saves so much time.

103810,1,"Before I bought this car seat for my chihuahua, it was difficult taking her in the car with me, unless I had someone in the passenger seat willing to hold on to her. Even then - she was constantly wanting to move from the passenger side to my lap. She couldn't see out the windows & wasn't stable as I braked or turned. But now, I slip her harness on her & attach it to the strap that comes with this seat & she's in doggy heaven. Quiet as she can be. Just stares out the window & watches the world go by. I feel so much more comfortable knowing she's safely secured to the seat belt in the event I need to stop quickly or turn. Also, the liner comes out & is machine washable, haven't had to do that yet, but s nice feature nonetheless. Well worth the money. Works just as we'll in the backseat as the front. A harness is a must with this seat, but that's true with any dog car seat."

121868,0,"Whatever taste or scent this might have, my dog didn't seem to notice (or at least not mind). She took to it right away since she LOVES rope toys. We played tug for a little bit but all she really ended up wanting to do was run away with it to destroy in the corner.I got this in large but really, it's not that big. I was hoping it would be the size of her old tug toy which was much bigger than this. I have a doberman and while she's not a huge dog, she's not small. When she grabs a toy to play tug she'll try to move up the toy a little bit to get a better grip. This toy makes the distance between that and my hand uncomfortably close. So really even for just a medium sized dog, this one is too small.I'd recommend to look for a bigger one. She loved destroying it though but it wasn't much use for tug."
65760,2,"I wanted to love this brush - I have an old Four Paws brush that ""somehow"" ended up with the handle chewed off. the old brush was my favorite for my tender skinned aussie - and I had it for about 8 years.this new brush is plastic handled instead of wood - which is evident from the picture.The big problem with the new style is the little black safety ends are breaking off the pins after about 2 days of use. this leaves little sharp pins - making my pups & me unhappy."

25833,1,"I have an 8 lb chihuahua who is cold most of the time. When it's especially cold out, I throw the snugglesafe in the microwave and it gets pretty warm. He snuggles up to keep his paws more. He hasn't tried to chew it or destroy it, so it has passed that test so far. After 8 hours you can still feel some warmth, but obviously it doesn't hold the temperature as high as an electric heater. I like this because I know my dog won't electrocute himself and he is still warm. I think I may buy one for my cat."

22450,1,"I just wanted to say that this product was well worth the money! As soon as I recieved it, I tried it on one of my cats (BoBo), and it was so incredible how much hair was coming off of him. He really seemed to enjoy the brushing too! Then I tried it on my other two cats and I swear I could have built a new cat with all the hair that was being shaved off there coats. I definately give this product 5 stars because it's done what it said it would do. You won't be sorry buying this product."

79888,0,"I bought the largest model (Model 620) of this cage to house two guinea pigs in the plastic pan by removing the grill floor.The cage is well-built and easy to assemble. However, it was poorly packaged and slightly damaged during shipping. The mesh roof was bent and scuffed and some of the blue paint was scuffed.(Other reviews have said that this cage does not work well with rabbits because they can urinate down the legs of the cage.)With the grill floor removed, I'm not very confident in the security of the plastic pan with the weight of animals, food bowls, etc. The two end clips, designed to stabilize and secure the plastic pan, do not work at all. They do not clip onto the pan as intended.Therefore, the pan easily slides out of the cage. Once the pan is out a couple of inches, it is free to flex and fall to the floor.Although not recommended by the manufacturer, my solution was to cut the lip off both ends of the plastic pan, remove the top of the cage and slide the pan in so that it rests on the grill floor. The pan fits perfectly this way and is more secure.Furthermore, if the grill floor is relocated to the slots intended for the pan, the two end clips actually work and help secure and stabilize the grill floor.Such a large cage on wheels is a great idea, but I think the design needs some work.I communicated these concerns to the manufacturer, thinking the feedback may be appreciated. The response was mainly confusion (intentional?) of the shipping damage with the modifications I had to make, and denial of any problems with the design."

My dog's very first interaction with this (So Call) well built toy, was disappointing for me. Also I felt ""TRICKED AGAIN"" ripped off. The house where the squirrels are put in, ripped when my dog put his stount in to get the squirrels out. Because my dog appears to really like this toy, I sewed the material back together. This is very disturbing. The TOYS are made for pets.

43605,0,"I changed from a clay litter because of the amount of dust to the Swheat Scoop. The SS has less dust than clay and it can be flushed down the toilet, however there are some drawbacks. I use the Omega Paw litter box with 3 inches of litter. It does stick to the bottom with even 3 inches of litter, but with this type of box, I can bang the outside of box when it is upside down to free the bottom clumps. A good litter mat reduces the tracking outside the box.I feed my cats EVO and Wellness cat food but one cat has really stinky poo that overpowers the SS litter, so the odor control is average. I learned to never feed Fish cat food to a Siamese cat, the odor is seriously bad. The extra strength Ever Clean worked better for poo odors, but it's very dusty and not flushable. So far, I've have not noticed any bugs or mice getting into the litter box but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened due to the wheat.Plan to try the Feline Pine for a month with the Omega Paw box and see which one works better for minimizing fecal odors. Since the litter box is near our bathroom, I would rather have a flushable, clumping litter. I will use Arm and Hammer to control the odor and find ways to work around the stickiness and pest problems."
162229,1,I have two dogs - a one year old WestiePoo and a 12 year old Bichon - they fight over this toy. It is very sturdy and they love the fact that there is rawhide to eat also.It definately keeps them busy and occupied.

58133,0,"Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!My dislikes for the TAJ are:*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble."

25829,0,"Product seems to need to be heated 2 or more minutes longer than guidelines suggest. I am heating for almost 8 minutes but based on my microwave watts, I should only be heating up to 5 minutes. That just didn't get the object hot and it did not hold heat at 5 minutes. I could touch it with my bare hands and not need to have a cover on it to touch it.I increased the heating time by 30 seconds on a daily basis until I reached 8 minutes. Now it seems to get hot and stay hot but still not near the 10 hours I was expecting it to hold the heat. Am I doing something wrong? Do a significant number of people have to heat the object longer than the directions suggest?I want to make this product work as my dog is quite cold during the day. I appreciate any positive input anyone can offer. Thanks."
31407,0,didn't notice any change in my cat's behavior. Maybe he didn't need comfort. Could be he is just neurotic. So
1233,0,Seems like this company/brand is falling apart. They used to be great but they're just okay now. These used to be thin long strips that actually looked like achilles tendons (two points of insertion at 1 end and one point of attachment on the other end) as pictured. The new one is just a giant slab thats 2-3 inches wide and doesn't interest my dog at all.
40035,2,"My girlfriend convinced me that I needed to get more up to date with my kitty litter box...and that I should no longer be using shovels to clean out the litter. I thought that sounded great! So I ordered this product in the largest size, because I have 2 large male cats. At first I liked the product, this was like the first few times I used it. Of course the product was new, so I was out there cleaning it several times to see how it worked and what was going on. Well, the grate that separates the litter from the waste gets blocked up from the urine creating a cement in contact with the litter. So I changed litters...noticed a LITTLE change. Still had same problems. I found that it worked okay if I cleaned it 3 times a day (a little excessive for something that was supposed to be easier). But, even doing it more often did not eliminate the issues of the grate coming undone as you roll it (sometimes), then requiring you to open up the whole unit, pull out the waste drawer that was now full of perfectly good litter, try to get it all sorted out the way it was supposed to be without making more of a mess. I finally got so tired of having to open this thing up to clean up the messes, that I have now taken it all apart and am using it as a normal litter box. I HATE this product. I assume it works well with smaller cats or single cats. But this box has created undue stress for me. I recently ordered the litter robot...yes very expensive (but with money back guarantee and extended warranty), but at this point I'd spend $1000 so I don't need to think about this Omega product any longer (yes I exaggerate)."
37938,0,"I clean the box every day, but unfortunately, the box itself does nothing to trap the odor. It's a great idea and would probably work for one cat but certainly not two. I still have to scrape the bottom of the box to get all the wet out. I feel that a regular box did more for the odor and will probably go back to a standard litter box."
130,0,"Service from seller was excellent. Halti sizing, however, was not. I went by my dog's weight (65 lbs) and purchased a size 3.

Very disappointed since I cannot use this product and return postage plus replacement postage would be about the price of a new one."

113399,0,"Fits cage nicely and the rim around the edges is the same height as the lower lip of the cage. We have used it for a month now for our 50 lbs Pit--mix for night sleeping only. The only complaint is that the fleece is coming out in small patches when she gets out in the morning. Its almost as like the fleece is rolling into balls and separating as she moves about. Maybe a washing will help remove the excess. Not much padding on the bottom, which would help with insulation. All in all, its fine."
82659,0,"Very happy with the cage aspect of this item, however, I searched and searched to make sure I purchased one that was all metal.

Still works well and happy with purchase, just no pull out tray for easy clean up anymore."

117802,0,"So I received the filters in a three pack, I purchased these because it was recommended from the tank kit I recently purchased. Everything seems to be okay, except for one thing. The filters seem to leak the material inside the filters. I didn't think it was a big deal at first until I saw that there is six chambers filled with this black rock like material, only four of the chambers are filled. The two chambers that are not filled are on both ends of the filter. My problem with that is, those ends are were the water first makes contact with the filter as well as when it leaves the filter. So the water is not getting filtered as much as it should be. When it comes to taking care of your animals its important that cleaning is done the right way. I will use these up and look for another brand that will fit my tank. Or purchase them locally so I can inspect them before I buy them."

He seems to want to play with it and get the treats out, however, the hard plastic seems to be throwing him off a bit. He tends to like softer toys, but destroys them fairly quickly. The Buster Cube is so durable, I don't think he will be able to destroy it no matter what he does. I would recommend this toy to others, just be aware that your dog may take a while to really warm up to it."

He loves him so much that I am having to find the toy again online because its been ""loved"" so much. One thing I love about him though is that although the tail and ears have been ripped off, the body is still intact no matter what he does. Very soft and extra squeaky....great toy!"
77280,2,"I already had a shorter plastic exercise pen for my dog (different manufacterer) - I wanted a second one for use outside. This pen is taller than my other plastic pen; however, it is so flimsy that my small dog could push it over (or perhaps even high wind). Plus the door rattles constantly (annoying) and because the plastic is so thin I felt that my dog would chew it apart... so I returned the pen.So not all plastic exercise pens are created equal! Either get a sturdier plastic pen or go for a metal one."

However, this monkey stood up to his razor sharp teeth, and unrelenting drive to eviscerate for several months. Most toys, even the seemingly durable Kong squeek toy, last just a day or two. I would highly recommend, as this is a quality product overall and is a great size for a medium-sized dog. Taking one star away just because he was eventually able to rip the monkey's face off:)"

Unfortunately, I bought this to replace a friend's which I had borrowed and damaged. I can't give them a smaller, lesser product than what I had originally borrowed, so I'll have to order a larger one. The lid of this also seems more brittle than my original, so I think my next purchase will be from a different maker."
88232,0,Cat loves it. Cleaned as directed and had to replace the pump in less than a year. Could try to jump through the hoops to get it replaced under warranty but poor kitty is staring at the empty fountain with a longing glance so it's easier to just cough up the $20+ to replace it now. Maybe the next one will keep working longer... Replacing pump is still better than buying another whole unit that may do the same thing.
142315,0,"I bought this crate pad because of the good reviews it received. Now it has arrived and it does seem like a nice cushion for the price. However, It is made in China. I want to buy American as much as possible, so I'm sending it back."
56919,0,I have 2 kittens and 1 cat. I used this product on all of them and to my surprise it didn't work that well. It seemed to work the best on my long-haired girl kitten because she stopped scratching for a few days but now has started back. It seemed to reduce the population of the fleas but it didn't eliminate them. And I notice that all of them are scratching their ears now. Maybe they ran in there?I would say this product will probably work better if you treat your entire house and the pets at the same time. I will try this product again because it did work better than the products I bought from the store.
107127,1,"Very easy to set up and clean. The kit contains everything you need to get started and then some. We especially like the fact that the hamster cannot catch his feet or little stubby tail in the wire mesh or in the spokes of the wheel. The only problem we had is that there is not a lot of room for toys, but that is solved by rotating toys frequently in and out of the cage which is more fun for the pet anyway. Highly recommended."
152059,0,"It's basically a vinyl cover with plastic rods to support it. The littermaid just fits inside. Kinda nice that it fits inside it, because my cat likes to kick the litter around, and at least this contains it rather than before having little bits of litter spraying all over the place.My cat loves it, and it's keeps his litter area clean too.Only thing, i wish the little ramp to the litterbox was longer and easier to clean. What I end up doing is placing an even larger mat underneath it to collect excess litter that my cat kicks out."
143345,2,"Got this cage yesterday, was fairly easy to put together. Our hamster escaped from it the first night he was in it. Not sure why they don't put a lock latch on the top part of the enclosure. Lock seems sturdy on door of main cage. Apparently he pushed the top door open. Would have been nice if the top latch was more secure. Hope we find him. My daughter will be heartbroken."
127962,2,"We have a 1.12 pound puppy (pomeranian puppy), and she recently started hacking, like she was trying to clear her throat. We couldn't figure out the source for this, until we found that the stitching on the INSIDE of this toy (the log, where the squirrels go) was not properly sewn, and there was exposed stuffing along the inside of this log/toy. She had been eating the stuffing! Lo and behold, when we took this toy away the hacking has almost completely gone away. She is ITTY BITTY and not an aggressive chewer, but with any puppy, if they can eat the stuffing and it's exposed they will do it. For the price, I am extremely disappointed! I thought this would be a high quality toy, and found out the hard way that it is not. BE CAREFUL PURCHASING THIS TOY."
64539,0,"I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product."
207233,0,"To me, the color and quality seems to be no worse than the other rainbow colored ferret/rat products (tunnels, cubes, etc.) out there. It's hard to rate its durability since my rats were disinterested in it enough that they didn't even try to chew its walls the way they do with the nests they love. In fact, compared to other areas of their cage, they weren't very interested in hanging out in it at all. But my biggest complaint is the zippers. They unzip way too easily. Every time a rat climbs up and over the top, they unzip. And this is from petite females who aren't even at their full adult weight yet! After only a few days, the unzipping issue made me deem the tent shape unsafe for my one rat who has head-tilt and I then tried stringing it up as a flat hammock instead for a few more days, but its odd shape when flat made an awkward hammock that they didn't like either, and I haven't put it back in their cage since.Dimensions note: Since its fabric floor is not stiff, the weight of just one 195g rat was enough to make it sag down to a total height of 18"" when occupied.It's not a terrible product, but since there are so many better sleepers out there that won't unzip and won't take up as much vertical space, I wouldn't recommend it."
75454,0,"I was so disappointed to receive a plain, flat wood style of the Black Pine Majesty Stand. I expected to receive the raised board design as pictured. I agree with Hardy85 whose review stated the same complaint and figured it to be a more recent version. I suggest you contact the seller before you make your purchase and ask about the product. The stand was packed well, however, the door hinges were loose and the floor base is uneven which causes it to wobble. Overall structure is workable (I can fix the problems), but the bottom line is always BUYER BEWARE."
202124,1,Great Product. Must be careful not to use too much pressure or you will hurt your dog. Needs to be done outside where the fur can fly. Would buy again.
44451,1,"I bought this item to replace our existing Drinkwell fountain. We have had two of the Drinkwells and each seemed to work well for a year or so and then the pumps gradually became louder until neither we nor our cat could stand it. So far this item seems to work well, it is definitely quieter than the Drinkwells. After the first 24 hours it started making a buzzing noise, but after I unplugged it for about 12 hours and then plugged it in again the noise was gone - I think maybe there were air bubbles in the pump? We have been using it for about a month now and it is still running quiet, I hope it stays that way longer than the Drinkwells did.Note, unlike the Drinkwells the power cable for this unit has a small transformer block at the plug. Not sure if that would matter to some people or not."
82057,0,"Perfect size for a medium sized cat. This is easily installed with a jig saw and works great without the door in. When it got cold we added the door as to avoid drafts from the basement... The cats did get used to it, but it pinches their tail unless they go through either really slow or really fast."
25848,1,"This is possibly the best thing I have ever bought for my cat. I put it under a couple baby blankets because it is a hard disc but it stays warm for at least 8 hours and while it's warm my cat wants no part of getting out of her bed. I'm so happy because before she would sit on the cable box, heat vents etc. and I was always worried she would get too hot so this is AWESOME!!!!!"
50033,2,Was very disappointed with this purchase. Received the cage very promptly however due to poor packaging the hamster wheel was broken.

82992,0,"I Crate Single Door - 22"" L x 13"" W x 16"" HFunctionally, this product works as advertised. Setup is a breeze and should have taken no longer than five minutes, at most. But to my surprise, when I took the cage out of the box and began to set it up, my hands found a number of metal burrs around the ends of the metal bars, many on the inside where the puppy could have been hurt. I was pricked on the finger by one of these myself.I spent the next half an hour with a file removing at least six burrs from the cage. It was disappointing to see such shoddy workmanship in what was otherwise a great product.Yes, I'm using it, but I wanted to submit this review in the hope that it would prepare others to have a file standing by in case their cage arrived without the normal quality control you would expect. I certainly would have rated this product 5-stars had it not been for this major oversight on the part of the manufacturer."
178453,0,"I thought this box would be great because of the ramp that is supposed to catch the litter as they walk out. Instead, the litter gets tracked all over the stairs and out of the box. Another appeal of the box was that the main litter area was away from the entrance and I thought my dog may not be able to reach the ""scooby snacks."" Wrong again...the dog can still reach in and eat the poop. Gross!So if you are thinking of buying this box for either of those reasons, keep searching."

Bottom line, after 1.5 days, this thing is amazing!Truly an attention grabber and it seems that is all she needs. She was either semi-deaf or had grown deaf to my voice. Doesn't matter anymore! I'm being very careful to use this as a training tool and to not spook or carelessly abuse the power of the shock. It is working great!Most importantly she is beginning to respect the wife and 10 year old boy. Instead of me yelling, and them yelling, we are now calmly controlling and/or redirecting.This is more of a testimony to the power and ease of use of the shock collar. Make sure you are a tempered person as you could easily damage a dog if used carelessly.As far as this particular unit? I know no different but it seems to have all the features that anyone would need. It is easy to use. Oh yeah, the transmitter did not work upon arrival. I contacted the company and spoke to a knowledgeable (lifetime free (I think)) tech support person that determined a new transmitter should be sent. I received the new transmitter and the unit works perfectly.I would highly recommend this unit and this company."

108811,2,"This training lead did not last a month. I use this for one of my dogs, in training to stay in the yard, and not chase critters. The lead was never left outdoors, and only used a couple times a day. It did get used in the rain, however. One day, I noticed that lead was divided in two..It had separated, and it seems the material just could not stand getting wet. I found this, and then attached the pieces together...However, two weeks later, the lead broke in another place...I tried to fix it, and it broke again. This was all while the dog was in the yard, being supervised. He did not chew it...It might have gotten tangled in a twig, but that is about all. I still have a another lead that I bought..Paid a bit more for it, and it is still intact after 6 months."
180760,0,I purchased several Peter's woven products and this is the only one that I'm a little disappointed in.The bunny pictured in the bed must be a mini because this is not nearly big enough for either of our bunnies to actually sit inside it like it shows in the picture.The grass mats are bigger and they had a lot of fun with the grass ball too.
129903,0,"The product is what it is and does what it does. I was looking for a cat toy like this for the 'right' price. I found something I liked here. My cat doesn't think much of it yet, she's slow to warm up to new things. (I also should have hung it a little lower and used the catnip that she prefers, but she should come around after she has a little while to sniff at it."
117260,1,"Wow. I was really surprised just how effective this unit was. Perfect for a low cost in unit tank for an office tank, or gift for like a nephew or something. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the air driven unit plus super easy to dose ozone w/ it. Very fine micro-bubbles and super dry bubbles. color me impressed. I'd buy another in a flash."

179004,2,"I bought this product to train my two 6 year old Tonkinese cats. I knew there was a possibility of failure, but I had no idea just how dramatic the failure would be. My cats have never had a single accident outside of their two litter boxes but resorted to relieving themselves in their beds after over 24 hours of refusing to get anywhere near the product that was carefully installed on two toilets. The toilets we chose were right next to where their litter boxes had been, and we had already been using a flushable wheat litter so there was no adjustment there. I believe that the extreme flimsiness of the product terrified them each time my husband or I placed them on the device (probably 20+ times in 24 hours). I would have never purchased this item if I had seen it in stores because the extreme flimsiness was far worse than I had imagined even after reading prior negative reviews. I feel very fortunate that both cats immediately went right back to using their litter boxes and would never recommend or even give away the two kits we purchased. Beware!!"
25508,0,"The strin is a little slippy, i had one before with a leather harness part that his legs went thru, this was a safer design. This one can choke him if he runs alot, but it does work to keep him around."
42871,2,"Kristin is right, it's sticky and it stays on the fur. Moreover, I followed the directions to a T . . . but when my cat shook her head, the product went into one of her eyes. It was clearly extremely painful for her. There is no caution anywhere on the label stating that this product is an eye irritant or worse. I bought this product to help my cat's ears, not hurt her eyes."
24680,2,"This looked like such a great idea, but the only thing that bubbled was the reservoir, and it filled the bowl all over the floor, no stopping it. One arm of the bubbler was broken. This could be a great product if it weren't plastic. Its a good concept, but the product is poorly made. I've returned this product, don't buy it."
152222,2,"For some reason, the finches we have at our house refuse to use this feeder -- even though they flocked to a cheap $5 tube feeder I had before this one! The other cheaper feeder had a flat tray on the bottom, which they seem to prefer over this design. I left it hanging out there for weeks and not one bird used it, so I finally gave up."
17200,2,"My dog only barks when he is in his crate. Used exactly as directed and startled him for the first 5 mins to where he didn't bark in his crate. After that he just kept on barking and whining and the collar would spray after every little sound he made, so it was empty in less then 2 mins. And at $10 a refill can, it can get very expensive when the can is gone in 2-3 days. We will probably have to go to a vibrating or sound collar, or a shock collar even though we don't believe they are humane. What to do?"
60493,1,"Earlier this year I bought a different brand. It seemed to work, but needed to be applied more like every three weeks than the directed 30 days. Fleas are terrible and getting resistant to this stuff. I don't want to give my Dogs Comfortis (I'm convinced it gave one of my dogs seizures) so this is the next best thing. Frontline seems to work as well, if not better than the other products of this type.came via prime in 2 days!"
16478,2,"Day 2 of having the barrier in place I caught my dog sniffing the transmitter. I know what you're thinking the ""sensor was not on or not properly put on the dog."" This is not true, I am a dog handler for the government, I assure you that everything was attached and activated properly. My personal dog was sniffing the transmitter it was beeping, but there was no change in the dogs behavior.There is no way that this product is going to HONESTLY prevent a dog from going into an area. It does work as a quiet alarm, but not as a static collar.I gave a 2 star review because as I mentioned it does work as a quiet beeping alarm."
75330,2,"When it was time to move our Shepherd up to a larger crate we thought this would be ideal, it was not the brand we had bought in the past however the size attracted us. Our dog is strong willed and his sole ambition in life is to get out of any crate you put him in, his last crate lasted him 18 months before he rendered it unusable. This crate lasted less than 2 hours the main concern is once he demolished the tray he then pulled apart the bottom bars breaking the welds he had pulled up one of the bars and it was sticking up around 9&#34; into the crate, fortunately he had not hurt himself on this, the next pet may not be so lucky. If you have a strong willed dog and value your pet stay away from this product. We have many pets and cages this is the first time we have purchased a Midwest product and will be the last there are many better brands of Chinese rubbish out there."

46484,0,"Overall this product was ok. I was disappointed in the condition of the product when it arrived. The wood side panels came chipped and the screw holes had 2 inch cracks along the side. It wasn't worth returning since it was so heavy, but I was able to conceal it by just turning the cracked panels toward the wall."

146376,2,"i bought these clippers at petsmart. i even bought extra andis ceramic blades. unfortunately these clippers work great for very fine hair, but are useless on thicker, wiry or curly coats. you can forget about shaving mats with these. i'm in the market for better clippers."
112496,1,"Our 11 year old female cat was having trouble walking as her hind legs were sliding out to the side and she was unable to walk on her tip toes as a healty cat is able to do.We had read reviews of this product and were skeptical because we had tried others with no results. After using this product for a short time, we noticed some improvement as she was walking a little straighter but still was not able to walk on her tip toes or go up and down the stairs without taking a really long time.After using Cosequin for a full 2 months, she is now not only able to walk on her tip toes but she runs up and down the stairs, jumps on the bed and runs and plays like she is half her age! She shows no signs of having had any problems walking and best of all she absolutely LOVES the taste of the product mixed in with her wet food!Cosequin is an Amazing product and I would highly recommend it for any pet that is having trouble like my baby girl was. She looks great and we couldn't be happier!!"
188942,1,"Our cat (medium sized long hair) felt right at home with the carrier, and I was pleased with the $25 savings over the chain pet store. We set it out for a week before travel, occassionaly placed some treats inside, and that is all Annie needed to feel comfortable.Lightweight yet sturdy. Easy to carry over your shoulder (versus a hard shell carrier). Fit perfectly under the seat of a Delta 757. Crown Room compatible!"
172028,0,"This product has the perfect price...and is nice looking for those who get into purple and black. I've tried to figure out if I'm missing something though, for it doesn't seem to extend. This is important because someone who is 6 foot tall, will have to scoop dog doo, bent over the entire time. I'm only 5'2"" and still have to bend some. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but I can't seem to find a place that might make the length of this greater. You will also need to adapt to using one hand to squeeze the product for it to pick up, after you get used to that, its not that bad of a deal, but it does take some getting used to. I liken it to using one of those hand excersie balls. It's strongest point is its ability to pick up poops easily, i have a ""trailer"" dog, who walks as she goes..aside from the bending, this scooper did a great job and was well worth the money."
43632,2,"Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever."
28598,0,Unfortunately its hard to estimate size with these toys but I went by a ladies comment on how her labs loved it. Thinking that labs made this toy last I thought my two pit mixes would do the same. It was half chewed in just a couple of days. Nylabone toys are great all around but if you have big chewers I would look for a jumbo size.
191306,0,Great product if you have multiple dogs. Making sure the filter is changed and unit cleaned is a must.Cleaning the unit thoroughly is difficult at best even with the purchase of the cleaning kit which in my opiion is pretty much a waste of money. The sharp edges and deep cavities make cleaning difficult as the corners of the inside of the unit collect dirt films which are hard to get to. They need to engineer the inside without the edges and use curved/rounded designs.Good luck!
80228,0,Been using this product with the seachem flourish for a few weeks now but don't really notice a big change in my plants. This product was poorly packaged and one of the bottle was leaking when I opened it. I sent pictures to amazon and they didnt do anything about so be aware of this when your buying.
120018,0,"This item is not so hot. Usually I try to give Amazon products a good review but I cannot with this one.What happens is this: you put the media in the filter tray and a week later it has shrunk to about 80% of the original size.How in the hell does it do that? ?So, a lot of water running through the Aqueon Sump (see my review of that) ends up not being filtered.I solved the problem by buying bulk filter media and cutting it over-sized by 3/4"". Plus, I lay in 3 at a time (on top of each other). Now, the hand-made media lasts months.My tank is now crystal clear."
109495,2,"I bought it so my cat would not pick under my bedroom door at 3 a.m. to tell me she's hungry and wants breakfast NOW. Instead of picking under my door, she picked around the mat, which was just as annoying. If I leave my bedroom door open a crack with the mat in front, she just jumps over it and into the room. I think two mats placed side by side across my doorway would work best, but for now I think I'll go back to piling blankets and pillows in front of the door so I don't hear her picking and scratching. I'm sure it will work fine for chairs and counters, but my cat doesn't have that problem. Oh well, live and learn."
174611,0,"Here's the deal with this product...I think it would work OK, but only under certain conditions. First, you have to have the time and patience to train your dog not to go near the boundary. Of course, if you can do that, you might not need this system at all. The second thing is, if you dog has a thick coat, this product may not work. Even after ordering the longer contacts specifically designed for long-haired dogs, it was still hit or miss. And...if your dog runs at the boundary, he or she can easily run right through the shock zone. No matter what the company says, the system simply cannot respond quick enough to beat a fast dog to the punch. Again, all of this could probably be eliminated if you have a very trainable breed. If you have a breed that is very independent minded, such as the dogs we have, I suggest putting up an old-fashioned fence...which I'll be doing this weekend."
61256,2,"This is my 5th LitterMaid box but first ""Elite"". The old style worked well. This one does not. The rake does not go low enough to get all the clumps, and there is too much space between the tines of the rake. If something sticks to the bottom, the rake will just take the top part off and leave a mess. The clumps stick to the rake instead of being dumped. The rake dumps about a cup of unused (clean) litter with each cycle, but no waste. I have tried more litter and less litter. No difference. I use ""Worlds Best Litter"". It does clump well and is not cheap. Does this manufacturer test these things with real cats????? My first and last Elite. Guess I need to buy one of the old styles while they are still available. Buyer beware."
70455,0,"Overall, a respectable product and perhaps the most durable one available. However, the quality of construction clearly was not in line with its high price tag. Also, the manufacturer put stickers in the bowls which left significant residue when removed, requiring us to wash/scrape them out before use."
17746,0,"I found the spray collar to be fairly effective at stopping my dog from barking, but it had its drawbacks. My dog quickly learned that he should not bark when the collar is on. However it had little effect on his barking when the collar was removed. Also, he got very sad whenever we put the collar on him. He would mope around for as long as it was on, and would slowly recover once we removed it. It was pretty pitiful.That being said, it did work as a deterent. All we had to do was show him the collar and he would calm down for a while (5-10 minutes). But for our dog it was not a very practical solution.A bigger problem was that the collar occasionally misfired. Once I was standing in my kitchen, the dog standing near me, and I heard the collar spray him. He had not made any noise of any kind. He winced and backed away, confused. Not good.Even worse, eventually the collar failed catastrophically. Last week the dog ran into the house with the collar continuously spraying him in the face. It was stuck in the ""spray"" mode. It emptied its entire load of citronella. We quickly removed the collar, which was now blowing mostly air and faint wisps of the spray, and it continued to try to spray as we held it. The dog was scared, confused, and stunk of citronella. Not good at all.I think this product has potential to be an effective training tool, but the risk of failure should make buyers think carefully about it."
165884,2,"I bought this size because I read some reviews about the handle being too small and thought it might be helfpul for my husband to have a larger handle. Unlike the cord leash, the belt leash has a strong continual pull on the dog. This was too much for my dog and I ended up needing to return it."
186066,1,"My 12 yr old shihtzu went thru a really bad skin problem. She's on a good diet, daily supplements, and medicine to help her fight the hair loss. We tried everything possible. But we were unable to recover the hair on her body. It never grew back until we used this shampoo.I read the review on [...] and decided to give it a try. We really had nothing to lose since her skin problem was really bad. Little did I know, this was the best purchase I made for her. The first time we used this shampoo on her, we noticed she was not as itchy after the bath. We continued to use this shampoo on her for couple months, her hair started to grow back. After few months, the hair was almost back. At the time, we took her for another check up and the vet prescribed a different medicine. After 1 month, her hair is all back. I would highly recommend this shampoo to any dogs with skin problem."
6875,1,"Have a half greyhound half German shep, huge nose :) fits great, light, and she doesn't mind. Used it because she was a rescue and did not know how she would react to my cat and dog park. She was nothing to worry about but still still great she doesn't mind it one bit. First minute she will claw at it, then after that nothing. Very happy!"
6924,1,I got these for my collie mix because she always puts her head out the window and I was concerned about her getting dust and debris in her eyes. They stay on great and she got used to them very quickly. I highly recommend them.
46776,1,I love this. When it arrived it was more than I expected. Definitely worth the price I paid. Shipped fairly quickly. I have a pretty large rabbit and he fits perfect with a lot of room to move around.
52034,0,"The net I received had a split in the pole where the net head attaches. So the net actually bobs up and down a little if I shake the pole, like it's going to fall apart. I may have to reinforce the pole end with duct tape or something. Otherwise, the net works ok for removing dead leaves and floating plants from my fish pond in preparing for the winter. I don't feel I can scoop up a full load of wet leaves because of its flimsy feel right now. I'm afraid of telescoping it because the net head feels like it will break off. So I do a little at a time."
115829,1,"I bought the large pet residence for my 4 month old already crate trained golden retriever. I am very pleased with it. It is a very attractive looking crate and sits right next to the bed as an over sized bedside table. The outer frame (so far) seems sturdy enough to hold an acrylic or glass top so I am able to put my lamp and clock, etc. right there but I shouldn't recommend doing this. This crate would fit anywhere in my home though so I'm thrilled. We even took it with us on vacation in our SUV instead of buying a collapsible travel crate. Two minor issues to note would be that in order to open and close the crate you will need to use two hands simultaneously and the bottom pan has many grooves so you need a thick pad in the bottom."
166748,1,"Our spaniel loves these for a midday snack, and we love that they are better for him than rawhides, not to mention they're not messy or stinky."
21461,0,"Last time I purchased these the litter provided had a scent to it. The ones I received did not. When did this change?Pros- Very convienent.Cons- No scent litter, started to smell after 1 week."
24601,2,I have 7 dogs. I thought this would keep their water fresher longer -- it doesn't. The tubing gets gross looking and the plastic container doesn't hold very much water. Not recommeded.
90475,0,"The product works reasonably well; however, the principal extension rod is very flexible and somewhat difficult to control. I believe it would be better if the rod were more sturdy and the head had a better angle, in order to allow the application of more pressure, when cleaning rocks. The rock cleaning aspect of the vacuum works fine, although the vacuum does not work as well as it might. You have to be very careful to keep it submerged, while vacuuming; otherwise, you get sprayed with the water pushing debris into the attached net. All-in-all, the product works well enough for my interests, principally cleaning the rocks in our pond; however, I would not recommend it as a vacuum, if you are intent upon vacuuming significant debris from your pond."
152814,1,This is one of our cats favorite treats. We use these as a reward for following our commands and instructions. It's a special reward. They both love them and come running at the sound of shaking the container. The price is exceptional when compared to buying at a pet store.
97067,2,"I bought this when my Rottie was 2 months old. That was 5 months ago. It was in storage all along and I dragged it out recently. Sufficit to say after all the food was consumed in what I believe was one sitting, it became a chew toy."
191760,0,"This is nice soft bedding, and our guinea pigs seem to like it just fine, but it gets expensive when it needs to be replaced every week. For this reason, we've decided to switch to fleece bedding that can be washed-- better for the planet too, and there won't be little pieces of litter on the floor."
207845,2,"Another product I tried for my indoor cat, who recently developed fleas since we moved here. He only has a few, but needed to get into action right away. After deep cleaning with flea shampoo, combing for several days, I then put this collar on. a few days later I combed him and fleas were just crawling around. None of these things seem to work. I have sprayed the carpets and stuff, I guess I will have to break down and spend the money on those drops everyone uses."
81935,0,"I bought this cover to protect my backseat from both my dog and my three year-old kid. The child car seat helps to keep the cover in place somewhat, but the two ends of it don't stay put. There are tubes sewn into the middle seam that you are meant to jam between the seat back and the bench but they pop out all the time. There are two hooks on the ends that are meant to hook under the seat, however my car doesn't allow for them.This might work better for someone with a different make/model. I have a Mercedes 350."
93335,2,"I bought this because my dog has severe separation anxiety - barking non stop, tearing up the house - severe. The vet prescribed medications, and suggested we try some DAP products, such as collars and diffusers. With the combination of medications, collar, and diffuser; my dog stays calm while I am gone (to my knowledge - nobody in my apartment has been complaining of her barking, so I am assuming that she is quiet).HOWEVER - about two weeks after her wearing the collar, I noticed a large sore. Pink and oozing some fluids. I took the collar off right away, and tried to contact adaptil - their website has only an email form and I submitted it three times, I'm not even sure that it worked. I threw the box and packaging away after I noticed improvement, so I doubt I can get a refund from amazon. I am not very happy at all - spend your money on a different DAP collar with better customer service, in case you have a problem like mine (after reading reviews, I think several dogs have developed sores from this collar)As far as working, I think it helped. But if I were to purchase a DAP collar again, it will definitely be a different brand, with better customer service."
123878,0,"There are better made leashes out there, such as the Kelty leash which I ended up buying two after purchasing this one. The Kelty leash is just a better overall product for about the same price. Will probably never use this one."

45304,2,"Too dry, too many big, thick stems that the pets don't even touch, let alone like to eat. All in all, it's not worth even the low price."
17742,0,"This product worked wonders for our Jack Russell. Unfortunately, after about 6 moths of use the device developed a leak and no longer worked properly. I also felt a little guilty because it would squirt her when she yawned or sneezed. She still tries to yawn quietly, but she is back to barking like crazy again."
139282,0,Great concept however dish is too shallow. My cats pulled the grass out by the roots. I have one more pod so I will try again and see if I get better results.
78097,1,"I purchased the small, medium, and large Air Q-Tease toys for our 3 dogs this Christmas, and they LOVE them!!! It's great because it's both a sqeaky plush toy & a rope/tug toy all in one. Plus, it comes with a squeaky tennis ball that can either be used on its own, or used as a replacement squeaker (by pushing the ball into the plush toy) once the original one has seen its day.We purchased the Medium Duck Q-Tease for our 35lb. dog, as well as for my parents 30lb dog & it's the perfect size for both of them.Overall, I would highly recommend these Air Q-Tease 3-in-1 toys. They seem to be really well made & they've been a big hit with all 3 of our dogs."
37768,0,"I was so anxious for this litter box system to work, but it's back to the drawing board. Even though it's described as ""large"", the actual space inside the box after allowing for the filter area is not so spacious. My male cat refused to venture in, but the females tried to adjust. The final straw was the litter I use (feline pine scoopable) definitely doesn't work with the tipping-over-filter system. It would probably be fine for someone with smaller cats and the usual clay clumping litter.I donated the semi-used item to the local shelter..."
2323,0,It took our pitbull less than a half hour to destroy this ball which is what he does. Based on reviews i thought this would be just the thing. I bought two and we put one away for catch but we cannot leave the dog alone with this item and have it survive.
117676,2,My dog refused to wear the boots. She repeatedly kicked them off. They did not stay on. Dogs really wear them?
136829,0,"Hi,I really liked this product but my liking was short-lived because my dog could no longer take it. this product, made my dog sick with gastritis and so I could no longer give this to him..I do not fault the company, they were very concerned and totally understood and they instructed me to call my vet and return the product. I guess my dog was just too sensitive for this product. Again, I do not blame the company!"
64054,0,"My dog loved this toy, so much he dragged me around with it right out of the package. Strangely, he even loved chewing it when we weren't playing tug. Unfortunately, it's not made entirely out of Kong rubber. It is made out of plastic where it's red...there's only a thin layer of black rubber under the handles and my dog chewed the rubber off chunks at a time! Lasted at most a month (some of it I was hiding it from him)."

67143,2,"I am a pet groomer and groom every day. Very good clipper and was very quiet for the first month. After that, the clipper started getting louder every day. The reason being that the housing is made of plastic and seeing that the blade goes at 5000 strokes per minute, everything that keeps the housing together starts breaking. The last Wahl Arco SE clipper I bought, fell apart after three months. In all my years of grooming I have never seen anything like it. Lovely clipper while it works, but at the price tag it comes with, it is impossible to replace it every three months. I don't think I want to buy another one of these and I can surely NOT recommend this to any other groomer."
139609,0,"This is such a cute little toy. Unfortunately, the donkey sound it's supposed to make doesn't work very easily. You have to whack it against something to get it to make noise. It won't ""bray"" with normal play. My dogs love toys that make noise and I have to bang it on the floor, hard, in order for it to make the noise it's supposed to. I was dissapointed."
39684,2,"I was really excited at first about this litterbox. But my cats don't like it. I have huge cats and one likes to stand really tall. Also it dosen't hold very much litter, so you do have to police it VERY frequently. (Espcially with more than one cat) My cats are also not used to any kind of covered litter box. I have no doubts though, that some people really like it. I think it would work better for small cats."
72838,2,"After spending 15 minutes using Goo Gone Sticker Lifter to try to remove the sticker residue, I realized that my life was wasting away. I tossed the container but will keep the sifter to keep this purchase from being a total loss. I'll come up with a different storage method, probably using a container made for a purpose other than holding a litter scoop. The container is cheaply made anyway. Overall, a waste of my $9.99. I find that pet products are often overpriced and made without much quality, and that assessment fits this product.On a more positive note, I love the Booda Dome litter box."

They said that they canceled the order but wouldn't give me a confirmation number or a reason as to why. They stated that I would receive a credit back to my card but that has yet to happen. I'M NOW CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE SCAMMING ME!!!Unfortunately, Visa also has customer service issues as there are no live operators to speak to when I call the number on the back of the card to dispute this purchase. The only way I can dispute this is through writing which I'll have to do but it's a pain and who knows when, or if, I'll get my money back. I will STAY AWAY FROM SMARTHOME in the future!!!!"

81263,0,"This is an okay toy for my toy poodle. He has a small mouth and can't really pick up the eggs. The one with the tree trunk and squirrels was better because he could easily pick up the squirrels by the tail or the head or the leg. It is nice though that it comes with extra eggs. I think this would be a great toy for bigger dogs who can open the stomach of the platypus to get the eggs. So there is nothing wrong with this toy, it's just not the best for a toy poodle with a small mouth."

176521,0,"I was horrified when I discovered that I had ordered the 15 oz boxes of Milk Bone dog treats again. I had promised myself I would only get the smaller boxes, because last year when I ordered these 15 oz boxes from this same seller and stored them in a plastic container for less than a month I discovered that they were populated with ugly little meal worms and webbing! It was so awful I ended up throwing out the entire container. After some discussion where the seller did not want to credit my account, Amazon took the bull by the horns and got my credit back. This time, I have carefully inspected the boxes and this batch of 15 oz seem to be OK. So we will use them, but next time I will make sure I purchase the smaller (10 oz) boxes of Milk Bone treats or even the large 40 oz plastic tubs which have always been fine, because the prior experience with 15 oz was awful. My advice - Just check them out carefully!"
76653,0,"I read reviews and decided to purchase this as the breeder had the same one and I thought my chi puppy would feel more comfortable in the same pen he was used to. The pen was smaller than I would like and after I put his bed, food bowls and covered the floor with puppy pads he had no place to do anything else. I know this is the purpose but he had to eat right next to where he did his business. So if I don't put his food bowls in there then I need to be there to let him eat and drink outside the pen which won't work for me as I am not home all day usually. I went back to my metal xpen and made it long so he can live in one end and do his business in the other end. It is working out great. The white pen is easy to put together and seems sturdy enough for a small dog. My chihuahua puppy never tried to get out although he did stand on his hind legs and hold himself up on the rails but never got out or even tried to. So if you have a very small dog and a very small bed and very small food bowls then this would be great. For me my over active chihuahua male puppy needed more room. I received it as stated without any problems and the pen was in new condition without any damage."

It was challenging to pick up and it bounced around erratically - two great toy traits for intelligent dogs. However, when the novelty of the new toy wore off, my 3 year-old Cattle Dog sat down to really chew on it. It didn't stand a chance. She ripped about half of it apart and ate the pieces, before I noticed."

112995,1,"My cat is named Larry. He is 8.372 years old and currently habitates in my abode. Two years ago, he had AIDS, then he died for a little bit. He's better now. He no longer eats or drinks water, but he's doing good. I purchased the Soft Claws for Cats with the intent of keeping Larry from accumulating the AIDS again. Some of his nails fell off as I applied the Soft Claws for Cats, it might have been because he might have been dead at the moment. I carried on anyway, I don't let small things like that get me down. Details, really. In the end, it didn't work out and I resorted to the sink garbage disposal. My neighbor called the police, but that might have been because I did the whole thing at my ex-husband's house - he has a restraining order against me. Five later, here I am."

59391,0,"We never used a flea preventer and decided at 10months we should probably start to use one. This was the first month we used the product, and 3 weeks after we started using it we found a flea on our little guy. I'm hoping it was a fluke, perhaps he just picked it out when he was outside in the grass. However, I'm having a hard time thinking the product works when we found a flea AFTER we started using the product. To be continued."
37719,0,"I do not think that this litterbox is the greatest thing since sliced bread, nor do I think the designer deserves a Nobel prize; however, I got this litterbox 4 months ago, and I've found that it does make cleaning the kitty litter considerably easier and faster. ""Self-cleaning"" is probably not the right word to describe this litterbox; what it does is allow you to separate the fresh litter from the clumps and dump the clumps into a handy, easy to remove drawer with two fairly quick tilts of the box. Whereas before I had to take the time sift the litter to look for what my kitties had left behind, I now let the box do that work for me, which means both that it takes less time and that I get all the clumps out of the litterbox everytime. Because one of my cats likes to dig to the bottom of the litterbox before doing his business, I do still end up having to scrape clumps off the bottom of the box; but I find this much easier to do with the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning box than I did with my old litterbox simply because it gets all of the clean litter out of the way, into the little grated compartment, before I start scraping, making it easy for me to find what's stuck to the bottom and to get it off before it turns into kitty litter cement. So, in terms of ease of use and convenience, this litterbox gets a big thumbs-up.My one complaint, and why I'm giving this only 3 stars (I'd give it 3.5 if I could), is that, after only four months, one of the little clips that holds the top onto the bottom has broken. Every piece of the litterbox is plastic, including the clips. From the moment I got it out of the box, I wondered how long those clips would last, and now I have my answer. Even before this clip broke, I noticed that sometimes the clips would slide out of the locked position on their own, which once or twice caused the top to gape and led to a bunch of kitty litter on the floor. I like the design of this box so much, I'll probably shell out for another one, and for now a twist tie is holding the box securely (and cheaply) shut, but it would be nice if, for the $30+ this box costs, it were a bit more durable."

99218,0,"This unit (we bought two) works as advertised but consider the following:1. We feed our cats three times per day. The 5 bins allow only for a day and a half before the cat(s) run out of food. If you go away for a three day weekend, the critter(s) get no food that last day. Reducing feedings to twice a day can solve the problem but it can throw off the animal's feeding rhythms. If you regularly go away for longer than three days, look elsewhere. This unit is not for you.2. The turntable scared the heck out of our cat when it turned while he was eating. Training the critter not to fear the turntable can take time.3. Wet cat food will dry out if left for a day or two in this unit. If your pet demands wet food, this unit may not work for you.Other than that, it works well, programs easily (although the instructions are unnecessarily complex) and cleans easily."

213023,1,"I am HIGHLY allergic to cats I found out AFTER I got one. I was tested by an allergist with a scratch test and scored a 3/4 for cat dander. What a lot of people don't know is that we are allergic to the protein in cat's saliva, not their hair. But cat's are constantly licking and grooming themselves so the dander gets on their hair, then sheds around the house.So I bought Allersearch allergy spray, pet shampoo, and Allerpet solution to wipe on the cat.Now to be honest, I'm not sure how well this shampoo really works in helping my allergies. I seem to always be allergic to my cat but take antihistamines every day, bought a $900 IQ air purifier, Miele vacuum with a hepa filter, and have done everything possible to lessen allergies. But this shampoo does smell wonderful. I bathe my cat with it once a week to try and reduce the allergens on his fur, so yes I'd recommend it."

9894,0,"Firstly the cage is okay, not great at all. The tube access covers don't fit properly and are easy for hamsters to remove, we had to tape the covers in place. The bottom tray is too low and quickly leads to a mess surrounding the cage. It does the job and is astatically pleasing; except for the tape I had to put on the tube cover. A solid three star product, nothing to brag about.My main issue is with B&J; Pets and Aquariums, Inc. who are selling USED as new. The cage I received was clearly a return that had an animal in it before. Old bedding fell out of the box soon as I opened it, as well as there being small scratches on the base from an animal trying to dig. (Amazon won't let me post review of the seller since they use an Amazon warehouse, so I am posting it here.) Not worth returning, but I am not happy about buying a new product only to receive a USED one."

179038,0,"I ordered this for my cat a week almost 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately, I had not been using flushable cat litter for the 10 years I have had her. So I used the regular for the first week to get her used to going on the toilet seat. That worked okay, but when it came time to remove a ring, I'm looking all over the place to figure out just how am I supposed to do this?? I thought each section would just lift out and wonder why they didn't design it this way. It would make so much more sense. Then I found the perforation. Are you kidding me? I'd like to know how everybody else is getting those things out as I almost broke the scissors just trying to create a wedge. The bottom seat was bad enough, but the one the cat actually SITS on, well.........let me tell you it was a nightmare!!! The concept is great, BUT the design is completely flawed. I could build one better myself by just LIFTING out each ring. 3 stars for the concept and too early to tell if my cat will use it now especially since I had to change to flushable litter."
87028,0,"Even though this is a 2 piece product, it should fit together better than mine did. My pieces would not fit together flush so I used super glue on it. It's on the window and I hope it works out. I'll give it a 4 if it stays together and up thru the spring."

157657,2,"First off, it's as if the makers designed this bottle to waste as many drops as possible. With the pricethey're charging, that's a major problem. Every time I shake it (with the top on) drops STILL come out the top and dribble down the bottle. I wonder how much $ I just wasted. When I try to put the drops in my dogs eyes, more drops come out and dribble down the bottle or squirt on to their faces. No, I'm not squeezing hard or anything, I'm just holding the bottle upside down. I was using Petvision, which has a good bottle that measure out a drop at a time. My dog was starting to see things (she had gone completely blind). We were both excited! Thinking Ocluvet must be better because it had studies backing it, and was more expensive, I switched. In just three days she's back to bumping into everything and walking around with that dazed look. Not a good trade for either of us."

44207,2,"My dog hates drinking stagnant water. I had to change her water bowls at least 3x a day. I figured I'll solve my problem with this little cool invention...After sitting for a bit, the ""filter"" proved useless when dust and little odds and ends are floating in it, obviously NOT being filtered.... also, just because the water is supposedly SLOWLY circulating, doesn't mean the water is ""fresh."" I literally felt compelled to take this thing apart once per day to clean, and even then, break it down at least 2-3x a week to thoroughly get in the nooks and crannies... not an easy job when you cant really get into the water reservoir where I imagine all sorts of mildew and mold, bacteria and algae will eventually accumlate.A BIG waste of money, a HUGE waste of time, an even LARGER inconvenience.I'm back to my old ways of changing both her indoor and outdoor water bowls at least 3x a day, whenever I walk pass it, and just washing a simple bowl out at the ened of the night... cheaper that way too... no electricity to use, no fear of electrocutng my doggy, no pricey carbon filters to buy.Used it for 2 weeks and now its in another ""bad buy"" pile...."
89529,0,"Pros: Value. For about $5 you really can't go wrong, if one season is all you're looking for.Cons: Quality.

68818,0,"I purchased the PetQwerks Babble Ball Toy ""Small."" When I picked up the package, I immediately heard the ball making noise and then concluded it had been ""on"" its entire trip to my house (at least 3 days?). On the packaging it says to ""remove plastic strip to activate"" but I'm assuming this had already been done. Needless to say, the batteries are on their last limb. So now I have to go out and buy the battery after not even having the toy for a week. For the short week of use, my puppy loved it. WARNING when purchasing this item that you'll need to buy 1.5 volt button cell batteries very soon after. Which is about the same price as the ball ($5-$6)."
156820,0,"I'll reiterate what I feel like many reviewers have said - if your dog is a chewer this will be a one-time treat dispenser. I bought this for my 55lb pup and it was destroyed within the hour. Smaller dogs may like this, but if you have a dog that likes to chew and gnaw this will be a terrible investment."

190001,0,"I bought two of these beds over 18 months ago. At that point, we had two ""medium"" dogs that weighed about 30 and 35 lbs. The beds were perfect for them. Six months ago, we got a German Shepherd puppy, who has grown to about 70lbs. He loves to jump onto the bed. I had to start tightening the bolts every few days, which I have found out is not only due to them loosening, but also because the bolts are actually ""stretching"". One stretched to about 1/2 the thickness that it was originally (right above the threads) and just broke on the last tightening. I know the bed shouldn't have to survive a 70lb GSD ""puppy"" jumping on it, but I'm disappointed that the bolts are not made of ""hardened"" material. They should not stretch. Luckily, I have two beds and will use one for parts and hopefully get a few more months out of it.This bed would be so much better if the manufacturer had two parallel rails on each of the three sides instead of just one. This would minimize the stress at the bolts. That actually just gave me the idea to try to build one ""frankenbed"" out of the two beds I have."
105133,1,My Labrador loved it. Bought the large one for his kennel and it fits all right. It looks good quality. Had it washed and didn't come appart.
177299,1,"I was hesitant in purchasing an e-collar for my dog, however this system works (have had it since the summer of 2010). The key is consistency with training and the proper fit. I purchased this after watching my stubborn beagle/bull dog mix charge other dogs entering the dog park as he was becoming way too comfortable and territorial with the park. He normally listens when I call him, however he feels the need to greet new dogs in a dominant manner as to let them know who's the boss at the park. Dogs that he knows he's fine with so it's not that he's dog aggressive - just dominant. If he was close by, voice recall would work, however given enough distance he would zone me out and no amount of calling would get him to come. Using this collar worked! Once I caught his signs of him focusing in on a new dog I would call him once and that was enough with the collar (after he got ""reminded"" the first few times when I started working with him and the collar). This even worked when we would go to our friends house where he would burst through their front door and head straight for their dog's food. With the collar, after a few ""reminders"" all I would need to do is give the command to ""leave it"" and he would turn away from the food bowl. But primarily, I purchased this as I saw that my stubborn dog was starting the scuffles at the dog park because I was unable to control him from a distance. Now I am able to have the confidence in my recall because he knows there are consequences when he doesn't come when called. After talking with a few other dog park friends and reading the reviews of other collars, I decided to purchase this one in the price range, and would suggest not going any lower in price as spending the extra money seem to work better, battery holds the charge longer and works at a good distance. He does seem to know when the collar is placed on him, he listens more!! I am able to take him off leash at the beach (during off season) and he can run freely which he loves (plus this collar is waterproof)! Great value for the price and peace of mind. On a side note, I tested the collar on myself just to see what ""reminder"" it would give, and the setting at 3 (out of 10) was definitely an uncomfortable zap but not harmful, and that's where I found it was effective for my dog as well. Definitely read the instructions so you can transition this smoothly for your dog and yourself."
214108,2,I can't imagine why this feeder works for other reviewers. On our deck the squirrels jump on it. The small ones are not heavy enough to Close the feeder. The bigger ones hang down from the perch and munch away.I also have the problem of the seeds shifting to the back. I finally bought a Brome SquirrelBuster Plus from amazon And it's perfect. Better construction and has not hosted one squirrel.
131604,1,"This toy lasts longer than a standard Frisbee, but does not fly nearly as well and has a semi-tough learning curve to toss it and for a dog to learn the trajectory of the toy versus another disc.

67574,0,"Cute house, but the workmenship not that great. Glue is visable were they have the trimming on the side panels. Try to assemble the house was bit interesting. There are no holes on all the side panels to screw the nails in. You just have to be very careful to make sure you adjust the sides correctly before you screw the nails into the wood. There are no screws for the bottom piece of the house to connect to the side panels. I guess it is a good idea, because if the dog makes a mess, you can clean it. Lift the house clean it and then put it back on top of the base."

They love the squeaker sound the balls make and enjoy these over regular tennis balls. However, they easily destroy the squeaker. Its a small plastic piece near the surface which the dogs teeth will eventually push in and then no more squeak; then its just a regular tennis ball. This seems like something that could easily be redesigned, Kong..As an alternative, I've used the JW rubber squeaker ball, the squeaker does last longer, but the JW ball is heavier than these light Kong tennis ball."

170526,0,"I just received the Large Lounger bed and was disappointed to find the cover didn't zip off, nor was it big and fluffy as mentioned in two of the previous reviews.I called PetSupply to make sure I had received the correct bed, which, according to the helpful man I spoke to, did. Perhaps I misunderstood the review where the cover zips off. Maybe it 'zips' off, meaning it can be removed quickly, as opposed to having a cover with a zip!(?) It certainly isn't big and fluffy, etiher, as one reviewer said. It is made of orthopaedic grade foam, which doesn't appear to look as though it will support my 65lb Boxer, but he is now lounging quite happily on it! I do have a bed with polyester fill underneath the foam bed, to add comfort, which I used with his last bed. Only time will tell if the foam holds up. Maybe in 2 months I'll write another review.This is not to say I am disappointed with the bed, as it is too early to say, just that I was disappointed with the reviews that prompted me into buying it.So be aware, it is not big and fluffy; it is the size specified, 36"" x 24"" x 7"" (which includes the bolster part) with a firm piece of sculpted foam and an elasticized cover that, like a bed sheet, tucks under the 'mattress' part of the (dog) bed, enabling you to quickly remove it for washing."

Eventually the dial will start to rotate too far and the pins will all fall out of their guides. Putting them back is a pain. Replacement doors are sold separately ($25 to $30), probably because they are not very sturdy in the first place. So expect to eventually need a replacement door if you use it frequently."

This comes out to much less than $5 per day, and results in a much, much healthier and happier tegu.3 ounces of turkey with 1 ounce of beef liver -> 50 cents/day4 ounces of fish filet -> 90 cents/day2 large eggs -> 20 cents/day2 rats -> $2/dayThat means for between 70 cents, and $2.50 you can feed your tegu a much healthier meal than this."
195712,0,"My 2-year-old cat Miko played with these a little at first, but now she either ignores them or runs away from them when I try to play with her. She's a bit shy and weird at times, so it really does depend on the cat if they will like this toy or not. She'd much rather play with a crumpled-up piece of paper, but that's just how my cat is; your cat may love these. I do think the springs are cute, though, and I will probably give them to a friend for their cat or a shelter."
86045,2,At first the coats look good and good material probably good for smaller dogs. The hoods don't fit right so my dogs heads get wet. I ordered a larger one for my smaller dog and I have to do some alterations so she does not trip over it. I did it so the hood would fit her head better. It does not even fit the male dog I have on the hood part. Well at least it keeps the rain off the back side. I wish someone would make a rain coat that the hood fit and the whole body is covered. Hate when they get wet.

51521,1,"We'd had a Staywell Pet Door for a few years and finally it was time to replace it. I had been so happy with that pet door that I wanted to replace it with exactly the same thing. Four Pet Stores later(including the one I had originally purchased it from) I was still unable to find one. So I turned to the internet and found it on Amazon and had four different merchants I could order it from. It was here in 4 days, fit exactly into the previous opening and 2 cats and 2 dogs are happy again. It's a bit more costly than some other dog doors but no rubber to get brittle in the cold and break off as this door is clear hard plastic which withstands our cold Pacific NW winters and outlasted any other we had tried over the years. I hope to always have a Staywell Pet Door for my animals- Highly Recommend!"

171594,0,"I purchased this cover for my Black Lab about 3 months ago after getting tired of cleaning up the bed sheet I was using to cover the back seat. My car does not have the same style of headrests as pictured in the photos so I knew that I was taking a chance when ordering this hoping it would fit. After using some of my own straps in conjunction with the seat, it does not fit the greatest but still manages to cover about 85% of what I want covered back there. I like the fact it's easier to clean and also semi-water resistant. If you have the upright headrests, I think you'll be happy with the purchase."
131717,0,"This treat pouch is ok, but I wish it was less cumbersome to open/close. When training or walking a dog, you often only have one hand free. I wish this pouch was able to be opened with one hand. It's possible, but takes quite a while, which defeats the purpose. And if you leave the drawstring open, the treats fall out, so that's not an option."
95695,0,The rake is teeny tiny for this large size pan and then in the pet stores you can get a smaller pan with a larger rake. It makes no sense!

204217,0,"I got this to entertain my 1-year-old puppy but she figured it out pretty quickly. I think it might be better for a cat. She chased it for about a minute before she figured out the ""pretty light"" was coming from mom's hand...then she just wanted to get that instead of the light. So I'm thinking I wasted my money on this one. I guess I'll stick with the dog bubbles....she loves to chase them."
68199,1,"Don't be like me and wait too long to learn that the ingredients contained in the standard flake or pellet food are inadequate.I have a few larger sized fantail goldfish in a 40 gallon tank. Since I am a casual fish owner I just always assumed the flake food and pellets contained the correct ingredients to provide a fish with a balanced diet.I was wrong. And, now I am looking at my most favorite fish in the tank next to me sitting on the bottom of the tank suffering with constipation.For months this fish would swim and lay upside down. It was upside down as much as it was right side up. It wasn't until it stopped swimming altogether that I realized I had neglected to balance it's diet properly and it is severly constipated.Brine shrimp are recommended to prevent this condition. And, your fish won't necessarily exhibit clear signs like mine did.So, add this item to your fishes diet and do them a favor. My fish love it, and go crazy when it hits the water. Time will tell if I waited too long for the upside swimming fish.In my opinion there are a lot of fillers in this product. It is difficult to tell by the label (see below) since I don't know the make-up of brine shrimp, just basing that on appearance. But, there is a product out there that is not in chunk form and is not grey-ish in color. It is pure, freeze dried brine shrimp. No fillers. When you open the bottle there are literally small shrimp you take out one by one to feed the fish. I won't mention the brand or store out of respect for this product, because it works great also!Crude Protein: Min 55%Crude Fat: Min 7%Crude Ash: Max 18%Crude Fiber: Max 3%Moisture: Max 7%"

140133,1,My dog just loves this bed and I love it because I now have my bed back. Sharing a full size bed with a 90 lb dog just wasn't cutting it. I would wake up hanging off the bed and the dog would be sprawled out on the rest of it. Since I got this bed she has her space and I have mine.

207241,0,"My two female rats, both still very young, tore this item apart in four days. They loved it; they constantly wrestled in it and one of them found it very useful for hiding food in. However, it did not hold up to one of my rat's constant burrowing habits. Within the first day my rat had dug the fleece up from the bottom and chewed holes in the corners. I discovered today, after having the tent for 4 days, one of them had chewed through the inner lining of the tent and was tunneling between the inside and outer layers of fabric.In short, my rats loved this item TOO much. I was disappointed by the lack of durability, especially with the great reaction I got from my rats. I personally will not be purchasing another tent, but I believe this item is worth a try, unless you know your rats to be especially fond of burrowing."
102186,2,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.TRY THIS INSTEAD:Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag"
63517,2,"I bought 3 of these things, only to constantly keep fixing them, then tossing them in the trash over the years. I kept hoping it would be made better or improved, but it is always poorly made for the long-haul of reeling in the kitties. The cats definitely love this though, but I'm not buying anymore. It's just too pricey.If you do buy it, be ready with needlenose pliers to take apart the reel and keep fixing it because you'll have to do that. Then there's the black gunk from the grease you'll get all over yourself too. Ugh...I still have one, but can't bring myself to fix it again because of the black gunk I'll get under my nails again."
167379,0,"This is just okay. I have begun to loathe the ladder. Fish keep getting stuck, and it won't be long before I find someone dead. I have switched out the ladder for an air stone.Instead of buying the refills that Hagen sells, I started using my own recipe. I follow the normal directions (fill sugar to the first line, fill lukewarm water to the second) and use 1/4 tsp of bread maker's yeast. For $8 you can get a jar of yeast that will last you forever. (just make sure to check the expiration date on the yeast, and maybe start a bread-making hobby just in case) Some people also add baking soda to counter the production of alcohol, which lowers the pH and eventually drowns the yeast, but I have not yet figured out the right amount. This will last about 2-3 weeks, depending.Injecting CO2 caused my extremely soft water to become extremely acidic water, but after I fixed my kH problems, everything works fine. I used baking soda to increase kH without altering the gH.PROS: easy setup, tight seal to prevent leaks and CO2 wastageCONS: fish and dwarf shrimp get caught behind the ladder, not as cheap as the soda bottle method"
149639,0,"I purchased this one and the BioCare flea trap at the same time. the light bulb has already blown out of this and it has not been one week. Additionally, there is no cover, so to speak over the sticky pad thereby allowing cat hair to stick as well as the fleas. I am not sure the sticky will last as long as the other one as there is a &#34;hair catcher&#34; over the sticky pad. both are catching fleas in a space that has had the carpet treated and has been bombed. If you are going to purchase a flea trap, I would recommend the other brand."
33774,0,I thought this jacket was really nice but was disappointed that the site did not give measuring instructions.

NEVER again a Marineland product!"

125371,1,"A great toy for my dog, precisely because it DOESN'T squeak. It makes a honking noise (presumeably because it's a goose) which still gets my dog excited, but doesn't annoy me. Moderately durable. A dog that destroys other toys will do the same to this one."

136568,2,"I just recently purchased a litter robot LRII hoping that it would make the daily chore of cleaning the cat box a little easier. I read all the reviews on the other self cleaning litter boxes and I felt the litter robot was the way to go from what other customers had to say. I felt the price was a little high but i figured you get what you pay for and i liked the way the black one looked. So i purchased it and received it promptly from amazon. I opened the large box and took out the large globe (make sure to check the measurements its pretty big)and assembled the machine which was very easy. I set it up in the spot where i had planned and plugged it in. I have two cats a black tuxedo coat (franky) and a blue russian (blue) both are very spoiled. Franky knew i got him a new toy and couldnt wait to jump in. I filled it with litter and hit the cycle button and it started to do its thing, I was surprised how noisy it was..but I figured i would get used to it and since i wouldnt have to scoop anymore i could live with it. Well when it finished its cycle Franky jumped right in did his thing and jumped out bringing a lot of litter with him which went onto the floor. This is when fun started when the timer finished and the globe started to turn Franky became curious and wanted to get back into his toy which set off the sensor starting the timing process again which didnt alow the litter robot to deposit the waste into the drawer, I had this problem a lot so my robot was constantly cycling making a lot of loud noise which is not good when trying to sleep. Coming home from work I hoped that I would not smell the litter box anymore like i had with my old scoop box..i was wrong it still smelled just as much so i was constantly cleaning the drawer out not having to scoop which was nice but still doing the same amount of labor with changing out the bags..and i should also say that drawer begins to stink even with no waste in it. So overall the design and concept of the litter robot is nice but it is too noisy especially with curious cats, and it smells just as bad as a regular cat box with just as much work involved with cleaning it..I recommend saving the $300 and get a nice scooper."
35407,0,"Like the title says, my rats go nuts for these things. But after looking at the ingredients list I saw they had hydrogenated oils, which are very bad. So I'm letting my rats finish them off, but after that I will not buy them again. But it seems like most treats on the market have the same ingredients. Also they melted together during shipping so it's like one giant block of yogurt treat. All in all, they are ok, but unhealthy and melty."
75260,1,I have used this for several years now. It keeps my babies fresh and clean smelling. Actually I think it lasts longer than that used at my groomer.
36969,2,"I bought a case of 12 only to find that my dogs can destroy this thing in 5 minutes flat. I placed dry food inside, which came out relatively easily as it rolled - however my 3 labs are very adept at these kinds of toys. After it was empty, they each easily tore through the plastic to look inside. Not fun... On a plus side, the orange plastic is easy to spot to clean up. Unfortunately, this ball proved too big for my mother's small dog - which leaves me to wonder - what's the perfect dog for this thing? However, we really like the soft feature, which is nice for inside non-carpeted play. A medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy. For aggressive chewers or sharp-teeth puppies the Buster Food Cube is a better choice and comes in multiple sizes."

211196,0,"Bought this item so our Maltipoo could come up onto our bed at night on his own without bugging us to pick him up. However the steps are not very sturdy and our dog is not confident enough to use it. We've made several attempts to train him with treats but I think it is just not sturdy enough for him. Also, we have a very small bedroom so I was hoping we could collapse the steps daily when not in use. But, the plastic bits that hold the steps in the upright position do not look like they will stand up to repeated collapsing. It looks like it will break very easily. We'll keep trying to get our doggie to use the steps and at least get our $ out of it. But, I don't think I would make this purchase again."
32962,2,"I've owned Drinkwell's in the past and never had an issue like I did with this one. It leaked water and rather quickly. Within 4 hours, I had to empty the tray (IKEA plastic one) because it had filled with water. I just did the same thing again a few hours later and then unplugged it. It's a shame, because my cat does like to drink from it, but it helps if it keeps the water IN the fountain and not outside of it. Bummer.For those who complained about the noise, if there isn't enough water, it does make a grinding noise. Otherwise, the gurgling water is a nice sound."

Very dentist-office-y, but sometimes that's what you're going for!"
73128,0,"While this stuff does smell quite unpleasant, it isn't unbearable for me, and my kitty absolutely hates it. Sometimes I'll spray areas of our carpet where I see her scratching. And while it does repel her, the effects don't really last that long, and I usually have to end up spraying twice a day. I do spray quite generously. It does work at repelling cats from certain areas, and I will keep repurchasing, until I can find something a little more long-lasting."

33823,1,"Below is my review from the previous SUV model by Kittywalk. It had a green, blue and red striped. I was very pleased with the previous model and this one is an improvement. If needed, though I never had the need, there are cup holders. The flashing safety lights are a peculiar addition, I imagine it is handy if you walk at night.This was a Christmas gift from a very, very good friend. I am sooo loving this, but not as much as my 'babies' do. My 2 hairless (yeah, no hair) cats are both rescues, and as such I feel I must push more people to adopt a pet, rather than 'buy' one. When I took my kids to various events they used to have a basket they traveled in, which , at the time, they were pleased with. But being in the basket, they were not able to get away from prying hands or just get out of their own limelight. With the stroller's back area covered, they can get privacy when they want, or as my boy Samson does, lay stretched out, half in the covered and half in the open mesh area. It is nice not have to carry that basket or have them bothered by a leash tugging on them. They get to feel they have their own freedom to be seen, which I think is why my babies are so easy going when out and about in the public eye.It is big enough to fit two nice blankets inside the carrier for them to snuggle on/under as well as have both kitties in at the same time and even the dog too. I have used it when I needed my bird to stay out of my hair, she seemed less annoyed being in the stroller then when in the carriers I have stuck her in. Maybe because she has more visibility, so it eases her already unbalanced state of mind! It would work for most any animal, so long as they are bigger than the mesh screens. The wheels are very sturdy, as far as I have noticed, and get around with ease. The folding base/wheel section, not sure how to describe that, is very minimal in its space when folded, fits very well in trunk, I have a PT Cruiser. The carrier is not so easy to break down, you can do that to store it in the trunk, but have to 'rebuild' every time you go out. But the carrier does fit quite nicely in the PT. If you have a sedan or something smaller, you will not have as easy a time keeping it in the vehicle. Their are few nice little compartments in back for leashes or whatever to be stored. I do wish they had a bar or something on the handle area to hang a purse, that is my only issue.The stroller has been a quite a topic anywhere I am with it, this is a good thing. I have had many inquire about it, including a woman with 6, YEAH, 6 Ferrets. I would highly recommend this item to anyone wanting to have their pet out and about with them. But do remember to get your baby used to the thing before your first adventure. I left ours open in the living area and the kitties sniffed it out and eventually both enjoyed just hanging out in it.As I did 5 years ago, I still highly recommend this stroller for anyone wanting to take the pet with them on excursions."

Amazon sent me out a new collar and I used them again and the other collar broke. It is too bad they are so poorly made, because they did work. I can't believe both collars broke only after two or three uses. The collars did not get wet and the dogs were just out in my backyard. I would not waste your money on these. They need to improve the quality of them or charge 5.00 so you are not throwing away almost 40.00 on something that works for such a short period of time. Save your money and do not buy this cheap product."

My current cat watches the whole thing, and will even watch the blank TV screen, hoping it will come back on (see images)! I think most cats will watch this video, but the amount of time and amount of interaction will vary from cat to cat. The trick is to tap on the TV screen once the DVD is playing to get their attention...I doubt most cats will notice it on their own otherwise. Love it!"
7460,0,"The idea behind this seems sound, but in reality, my cat still tracks as much litter out of this as he would otherwise. In fact, when he jumps to get out of the box, he kicks up a fair amount of litter he probably wouldn't otherwise.

This vest has stood the test of racing through underbrush and thorns, through snow and rain...so far it has come through everything unscathed.The straps are only what is needed to keep the vest secure, but not to impede her movement, and contour to her body so as not to catch on anything along the way. It provides enough visibility from all sides that she can be seen - important for a little dog the color of fallen oak leaves!While there are more expensive vests out there, this one does everything we want for a small price - no splurging needed!"

12491,0,"My dogs like these treats well enough. My question is regarding the amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin that they incorporate.According to what I'm looking at, you need around 300-500mg of each per 25lbs of dog, per day. The bag ingredients says 2000mg/kg of glucosamine and 1000mg/kg of chondroitin. So that means my 100lb dog would need to eat 2lbs of this treat every day to get a satisfactory dose, since a kg is 2.2lbs.Reading the reviews of the various versions of this treat, I'm also wondering how much of the perceived results are scientifically due to the supplements. I see a lot of people noting improvements and results in a week or two, yet glucosamine and chondroitin are supposed to take 4-6 weeks before they produce a noticeable benefit.For our big, fat, old dogs, we've had good luck with the vetrin chewable aspirin for dogs. They like them, they're inexpensive, and they do a nice job of taking the squeak and creak out of the dogs."

It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance, instead of all over the room.Gives the cats privacy.Keeps the smell down a bit.Cons:It's difficult to get the zipper closed.The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question).It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps, so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day)."

174830,0,"My results with this 'brush' is that it moves fur around much as if massaging by hand. What hair does stick to the brush is difficult to remove, as it's sort of stuck on the material. During baths, it seems my hand does a better job of massaging the shampoo in, and the hair that comes off the dog gets stuck in the drain strainer rather than on the brush where it's a pain to remove. Was hoping it would at least have some effect on my little terrier, but it seems I get more loose fur by just rubbing my hands around and then brushing.UPDATE: The ZoomGroom helps loosen the undercoat prior to grooming the German Shepherds with undercoat rakes. It also helps scrub hair off very short haired dogs. When dry the fur that is retained on the ZoomGroom just falls off with a shake. DO NOT use for baths as the fur sticks miserably to the ZoomGroom when wet.Here are the fur grooming tools I've found useful:Dog 1 and 2 - German Shepherds very thick medium length coat with heavy undercoat.groomed best with double row undercoat rake and then slicker.Dog 3 - terrier mix short fur single coat almost hairless.best grooming tool bristle brush.Dogs 4 and 5 - super furry Pomeranians with fluffy undercoat.single row rake and then pin brush."

17993,2,"The citronella bark collar seems to work, so far. But so did the Innotek when I first put it on our Jack Russell, but she learned to ignore the tingle. The one drawback I see with this product is it is not weather proof, there is no cap to cover the refill nozzle and the battery is not protected from moisture or dirt. This will be a problem since our girl, Dot, is an outdoor dog and she will fill it with dirt and mud. Plus it appears that the unit will need frequent refilling.UPDATE:According to the Amazon description, the collar has been discontinued.After initial success, Dot now barks once then quickly turns her head to avoid the spray. She continues to do so until the reservoir is empty, then continues on with her barking.The enclosed battery lasted less than a month and when I replaced it, sure enough, the compartment was full of dirt.Score: Dot 1 --- Citronella spray 0"
95585,0,"I bought these scissors to trim around the ears and eyes of my dogs. I would say for the price, the quality is just average, and the sharpness could have been better. I have a pair of the round tip scissors I had gotten at a local drug store for much less to use on people, and I would say the quality is just as good (if not better). These scissors are lightweight, but the opening for the fingers is a bit small, and they don't seem to have any bulk to them...thus feeling flimsy. I will need to sharpen them before I use them again.Regarding the case they came in. It's okay, but I know over time, the snap is going to break off as it doesn't feel like it's great quality either.Overall, they rate to me as just average. I really think you can do just as well buying these type of scissors at a local drug store or discount store (Target, K-Mart, WalMart), or even at a discount beauty supply store for lots less...perhaps saving $5 or more. That's just my opinion. Hope this helped you decide what to do."

The inside is cream sherpa, with the outside being a color (black in this case, but it comes in blue, burgundy, green, red and khaki as well...). The cover easily unzips to be removed for washing, which is this beds best feature.The foam is not like memory foam, but it's solid. Despite the cover the foam does pick up hair. I have a black lab and her hair seems to go through the sherpa and stick in the foam.The bed does hold its shape even with a heavy 55 pound dog using it every day, but the cover is tough to get on and off. It kind of sticks to the foam instead of easily sliding on and off.I guess if I could change the design I'd put some kind of nylon liner on the foam to resolve the issues I have with the bed. I also think the price is a bit high, and I will probably not buy another one. Instead I'll buy the pillow type bed, if nothing else for easy removal and replacement of the cover."

When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak.

So I wanted to try Frontline because it claims to be a tick control.Well, it is, kinda. I assumed that Frontline would be something that would give him an aura of ""keep away from me"" for fleas and ticks, much like Pig-Pen's dirt aura did for him in Charlie Brown. However, it doesn't. Now, Bob comes home with ticks, only...they're clinging to the outside of his hair. They won't crawl in and attach, but they're clinging to his hair, and as such, unless I find them when he comes in, they may detach at any time. Since he likes to join us in bed after we're asleep and he's done his nightly field mouse hunt, this is especially troublesome.I don't know what else to do, other than use those nasty flea/tick collars, which I don't want to do. But I suppose since the ticks won't crawl into his hair, technically it's ""control."""
143241,2,"I have had a Littermaid for about 2 and a half years. I love the convenience of being able to let my 2 cats use the box and clean it only weekly. The motor has functioned perfectly over the lifetime of the box, and I reuse the plastic receptacles until they break. The only problem is the cheap construction of the rake. The wheels break off of the end of the rake without fail after around 6 months. I am currently on my 4th rake. You can order them from their Fox International website for $40 a pop. Each rake gets assessed a $10 shipping fee, so ordering 2 will cost the same which is an incredible rip off. After 3 rakes, you have essentially paid to replace the box. I keep ordering them though, due to the convenience of the box."

96679,0,"Why I bought this bed:I am super picky about dog beds. I want something that is going to provide my two large dogs (85 and 100 lbs) with a comfortable sleep. They are aging, so pampering them with a superior, comfortable dog bed is top priority for me. Also, the ideal dog bed should have strong, durable covers that keep water/slobber/stink/etc out of the bedding. I look for dog beds that are functional, easy to keep clean, and look nice in your home.I looked and looked for the perfect bed. I was very hopeful when I finally decided on these beds (I ordered 2). However, I received them today and can say there is definitely room for improvement- primarily in the cover.First, let me preface this review by pointing out that this bed used to be marketed by Simmons (the human mattress maker), but the product was spun off to a company called Pet Goods Manufacturing & Imports not long ago. Perhaps the bed was manufactured to higher standards under the Simmons name??? Maybe that is why so many people have given it such *glowing* reviews in the past??Let's start with the construction of the bed itself. It was a little misleading. Since it was made by Simmons and marketed as a coil spring mattress, I thought it was going to be like a human bed. However, I could not find any detailed information on the construction, so I thought I would order them and give them a try. They are not like human mattresses. Basically it is a 1"" foam sheet with strips of 5"" thick foam set around the edges, which forms a foam box structure. Inside that box are the coil springs and who knows what else (the company doesn't provide this info anywhere). On top of this is a 1.75"" foam sheet. All of these pieces are glued together to form a foam rectangle mattress. This foam block is placed into a nylon cover (zippered), and then into the outer cover (zippered).Here is my opinion:1) Mattress- The foam mattress does seem to be very sturdy. The coil structure gives it much more support than a regular slab of foam. Overall, I would give the foam mattress 4.0 - 4.5 stars. (Keep in mind I just got it out of the box. We will see how it wears over time.)2) Waterproof cover- Not bad, but not spectacular. Just a thin, plain, black nylon cover with a zipper. The zipper seams are not serged, so it is only a matter of time before they fray or tear. I immediately took this into my sewing room and reinforced this seam.3) Outer cover- ***JUNK! ABSOLUTE JUNK!*** There are so many flaws. I sew professionally, so I can easily recognize poor quality. Here are the problems:a) The bottom of the cover is tissue-thin nylon. I mean really, really thin. Super thin. This material is not acceptable for ANY dog bed, let alone one that costs $150-$200. When I took it out of the box and examined it, I noticed there are already a few places where the material has started to rip at the seams. Won't last more than a few days. Once these covers rip (and they will...soon), you are just left with a plain hunk of foam.b) Color- Whoever decided to make this cover in off-white has obviously never had a dog. Off-white stains and shows dog hair. Horrible choice.c) Poorly made- Lots of loose threads, loose seams, cord accent was already fraying.d) Appearance- Looks like a bare mattress. Who wants a bare mattress lying around their house?THE BOTTOM LINE:The mattress is decent. Probably a good buy. However, the covers are junk. I plan to sew new ones tomorrow. If I couldn't make covers for myself, I would have returned these beds. If you buy this bed, I suggest you find someone to make new, durable covers (just Google ""custom dog bed covers""). Otherwise, just go buy a high quality crib mattress for your pooch.Message to the Manufacturer:Improve the covers! People who are willing to pay $200 for a premium dog bed are willing to pay an extra $20 for a good cover. It bothers me that I paid $400 for these beds and still have to spend my time and money making decent covers.(It is an interesting side note that the mattress is made in America, but the covers are made in China. And they are poor quality, even by Chinese standards. The difference in quality between the items is vast.)"

He ended up SCREAMING, he didn't make the connection between barking and being zapped, he thought he was being attacked, it seemed like it was going on for eternity, the worst day ever for everyone involved, we tried to call and calm him down so he would stop screaming which would turn the collar off but he didn't care to listen, he kept running like a mad dog, screaming and getting shocked even more. We tried to catch him (carefully as to not scare him more) but it was impossible, he got crazy, he tried to bite us, he ran around the house in circles and pooped and peed all over, ALL OVER THE HOUSE, every single room was ruined. There is a timer, and the collar stopped zapping him after 3 minutes. We were able to approach the dog and take this thing off. It was too late, we all got tortured including the dog in addition to that I had pretty nasty and smelly carpets to clean. ""Pet safe"" collar????? WHAT? Please read reviews, the same experience described by a few customers here, it can kill your dog. Those who designed this device need to get lost. We got citronella collar which worked wonderfully.

The teeth are wide and they don't flex.Construction is nice, but how does it work, right? Well, IT WORKS! I have a German Shepherd, and in 20 minutes I got enough hair out of her to make a pile that was BIGGER than she is...and there was still some left. It was all undercoat hair - the stuff that's hard to get out. This thing is awesome and worth the $30+. My dog has pretty short hair, and I wasn't sure if I would benefit from it, but it works great. No more blowing undercoat all over the black rug in the living room.My dog's reaction was also positive. She liked the brushing - stood still for as long as I kept brushing - I also notice less panting now (it's summer and I'm sure getting all that hair out cooled her off)."

126920,2,"It seems strange that this feeder is billed as having a no-drip base. I've had one hung out for about a month on a branch, and as it sways in the wind, the ""flowers"" drip water very quickly - so fast that it only takes 3-5 days to empty completely, even though it's apparently too early in the season to attract any birds. The flowers, which are detachable, are a press fit into holes about 1/4 inch in diameter. This fit is not water-tight, so in addition to losing water from the small feeding holes in the center of the flowers, water seeps readily from the larger holes around the base of each flower with the slightest tilt of the feeder. I've just glued the flowers in place with silicone cement to eliminate that source of drip, and perhaps that will reduce the problem to some extent, but at the cost of being unable to replace the flowers in the future. I've also removed it from the branch and hung it from a solid structure to try to reduce the swaying. Perhaps these fixes will save it from the garbage bin, but given that this is one of the more expensive feeders, I'm quite disappointed with it."

172424,0,"I agree these are somewhat expensive - I wish they'd improve these by making it easier to lift a full one out to throw away. I don't know if that's something on the littermaid itself that should be improved, or the design of these to include a handle of something on each side that sticks up so you can pull a heavy/full one up and out of the box. I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it, and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle. They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw."
92132,1,"The Cat Charmer is my three cats' favorite toy. They love to romp around after the multicolored flannel tail.

60237,0,"Good idea BUT the shipping is a rip off. I purchased 4 packages ofFrontline Plus. The seller did NOT combine the shipping, which would still have cost the same as the shipping for one. The actual postage to mail the package was under $5.00, BUT I got charged $19.96. The shipping cost was more than Express service. I will re think this postage the next time I need to get more Frontline Plus from this seller. Disappointed with shipping!"

50117,0,"I was hoping that this extreme kong toy would offer some lasting entertainment to our two dogs. Unfortunately, this toy lasted only 3-4 hours after our dogs began chewing on it. We have a bassett hound and a bernese/rott mix, both of which should be product testers in our family's opinion. I do have another extreme kong toy which has lasted for a lengthy amount of time; and, was hoping to find at least one more of a different type for both dogs to share. The bassett hound had chewed the end of this toy off in just a few hours, so off to the trash it went; and, on goes the search for another suitable toy. Keep trying Kong, you're getting there with the ""extreme"" line; but, still have a bit further to go."
84674,0,"The very confusing and overly complicated instructions do a disservice to a very nice product. It does what it sets out to do, releases whatever amount of dry food that you have selected at exactly the time that has been programmed.. Programming this feeder is frustrating and much more difficult than necessary,Oftentimes the buttons pushed did not work immediately, and there does not seem to be a way to change the times without going through this whole process again. I have questions which I hope customer service can answer. But once I programmed the three serving times, it did work very well..I would have liked a heavier, better made food container. It is very easy for a smart pet to dislodge or tip it over if the feeder is only partially filled.I do recommend this product and would have given it more stars if the instructioms weren't so complicated."

So, when the time came was for her next pill, I gave her one pill pocket with the pill and a regular treat inside. She ate it,no problem.Now, I temporary had to give her meds everyday and she is catching on. She eats the treat and spits out the pill!! I do not know what I am going to do. I guess I will have to force it on her by syringe. Maybe she will go back to taking the pill pocket..."

I had to BEG her to play with it, which she obliged a few times then went on to bigger and better things, like the extension cord. My cat is very active, very playful, and not a couch potato. The cardboard stuff in the middle----she just sits on it, she is not compelled to scratch on it at all. She much prefers my couch, much to my disappointment, I was hoping to distract her with this contraption. The construction of this product is not great, but it's a cat toy, and it's $12 so not very high expectations anyway. It will certainly suffice, but sadly, my cat is not going for it."

32913,0,"I resisted buying a Drinkwell fountain because my cat seemed just fine with drinking water out of a bowl. However, 2 $400 urinary tract-related vet visits later, I figured that if spending $50 on a fountain could save me another expensive visit, then it was worth the expense.I doubted that my cat would drink more water with the Drinkwell, but he actually does! He makes larger liquid waste clumps in his litter box now. Amazing. I surprised because he doesn't seem to care for the ""falling water"" part of the fountain and usually just drinks out of the bowl part.A couple of notes:-This thing is really crappy to clean. It comes apart into 5 pieces to help facilitate the cleaning, but there are still a million crevices that will require several different cleaning devices and a lot of patience to really get clean. I eventually had to take a toothbrush to mine. I was surprised at how much sludge and gunk could accumulate! I haven't yet invested in the Drinkwell cleaning brushes, so maybe they'll make a difference. Drinkwell recommends that you go through this semi-rigorous cleaning ritual every 2 weeks.-I haven't had a problem with noise. Aside from the expected trickling water sound, it's pretty quiet. It does make some noise when the water level gets low, but it is easily remedied by refilling the thing with some water. It buzzed in a pretty annoying way after I put it back together after the first cleaning, but I hadn't gotten in the motor back in just right. I shifted the motor a little, and the sound went away.-The filter it comes with is pretty much useless. It looks and feels a lot like a white version of one of those green scrubber pads. Also, it appeared to be releasing all kinds of particulate matter from itself into the water, so I ditched the thing pretty early on. In any case, larger particles seem to get caught up in the water intake valve in the bowl part of the fountain and I doubted that the scrubber pad thing was doing much for the elimination of microscopic particles. The best way to keep the water fresh is the change it out and scrub the fountain clean.-I'm not sure that the water stays ""fresher"" in the fountain. Because it's much easier to change and clean a bowl of water, I tended to do it every day. The Drinkwell, being as hard to clean as it is, has me cleaning it every 2 weeks. Even if the water is moving, it's still subject to the sludge that builds up in the fountain on a regular basis."
125945,0,It works and I will keep it. The board is very light so if your CAT weights a lot like mine you may need a stronger one and not this one. My cat is about 15 pounds and this is really pushing it so they should have a weight limit on the advertizing. Over all.....happy!
164721,2,This pump was a disapointment! It seemed to not have much power to begin with and after using it for 1 1/2 months it just quit working and left me SOL in hot weather. Had to run to Lowes and purchase a pump so my fish could continue to live.Thanks
94612,0,"This is my second brush in two years... each time, after 12 months of frequent use (I have two large black labs) the handle just snaps off at the narrowest point under the diagonal rubber thumb rest and no I do not believe I am pressing too hard, I believe the material must get brittle with age/use/temperatures or something.Removes hair very well... better than any other brush I have tried... and I have tried many, but kinda tiresome to have to buy a new one every 12 months.Update 1/18/2010...

It's a great toy for an active dog."
22966,0,The FURminator worked ok. I had bought a wire brush at my local gorcery store for about $2 and found it worked just as well. I wouldn't rush out and buy this product. Of course my cats get brushed daily so maybe that's why I wasn't so impressed.
583,2,"I bought one of these and it leaked like a sieve. After reading positive reviews, I concluded that I had one that was faulty and bought a second. Nope, it performs the same way. If filled to water line, you can rotate it FORWARD and it can lie flat with the bowl part down and it won't leak during this process. However, if you rotate it BACKWARD into use position, water flows into the bowl; and if you rotate it further than flat, or end over end in either direction, water goes everywhere. I cannot guarantee that this item, flung in my trunk or the back of the car, would be thoughtful enough to only fall forward, and to go no further than perfectly flat. Filling it only to water line means the capacity is much smaller than you would think from looking at the volume of the bottle. Despite the many positive reviews, I simply don't understand the point of this product. A screw-on cap on top of the water bowl would make it leakproof, and increase its carrying capacity. For that matter, I could just carry a bottle that screws shut and a water bowl . . ."
21584,0,"This litterbox system does work pretty well, but it has two major drawbacks:1) Even though the company claims that a refill lasts one month with one cat, in reality I have to replace it once a week. This makes it the most expensive litter box I ever had. It still saves some time since I don't have to do anything with this box for a whole week.2) The box itself is a bit small so the cat's rear is always pretty close to one end or the other. I.e., the plastic rim gets a fair share of ""splatter"" which I have to wipe off every time I replace the cartridge.My cat is a very old cat. The regular lumping litter gets stuck in her paws and she no longer is able to get it out. The litter that is used with these cartridges does not stick to her paws so she is a lot happier. That's the reason I am using this system. Otherwise I would use plain, lumping litter."
8616,1,I bought this product about a month ago so far no hummingbirds. Maybe the hummingbirds need to be aware that I put this in my backyard; just a note the food needs to be changed weekly which I haven't done yet. The product is glass with nice flowers on it but the bottom portion is plastic.
39444,2,"After looking for the next greatest cat litter pan invention, I came across this. I read the reviews which were by and large really positive about the product. So I thought maybe it really was that simple to come up with a $50 product that does what you want vs. a $150 motorized litter pan which have their own issues. Unfortunately it simply is not what many of the reviews here indicate it is. I'm not an engineer but I can assure you my pan is properly assembled. Sure it's easy enough to roll on the side to sift out the litter but guess what...IT LEAKS! So every time I roll it, I then have to dig out the broom to sweep up the litter it spills all over my floor. And don't fool yourself in thinking that this pan will forever remove your requirement to scoop litter again because it won't. For clumps that are stubbornly stuck to the sides/bottom of the pan or too firm to sift, guess who's going to be removing the lid and scooping them out? Unless you've taught your cat some amazing tricks, it's going to be you! So after trying this pan and the $150 motorized pan which lasted a whopping 3 months before the motor burned out, I'm going back to the $15 deep sided plain old Rubbermaid pan. And I'll keep dreaming for the day that someone invents the ideal cat litter/auto scooping pan...or that my cats stop laughing at me long enough for me to teach them how to scoop and clean up after themselves."
164799,2,"I measured my dog's collar before purchase and found it to be 20"" long, as worn. Based on this, I purchased the Extra Large size, described as fitting 14 to 21"" necks. When I received the collar, the largest it would extend to is 19"". It turns out my 20"" was conservative, and it barely fit my dog's neck. Beware if your measurement doesn't have the (thick fur) give that mine had.I purchased the collar to prevent my dog from licking her front paws. It was not actually long enough to prevent this, although it did slow her down a bit (she is a labrador retriever). The length should work to prevent licking/biting for most other areas, or for dogs which have shorter neck/head/snout.As with all dogs in Elizabethan collars, mine was running into all sorts of things (like my shins) and on day two, she broke the collar running into a doorway. Running into things with the wider than normal collar should be taken into account in the design. This one just isn't up to use by a 70 lb active dog.To give the collar some credit, the velcro closures worked well. They are fast to open and close and hold well."

102610,1,"I talked to the vet who makes the pricey Mondo scratching post made of sisal fabric and learned that a cat's nail is an extension of it's bone. The sisal rope scratching posts can be jarring to the bones/joints of a cat because as they claw down the post it has a washboard tha tha tha effect. So I decided to try a sisal fabric post that is much less expensive than the Mondo, and hoped my cat would love it and not be too attached to his old carpet one that is falling apart. I sprayed it with catnip and he took to it right away. He's a big 13# long legged guy, and he loves how he can stretch up higher.I did notice that the sisal fabric pulled away from the start only at the places where my cat dug in and pulled. So it looks wavy. Perhaps this is because I washed it with a brush and soapy water first to hopefully remove the formaldehyde that is on most sisal. I'm not sure. Regardless, it seems like it will last a long while."

196573,0,"Let me start by saying that the breakage was fixable...I did not contact the company to get a replacement, but I'm sure they would have sent me one had I asked. Installed fairly easily. About week 3, the screws holding the outer aluminum frame to the plastic tunnel frame broke through the plastic, and the outer door fell off. I purchased the large door for my dog who weighs about 48# and is fairly low to the ground (Bassett cross), so there weren't any problems with the size of the door. Also, she doesn't barrel through it like a freight train. It was just poor construction, plain and simple. The holes should have been reinforced or bolts should have been placed with washers and nuts to prevent that kind of stripping. Which is what I did to fix it, and now it's fine...it is pretty weather proof. Serves our purpose, which is to let the dog in the back porch to get out of rain, heat, snow, etc."
69117,0,"Too big for 2005 Honda CRV LX.I bought the hammock thinking I could use it as the hammock, back seat cover, and trunk cover.2 out of 3 of the options are workable with my SUV.The straps are too long even at its tightest. The hammock is too long and has to be tucked at the sides of the front seats getting in the way of the front seats' seat belts. NOT good for cars with a 3-seater backseat, especially if the middle seat's seat belt is attached at both ends. I am going to end up using this as a blanket for the back seat when no one else is back there (no one needs to the seat belts), and drop the front seat loops on the floor or the trunk.BUT, the material is very sturdy and i LOVE the fact that it is machine washable."

169743,1,My vet recommended this product in Europe b.c my dog has problems with her back legs. I have been ordering this product for over a year and would not change anything about it. This product has saved me alot of money that I would otherwise be spending on surgery if not using Arthroflex as a preventative. Thanks
61364,2,"I recently purchased this product from Petco to replace an earlier model that I had for four years that finally died on me. I loved the earlier model.As soon as I opened this new model, I could tell that the entire thing was much more flimsy than my previous one. The plastic is thinner throughout, and the top part (the part with the motor and rake) does not latch onto the bottom basin that holds the litter as the old model did.This model does come with a built in ""ionic air cleaner"" that does little more than turn on a green light every time one of my cats uses it and makes a sound like static, which makes me worry that it will electricute them if their fur ever gets caught in it.As with other reviews, I, too, have noticed an increase in the amount of litter that my cats kick onto the floor around the box, but I also notice that underneath the box (under where the waste box connects to the litter box) there is always a pile of cat litter.Besides that, when I dump the clumps out of the waste box (I reuse the waste boxes a couple times because of the cost of the boxes), I notice that there is a lot of unclumped litter that is being raked into my waste box, essentially being wasted by this model.I never had any of these problems with the previous models, and I would have purchased the older model when my old one died, except that my local Petco only carries this model.I paid a lot of money for this litter box, and I feel like I am being repaid by Littermaid with a lower quality product that wastes my money by making me buy litter more often and wastes my time by making me clean up the mess that is made by the product that is supposed to do it for me."

I believe I am told that so they won't miss out on making more money off of me. I will always buy it from Amazon because the price is better than anyone else around. I am the kind of person that believes my dog and cat are like my children, I would not give them anything I thought would harm them just to save a buck."

It is really easy to refill the water reservoir (and not make a mess) and we have had no problems with it (we have had it a couple of months now). It stays pretty clean, and we use drinking water from the tap and is pretty quiet. We can hear when the cats are drinking from it when we are in another room due to them interrupting the constant water fall, but it doesn't bother us at all. Our cats love not only drinking the water, but they love watching the water, so, this is a source of entertainment for our indoor kitties. One of our cats refused to drink out of a regular dish and insisted on drinking running water from the sink. The water noise from the Drinkwell water fountain stimulates the cats to drink more frequently. We have been able to stop the in-sink drinking and now the cat only drinks from the Drinkwell. I love that I don't have to worry about whether or not the cats are staying hydrated (because dehydration can be a cause of urinary tract infections, especially in male cats) because they are always drinking from this water fountain. We would recommend this water fountain to anyone with indoor pets!"

I came home to discover she had knocked it around quite a bit so that the top part had come off, the food was eaten and the plastic cover over the control panel had been chewed. Perhaps the two stars should be assigned to my food crazed pet, but she's not exactly a junk yard dog.Programming the device was also very challenging and I'm almost always fine with that sort of thing. The instructions were poorly written and the steps counter-intuitive.The feeder did seem to work just fine when I did a trial run at dinner the night before leaving it alone with the dog while I was at work. As I said, this might work very well for cats. It simply isn't sturdy enough for many dogs, even of the smallish variety."

175026,1,The critters love it and will sit through the brushing and beg for more. I got this one for Mom for her cat.
122737,0,"This is extremely well made and reasonable attractive, and it installs easily. Two things keep me from giving it a better rating. First, it's smaller than the description suggests - not in terms of dimensions but on the sizes of cats that can use it. Our 11-lb cat rubs all 4 sides going through it, and the 12-lb one won't at all - and neither is considered a &#34;large&#34; cat. I suggest the larger size for anything bigger than a kitten. Second, although well made, the door could benefit from two enhancements. First, the door should be removable so animals can get used to going through the narrow opening. It's a lot narrower than the rough opening cut into the door. The door can't be propped open since the swing is limited to 90 degrees from its closed position. Second, it would really help if the magnet could be removed. We found the cats pushed against the door but wouldn't usually push hard enough to overcome the magnet, which causes the door to &#34;snap&#34; shut, however gently. It was enough to make the cats skittish. I tired to remove both the magnet and the door, but this is where I discovered how well made the product really is - neither can be removed without breaking the door, which I eventually did. So overall, good product for small, brave felines - not so perfect for others."

One of them likes it for a few minutes then I must stop, while the other one won't have anything to do with it. I also kept hearing some of the hair ""rip"" out instead of ""comb"" out, so maybe that is why the cat doesn't like it. It doesn't stop the shedding but it does clean them up a little bit.So I would say it is good, not perfect, but what is...Would I buy it again, maybe...but I haven't found a comb that they truly like and gets a lot of hair trimmed; therefore I gave it 3 stars."
203533,1,"I have a long haired dog that would always shed and get matted in the winter. No matter how much I washed him or brushed him with a normal dog brush nothing would help. The day I got this brush in, I spent about 30 minutes brushing him and I got out enough hair to fill 5 of the plastic grocery bags! Over the next few days I got more and more out. I still use it on him daily and the amount of hair coming out is lessening and his coat is so shiny and healthy look that I have got many compliments-even from the vet.This is one brush you will not regret spending the extra money on!"

56928,2,"I purchased 3 packs of 6 doses to guarantee that my four cats would be flea-free throughout the summer. However, the cats were scratching obsessively with hidden fleas darting in and out of their fur. I spoke with three different veterinarians who independently confirmed my suspicions - because frontline has not varied its formula the fleas have developed a resistance to this drug. I noticed that Frontline has a ""satisfaction guaranteed"" label, so I decided to inquire, but I must unequivocally state that they work hard to guarantee dissatisfaction. After two lengthy conversations with frontline personnel stating that they have not had ""any"" complaints they finally stated that their drug is guaranteed to get rid of the eggs, but not the fleas. They would not give reimbursement unless you had given your cat at least three monthly doses and your receipt had to demonstrate that you purchased that amount and the purchase date occurred at least three months before the date of this phone inquiry. Luckily, I had my ducks in a row and submitted an invoice with all the information they requested - only to be called and told that they will not provide any reimbursement if you purchased frontline from AMAZON.com since its a warehouse (?????) You can't win - the telephone operator's job is to ensure that your dissatisfaction is guaranteed. The vets did recommend Vectra, which is the company that last altered its formula - it has worked wonders and my cats can now sleep in peace."
197212,0,"We've had this fountain for over a year and it's working great for the cat. It's part of the solution for her kidney weakness, and her numbers have gotten better.However, there are a few problems. I have to clean it thoroughly every two weeks because it gets slimy. We have hard water and also the pump efficiency degrades. I've not gotten the handle of doing a full disassembly every 2-3 weeks, but it does take 20 minutes to get all the nooks and crannies.My latest complaint is now the unit has stopped refilling itself. I can't figure out why, it just doesn't drain from the dome. If I lift one edge, I can get a few glugs of water to come out, but not enough. Instead I just add a cup of water every day. If I don't add, the motor starts trying to draw air and is very noisy. Anyone have a fix for this?This is the only automatic dish I've used so I can't give it too poor of a rating.PS, the motor has completely jammed a few times, but a thorough cleaning has always revived it. I have to blame that on our hard water."
33162,1,My Greater Swiss Mountain Dog didn't know what to do with this bone at first b/c it was so massive. I ordered 3 of them and cannot believe the size. Well worth the money. Buy more so shipping is less! Will definitely purchase these again.

The fountain noise is louder than the Petmate, but it's a fountain noise not a motor noise. Bought the add on tank. No ""dry sucking noise"". I should have bought this one a long time ago instead of dealing with the constant problems with the Petmate. Again, none of that annoying ""dry sucking noise"". Also, per the directions, you don't have to use the filters if you are using filtered water at home."
123098,0,"The reason I bought this was to remove pet hair from carpet. All it does is make clumps which I admit is easier to vacuum but I still have to break out the vacuum. I was hoping to get the bulk of the hair with this but it's not happening. I have a Great Pyrenees so there is hair everywhere. On wood floors this works great, grabs all the hair just not on carpet. Broom is well made."

136452,0,"I've had the Litter Robot LRII for about 2 weeks now and while I am happy enough with my purchase that I will not take advantage of the generous return policy, I do feel that there are some elements of its design that need to be greatly improved upon when they eventually release an LRIII.First, as many others have mentioned, the grate system of the step that is designed to allow litter to fall into the waste area really defeats much of the purpose of having a hidden waste area. The same openings that do allow some litter to fall into the waste chamber as opposed to covering your floor allow more odor to escape than I would like. This is rather easily fixable, but when you're paying $300 for a litter box you shouldn't have to DIY something this basic.Second, while the LRII is very good about pausing its cycle when a cat steps up onto it, something to prevent cats from being to enter it at all while cycling would be sorely appreciated. And this, unfortunately, cannot be fixed by the home user. I'd noticed that over the past few days the odor from the LRII was a bit stronger than it had been, despite having recently put in a new scented trash bag and a liberal dosage of litter deodorizer. Last night I came across one of my (2) cats exiting the LRII while the main chamber was upside down, not quite halfway through the cycle. He knew that was where he was supposed to go, appeared rather frustrated that there was no litter in there with which to bury his waste, but went ahead and relieved himself on the bare plastic. It took 2 manual cycles to get his waste off the side of the chamber and into the waste area below, and the smell since then has been rather powerful. So tonight I'll be washing it out after 2 weeks of ownership, even though washng is supposed to be necessary on more of a monthly basis.I realize that having some sort of a sliding panel that closes the main chamber off when cycling allows for the possibility of trapping a cat inside during the cycle, but there must be some way to include a sensor within the chamber itself to avoid this - as opposed to simply relying on the sensor in the step mechanism.As it stands, I do recommend the LRII to anyone who wants to reduce the typical litter box odor in their home and wants to escape cleaning the litter box 1-2x a day in favor of simply swapping out a trash bag 1-2x a week. I would recommend it without reservation though if they were to address my 2 main issues in the next iteration. The LRII is close to being exactly what I wanted when I ordered it, and with a little work it definitely could be."

88052,2,"after about a year of use, this thing falls apart!!! On top of that, it's a pain in the neck to clean. it doesn't come apart so that you can clean the area where the motor is - which just happens to be where the most debris collects! We bought this just about a year ago now and the thing just started to die. The water doesn't flow out like it should. I called customer service and they suggested ordering another replacement and sending this one in for repair - at my expense no less. Save your money - there are other fountains out there that work just as well if not better than this crappy thing!"
129960,1,"While I was visiting Puerto Rico in October 1997 I fell in love with a kitten that had been abandoned. When I called the airlines to see if it would be possible to carry my new kitten on the plane WITH ME (she was too small, only 4 weeks old to go in cargo) they recommended that I buy a carrier that could fit under the airplane seat. I had not heard of anything like this, but I went to the closest pet store and asked them if they had one. THEY DID - this very one for less than $20. I bought it and brought her back home with me.Not only was the carrier a perfect fit under the seat it was a perfect size to sit on top of the seat tray so I could check on her (feed her/comfort her). PLUS I loved that you couldn't really see inside and poke around because it kept her more calm. I have had this carrier since! Nothing has broken! Anytime I had to carry her anywhere (moving, vets, pet-sitters) I used it. In her adult - senior age she was used to it, and although it didn't give her a lot of wiggle room this was by far the best way to transport her. I once used a ""new"" carrier thinking the extra wiggle room would be appreciated but half way through the drive she peed. Sometimes less is best.Today I am buying another one so the new kitten doesn't have to share but I still have the 1st one and I will never get rid of it."
23929,0,"This product is ok, when cleaning a turtle tank you have to pay special attention to all of the nook and cranies that the lower half of the intact holes are. Otherwise the turtles waste builds up and creates a place for horrible smells. The filters are in an easy location to pull out quickly. The pump is easy to clean and take apart.There are clearly marked water level lines on the back side of the filter which is a big help, this product is not ideal if you are looking into that a lot of water depth in your tank. I would recommend for other reptiles other than aquatic turtles like red-ear sliders."
110051,0,"I moved into a new apartment where the bedroom carpet had a number of pet stains that had not been removed before my tenancy. This product helped diminish those stains, but in no way fully removed them. I applied the spray twice, waited first 5 minutes, then 15 minutes, respectively, and then I used elbow grease and scrubbed. Maybe my stains were too tough, but I was a bit disappointed.As far as smell goes, I can't comment. I had already removed the pet odor with a pet odor removal powder sold by Glade."
119177,1,"I bought this for my sugar gliders. While I was waiting for my gliders to be weaned, I also let my ferret try it out. Both the ferret and the sugar gliders seem to like the cage. It provides ample space for them to move around and play. The ledges and ramps provided really allow the animals to utilize all of the space. Of course, I don't have all the ledges in place now because my gliders would rather climb around the outer bars of the cage and jump from place to place. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the back part of the cage had thin metal tabs which connected the two sections. These tabs broke before I could get the cage stable. I ended up using plastic zip ties to make it secure. Overall, it is a decent cage for the price."
53541,2,"I don't know what Tidy Cats has done to their formula but it was not a wise move. As stated by an earlier reviewer, the old formula would turn into nice balls and was a finer grain. My cats loved the stuff as did I. The new formulation makes giant clumps that now stick to the floor of the litter box and are almost impossible to properly clean out. You have to scrape, scrape, and scrape some more just to get the muddy residue off the bottom of the box and then you've got all these fine scrapings of urine that won't/can't be picked up by the scooper within the leftover litter.It used to be the blue and red caps were different but now they are pretty much the same. Tidy Cats has turned into Scoop Away.Now the new search begins. Purina...take the hint. Bring back the old formula."
185082,0,"I find it hard to review things that animals use exclusively. I mean I can review a cat toy based on how much they like to play with it. But a bed warmer? I don't know. This one doesn't seem to do much. I haven't curled up on it and tried to enjoy it though. We have it in an outside cat house that sits on a covered porch. This thing doesn't seem very warm when I touch it, but maybe it warms up when they are on it. They are forced to lay on it though since it covers about half of their house. So I guess it's ok?"

We used Frontline for years with no problems, but the vet said they can get immune so we switched to this. I am hoping after 3 months of using K9 it will kick in and start controlling the ticks. I bought 6 months worth and if the tick problem still occurs we will go back to Frontline."

142466,0,"I bought my first littermaid 6 years ago and it worked brilliantly until a month or so ago when the engine conked out. The new LM500 I just bought is definitely a downgrade in terms of quality, but a few adjustments make it workable. Definitely spray some non-stick oil on the rakes so that the debris does not stick to it. And a huge Thank You to the reviewer for the suggestion about the cupboard protectors. The non-stop raking problem hit me, but I bought some cupboard protectors (a package of 8 for $1.29 at my local hardware store) and stuck 1 on the toggle switch (just above the rake's starting position on the track on the left) and it is now fixed. I did have to play with the exact position; the first attempt made it stop 1/2 way through and the 2nd made it not rake at all. But the 3rd time, I found the sweet spot and now it rakes once and finishes."
17808,2,"All I can say is I'm so glad I didnt pay full price for this product. It stopped working after using one time. I tried changing the battery and unfilling and then refilling the cartridge and nothing! When it did work I was not impressed either. I noticed the response was erratic at best and didn't spray everytime my dog barked, which only confused her more. I was very hopeful this would be the humane answer to end the barking issues we have with our dog. I refuse to use a shock collar as I feel that is pretty close to torture. (She is a 20 pound German Spitz by the way) So she is really heavily coated, so I did trim the hair around her neck hoping that would help and even put a bandana around her neck as well and then put the collar on and still got very little response from the spray collar despite repeated barking. Save your money and buy a squirt bottle and fill with water and spray your dog yourself when they bark, it's a cheaper alternative! Hope that helps and thanks for reading!"

45494,1,"While using this, my 5 month German Shepherd stops pulling on the leash. The only problem is that she knows when she's wearing this and will still sometimes pull when she's not wearing it.

164655,0,"This door comes with very poor instructions, it took my husband and I 2 days to install it. You have to tape the frame to the door and trace around to see where to cut. Taping it level is a trick. I advise taking the door off the hinges to do this. Then we cut it out, and it was too small for the framing, so we needed to cut it bigger. Then once we finally got it in, the door would get stuck, we had to redo the screw holes. It was a mess. Then the inner wall frame that came with it, wouldn't stay, so I hot glued it to the door.Also it only comes with one small wheather strip gasket, and is drafty, so we rolled up small strips of cloth and put in the gaps, as well as using cilicone to seal it up. It only has the one hard plastic flap, so if you are in a cold climate, as I am, either pay more for two flaps, or put a towel or rug up on the inside as a second flap to help keep the cold out."

90663,0,"This has been my collie's outdoor bed for at least the past three years. My dog loves it, and overall it's held up pretty well. In the long run, you can expect to at least replace the whole cover, if not the entire bed (for reasons explained below)Pros:- Though my dog was skeptical at first, she LOVES this bed. It's her outdoor throne. She loves to lie on this and keep watch over the neighborhood- it's a great bed in the winter, since the snow can't damage itCons:-the feet can scratch wood decks. We eventually taped some cardboard over them which solved the problem, but I'll be looking for rubber feet for the next one- the cover does eventually develop holes. My dog doesn't scratch at it (like other reviewers). I think the holes are just everyday wear and tear from her getting on and off the bed.- the screws rusted into their fittings and are now impossible to remove -- so instead of being able to use a replacement cover, I'll be buying a whole new bed. I'm VERY disappointed by this (especially since I already ordered a new cover). The rust was not at all apparent from the outside. I got one screw lose and pulled part of the frame apart. Lots of rusty powder fell out of the frame, even though her bed has never had direct exposure to precipitation. The other screws won't come out no matter how much WD-40 or force we use. As other reviewers suggested, I'll be getting stainless steel screws for the next one.- it does sag more over time, but my dog doesn't seem to mind. It still keeps her off the ground."

136690,0,"I have multiple health problems, so I ordered the new bubble 2 litter robot, to help with a chore that is becoming increasingly difficult for me. I anxiously awaited for it to come, and I was so disappointed when it did not work right out of the box. It would not turn and the red error light stayed on. Also, I did not receive the 3 litter bags or the charcoal filter that was supposed to come with it. I called the company and they promised they would send me a new base for the globe. It came a few days later as promised, but I was very disappointed again. Upon inspection, it was obvious I had been sent a used unit. Bits of litter still clung to the drawer, and the underside of the drawer clearly had multiple dirty scratch marks ingrained into it from obviously being pulled in and out during use.I paid the $60 difference for a new unit, but ended up with a used, reconditioned one anyway. So for all of you considering a reconditioned versus new, you might as well save $60 and get the used one, since that is what you end up with anyway if you have a problem with it.On the plus side, although I have only been using it for about a week, it does seem to work fairly well now. But I would be amiss not to warn you that I have seen an occasional clump of litter that did not go out and into the drawer as advertised upon completion of the cycle. So it occasionally takes more than one cycle of cat use for it to get dumped out.I only have one petite 9 lb. cat using it at the present time. I also have a very large - 22+lb. cat who stands on the step and stares into it longingly, but is too big to get into it, seeming rather unfair that he still has to go to the basement to his old box, and I still have to clean it.I wish these geniuses would redesign it so it is large enough inside to accomodate all cats, not just the smaller ones. Many people have cats over 16 lbs. and up such as in my mixed household. It wouldn't hurt to make it somewhat larger anyway, since the space inside seems to limit my small cat even. Thank goodness he turns around, with his head poking out, or he would be doing his business out the door and down the front, probably wrecking the electronic mechanism located there that runs the whole shebang.By the way, it does come with a plastic around the electronic front, and a label asking you to leave it there until you're sure it works, thereby acknowledging the fact that if your cat happens to use it by going in head first, it will likely run down and ruin your $360 purchase. Needless to say, my plastic will stay on indefinitely. The idea of the litter-robot is probably one of the best out there right now, but whoever designed it, should spend some additional time correcting these problems of interior size and location of the electronics. Just my opinion for a very pricey item that should already have been perfected."
30250,0,"My dogs love this bed and I would too if it were easier to wash. I have successfully taken it to the laundromat and it comes out beautifully but as most of us who own big dogs wish for, a cover that we could unzip and throw in the washer at home would be less of a hassle. Needless to say, it gets a little gritty between washes and the inner edge of the bed can get downright nasty if you don't vacuum it regularly but it is a decent buy."

A call placed to them was returned and the company owner called for lab results for me. So I recommend this product with this caveat - do not expect a result within 24 hours of them receiving the specimen. If that is not a concern to you...then I think you can go with this product.
13517,2,"I got these because of the good reviews and even bought the 150-pak right away. They're not as absorbent as I would have thought. My breeder actually gave me a couple of pads when I picked up my Yorkshire Terrier and I used those first because I figured it would remind my new baby of his old home. They were fine! My Yorkie is so small, just 2.5 lbs so when he goes pee, it's not THAT much pee. I leave the pee pad there after he uses it since I'm trying to housebreak him so he would come back there. The first weekend we switched the pads every other day and only because our Yorkie liked to rest on the pad so we didnt want it to be TOO dirty.After I ran out, I started using these wee-wee pads and once he pees, I can see the blue underneath already! It's not leaking through but if I can already see the blue I feel like it's not that absorbent at ALL! I had to switch it everyday. When I pick it up, I need to wipe the floor underneath it just in case (because the outside of the pad feels damp). I don't actually end up wiping anything but the damp feeling makes me feel ehhh about it all.I have 145 more of these pads to go through. I guess it's a good thing I need to make sure it's changed everyday then because then I can go through it faster..."

140475,2,"Sorry Hartz, but I think you missed the boat on this Guinea Pig Food. Mine knocked most of it out of her food bowl, and I ended up throwing it away. She always pushes the food aside that she does not like, and only eats what she does like. So, I would say that 3/4 of this food went to the trash, which means this is a waste of money for our Guinea Pig. While she eats the compressed alfalfa pieces, that is about the only thing she liked in the mix. The bag only lasted us two weeks, because I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. A typical bag of Guinea Pig food, in this same volume weight, lasts us about six weeks. You do the math. I generously gave you 2 stars for the alfalfa. But, I certainly find NOTHING 'gourmet' about this food."

Since this is supposed to simulate discipline by mother dogs, it should stay on top of her neck, in my opinion. Consequently, her pulling is somewhat lessened, but not completely."
119478,0,"I read the previous review on here where one of the people had purchased this crinkle tunnel for their guinea pigs and theirs loved the sound... So, I purchased it for mine. We have worked to try to get ours used to the sound but it threatens them for some reason, and they will not use it at all. In fact, they run and hide from it. I am sure this is a fun tunnel for some animals, but I wanted to make sure and let other's know that if their piggies, or possibly other animals, are not used to crinkle noises, they may not want to purchase this specific tunnel for theirs. I suggest getting something that makes a stiff crinkling noise, like some stiff cellophane or something like that, since that's kind of how this one sounds... Try it around your guinea pigs and see if they like the sound, before purchasing this one. Like I said, I am not reviewing the durability or quality of the product as I do not have an opinion in that regard since our animals won't get near it. Simply that it was previously stated in another review that someone's guinea pigs loved it, and mine definitely do not."
154203,0,"Got the box of spray millet quickly, however, they stalks were very small and dark in color, indicating they were not as fresh as previously. Maybe the time of year??? My birds were not as eager to eat it as before!! Hope this is only a temporary thing!!"

It would be nice if the glass bottle could be seperated from the mounting cups. As it is, you have to pry the whole feeder off the glass and then reapply the whole thing. I was able to slide off the feeder on my other one.."

128618,0,"We just got this toy in the mail today and were really excited about it, since the reviews made it sound pretty durable. Unfortunately we have a 4.5 month old chewer on our hands (Elkhound/Pyrenees mix) and after playing with the squeaky squirrels for a bit, he started to focus on the trunk. He managed to destroy that trunk in about 2 hours. I really hope the stuffing isn't dangerous for him since within the first hour he managed to rip a hole in the inside lining so we had to take it away and destuff the rest ourselves. The stuffing feels kind of like fiberglass but I would hope that's not what it actually is... In the next hour he managed to tear open the bottom of the trunk and remove cardboard, which we also confiscated right away.Anyway he really enjoys it, right now he's just gnawing on (what's left of) the tree trunk. We'll give him the squeaky squirrels back one by one so he doesn't destroy them all in one sitting!All in all this is a fun toy but probably not worth the money for chewers!"
10277,0,"This product did an o.k. job but not outstanding, it is such a very fine type of granule that it comes through just about every pouch sock made for filters that it was all over everything.The water never cleared up like i thought it should.oh well i learned to double pouch and buy larger amounts might make it work better."

173047,0,This is a standard Premier leash with about 12 - 18 inches of glow in the dark/reflective tape sown on one side of the leash. I would have preferred the tape to be on both sides to increase visibility from more angles. We use this leash at night and our regular leash during the day. I'm not sure how long the reflective tape will last. Being placed close to the clasp means it is closer to the dog's head and less likely to be bent and broken off. The glow fades rather quickly once it has been charged by light.PROS:- reflective tape reflects well- placed near dog's headCONS:- tape only on one side of the leash- tape only 12 - 18 inches long- tape not long enough to show where the human is- glow fades quicklyIf it is on sale and you want a little more visibility at night then this leash may do the trick. I think a reflective collar may be a better idea as it would work from more angles.
132169,1,"Good quality. It is very important for me that it's waterproof. My dog goes on trail every day and swims in the stream there, and digs in the sand, so the collar gets really dirty and wet, and still functions just fine. Have no problems whatsoever so far."
57149,2,"After reading the other reviews, I still decided to purchase, hoping that I would have better luck. My cat weighs 8 pounds and has medium length fur. Used Advantage for the first 4 years of her life, but it had stopped working. Used Frontline once previously a few years prior and it didn't work, so switched back to advantage. But now advantage wasn't working either so we needed to try a new kind. Frontline Plus was a waste of money. It has killed none of her fleas--I applied the first dose a week and a half ago, and applied a second does (after researching online whether it would be okay) at the one week mark. There has been no change. I'm glad I only bought the 3 month supply instead of wasting more money. I should have listened to my intuition, but I didn't and it was a waste of money. Our vet just got Vectra and my mom said it has been amazing on their two cats, so I'm going to try that next. Frontline Plus is definitely not worth it."
72130,0,"The vet recommended using the Feliway pheromone product as a way to calm two spatting cats. The 6-pack price is terrific! Does it work? Hmmm, you have to believe in something, and they are a little less antagonistic to each other these days."
186019,0,"I was intent on purchasing this product because I have a few cats that seem bored and I was eager to give them something to generate interest. Before I purchased this product, I read some reviews that mentioned there was a nail sticking out inside the box. When I got this toy, I looked inside and indeed, there was a 1-inch nail sticking up inside ( but pointy side down). I got a screwdriver and bent it down and it snapped off easily. This did not cause damage to the box and has not weakened it. Except for the nail issue, the box is well made, with a nice finish and is sanded down nicely, especially inside all the holes. My cats were semi-interested in it and I put toys as well as treats inside it. My cats seemed to enjoy getting the treats out more than the toys because the toys, especially the balls, fell out easily. (This product also comes with two, rather nice, colorful balls.) My cats were disinterested after awhile and because I have a multi-cat household, my cats really didn't like having to share. I think this product would work well if there was an electric ball-toy designed to move around inside the box by itself. There are toys like that, but too big for the box. All in all, the box is made well, but in retrospect, I don't think a box with holes is worth $20. Lastly, as with most cat toys, I would suggest supervising your cats while they play with this box. The holes are large enough for the cat to easily extend their arms into the holes but they could get caught if they bend at the elbow."

138471,1,These bowls are simple and elegant. The color is beautiful. No silly dog paws or other juvenile designs. Love them.
92257,1,"One of my cat's favorite toys. He will paw at it, attack it, jump for it, and chase it. Good purchase."
202576,1,This is a great product. I bought this to use on my cat - thins the fur. I also take my German Shepherd to be groomed once a month with one and it has greatly reduced the shedding.
179580,1,"My 15 lb Ragdoll cat found the bed within an hour of putting it out. He's in and out of it throughout the day. To my relief, he seems to have taken to it quite well. We want to start taking him with us on overnight trips and this is a perfect travel bed for him. The small size is still a little large for him, but should be perfect when he reaches his 20 lb projected size. For now, I just fill in the space with a towel rolled lengthwise around the inside perimeter."
59025,0,"The package came on time.The price of the product was very good. However the product inside was marked ""US Vet Use Only"". I have never seen that on a Frontline product before. Maybe this is something new and hopefully this is not a bogus knock-off. We won't know for sure...."
150679,0,Seems like they do what they are suppose to do. Tho hard to tell as my Eheim canister filters pump took a dump within 1 month. So I sent it back !
71648,1,"I have an 8 y/o and a 6y/o Great Dane. Being large as they are, they are prone to hip and joint problems as they age. Both the dogs are in great health but we had begun to notice the older one slowing down, as we all do eventually. I spoke to my sister who has a 9 y/o boxer and she highly recommended NaturVet Glucosamine DS. She has been giving it to her dog and noticed a huge improvement in her mobility. Our vet had recommended that we start giving the dogs glucosamine and so I thought we'd give it a try. From the moment it arrived, the dogs have loved taking it! It must taste really good to them because all I have to do is say ""treats"" and they both know what that means! The younger dog is not so noticable in her mobility as she hadn't really hit that stage yet, but it sure hasn't hurt her either and I give her half the required dosage. The older dog has perked back up and seems to enjoy once again, running around the yard and playing actively with her companion. I am hoping that this product will continue to give her that quality of life she so richly deserves!"
16367,0,"This product seems to only work when it's still wet. After it has dried, it has no effect. I own a pitbull pup and she will avoid it like the plague until it dries, and then it's like it's not even there. Regardless, it's worth the price."
82577,0,"I got this for our husky mix, to house train her. It worked fine until I came back one day to find she had broken out of it. The crate is collapsible and the method of securing the walls when erected is a little weak. All our dog had to do to get out was to pull the wall towards her and the thing popped out.That said, I fixed this with a couple of zip lock straps on each wall."
79995,0,Your rabbit will chew through this harness if you are not very attentive to it.Would be great if it was a bit sturdier.
80019,1,"Used this in a new aquarium. Fish didn't die, so I guess it worked as advertised. I would use it again, but I don't have a lot of experience with keeping fish."
29895,1,"My dog LOVES this toy.. it took him about 3 months to slowly destroy it, but that's a pretty good amount of time for him.. He's a miniature pincher and they are pretty tough on their toys. First he managed to rip the tongue while playing tog-o-war, then the tail, and eventually the legs... At this price and with free shipping from amazon, I couldn't have asked for a better toy. It's totally cute, and so much fun!"
17648,2,"This was the biggest waste of money! I put this on my dog as soon as it came in. The first time she barked I could tell it sprayed because she started to sniff in the air. So I began to test her in the house by knocking on doors and such. She continued the barking so I wanted to make sure the thing was working. Sure enough it wasn't spraying. After replacing the battery, I tried it again and it didn't phase her one bit. The spray is just a fine mist. Even when I tested it like they tell you to do it was so fine that I could hardly smell it. I even adjusted the collar several times to make sure I had it on correctly thinking that would make a difference but it didn't. So if you're looking for something to help control your dog's excessive barking, look somewhere else. This is useless!"
94995,2,This item never would work. I kept shortening the collar thinking it was not tight enough against my dog's neck. She finally managed to break the plastic (read cheap) clasp and chewed up the box.
210068,0,the plastic is fine but the picture is decieving. I put it on a dark wood door and adhesive is big white velcro dots. On a white door it is fine but looks not so good on a brown wood door!
182180,1,I don't know about the people who had trouble fitting their fountains to the mat.... pretty obvious where it goes. It is really cute and leaves room for another food dish if you are using one for dry and need another for wet. It is really easy to to tidy up..
174294,0,"This is OK, but my cat prefers the 2-sided brush I got at Target - black plastic bristles/metal pinhead bristles. She has long hair, and the massage idea doesn't work well for her - messes up her hair. She's also sensitve on her body, so she doesn't like to be massaged with the fairly hard rubbery teeth, and she loves gentle brushing with the black bristles on the sides of her face - she loves it so much that she jumps up into the brushing...The bristles don't feel sticky to me (some reviewer said they attract the hair to it), and I don't find it easier to clean than the first brush I got; nor does it work as well in removing loose hair. Regarding cleaning, I prefer the Safari self-cleaning slicker brush which cleans itself beautifully with the press of a button - all the hair comes off in one neat rectangle; it also removes more loose hair, and I like the color of green Safari brush and the gripper handle. I have to be extra carefulwith that brush thoughbecause the bristles are so thin and stiff that it could easily scratch the cat."
75872,0,"When we first opened the package, our three cats really didn't play with them much. A week later they've all disappeared somewhere. Nobody seemed too excited about them."
154781,0,"I've had this litter box for over a year and it is far from perfect, though better than a regular, non-automatic box. I had Littermaid before this and the Scoop-Free is an improvement. I can't figure out why, with all the brilliant inventions people think up, and with a potential market of millions of cat owners, nobody has come up with a truly outstanding automatic litterbox. The first thing to do if you are considering buying ScoopFree or if you have one already, is to buy the Forever Litter Tray, which will save you tons of money and the customer service is unsurpassed. You can buy it here on amazon. The same man who invented and sells these trays recently began selling (also on amazon) a cheaper version of the expensive and hard-to-find Fresh Step crystal litter.Overall the Scoop Free controls odor quite well. I have found that the rake, over time, has became caked with a brown coating - probably a mixture of rust and feces - and it's hard to clean it since the rake does not detach. Also, with my one, average-sized cat, I find that the litter needs to be changed and the box cleaned about every 3 weeks. I travel out of town fairly frequently and I appreciate that, while I'm gone, the box maintains reasonable cleanliness and I don't have to ask my neighbor to scoop daily. If I did not travel at all, I'd probably just use a regular litter box and scoop manually every day."
105352,2,"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."
169401,2,I bought this because it was recommended for tough chewers but my pitbull destroyed it immediately. If you really have a dog that's a heavy chewer stick with the Kong.
142755,2,"What a mess. Litter just gets everywhere...it gets stuck in the back, up on the sides and falls underneath the entire unit in various places. You need to run it frequently and it doesn't always get all the clumps. The containers for the clumps are flimsy at best.I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to sit by it all the time moving debris away from the back and sides."
96420,0,"Bad at flying (doesn't fly straight) and if you're dog is a gnawer... do NOT leave it alone for a second. This thing was ripped in half within 15 minutes of giving it to him. I was still unpacking the rest of the toys that shipped with it & before i finished... he had sufficiently killed this thing. Also, probly would not stand up to any sort of wind. IT's a cloth-like middle with a woven plastic edge. Doesn't sound very sturdy... and isn't sturdy at all in reality. a waste of a few bucks.maybe more appropriate for a mild-mannered 10 lb toy poodle but certainly not good for any dog with a playful attitude and full grown teeth."
211416,0,"I have a fully grown corgi that have problems getting down these steps. The problem isn't the stairs height, so much as it's width. So unless my dog goes down the steps perfectly down the middle, the stairs tend to lift a bit to whatever side he's more close to which freaks him out."
197934,0,"The ball doesn't roll off course and the dogs don't really play it with it on their own - only if it's thrown. They lose interest quickly. Our dogs are two labs who love balls, so it's suprising that they don't engage as much. However, the ball is very sturdy and it can't be chewed through, so it's durable!"
539,1,My Bulldog loves this toy. I can't find them at the Pet Stores any more. Nylabone chew toys have always been my first choice when I buy dog toys.
117543,2,"This purchase has been a nightmare from the begining! Ordered from Amazon, who ordered from Revival, who ordered from Solvit. # of shipping days changes after you place you order and you can't track package because it's too hard to find the correct person to get a tracking #. I found my 4 # Yorkie paralized the day my basket arrived and he underwent a 2 hour neck surgery a few days later. We will not be able to use our basket now and I'm very unhappy to find that I must return the basket to Solvit who has a 12 % restocking fee. I was never given this information on the site that I ordered from.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FALSE INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!!!!!! I will never order from Amazon again."
32368,0,"I don't think it's too safe to leave plugged in 24/7. Also, my cat is always taking the lid to the filter area off. But, lots of fun playing in the water ."
173251,0,"The box looks good. I have not had the issues that people have mentioned about not being able to get the lid back on easily. For me, it lines up every time without a hitch. However, it is a pain to clean. The bottom is not flat so when you're doing a full litter change it's impossible to just scrape everything out. If the bottom was flat it would be much better."
149326,2,"This product is the most useless thing I have ever purchased...it does not attract fleas at all! I've had it set up in a flea infested area in my home for nearly 24 hours now, and the only flea on there is the one I grabbed off my cat and put on there, to see if a flea would actually stick. The box claims to attract fleas up to 30 ft away and will actually draw them out of carpet and upholstery. Hah! I bought this because i needed a way to get fleas off of a litter of kittens who are too young for chemical flea products. Don't waste your money...I'm returning this product ASAP!"
21435,0,They don't last as long as they say and I only have 1 cat. The product is good just wish it laste longer.
176952,1,"Very easy to assemble if you ignore the instruction booklet. Just insert a into a, b into b, and so forth. The directions try to make things much more complicated than they needed to be.Perfect height for my old kitty to get into the bed, she had no trouble figuring the stairs out and I keep catching her just hanging out on it.I highly recommend these!"
67159,0,"I purchased this item to give our cat sanitary clippings and for the most part, this clipper is very disappointing.If the fur is courser fur than long cat fur, I'm sure it works fine but for long cat fur it could not do a much worse job.Over all, the product itself is an excellent product. I have no complaints about the product itself. It comes with two batteries, blade, brush, blade oil, clipper length guides and a plastic holder to keep things somewhat organized. I say somewhat as there's no place for the plastic length guides.The batteries charge up fast. The blade, even when clogged, doesn't bog down. But when used on fine fur, the razor's not worth a Tinker's Damn as the clipping blade loads up and the cutting action stops as the blade, once again, needs to be cleared.Just saying, buyer, if buying to do fine fur, beware."
83947,0,"I did as other recommended and split up the seeds and dirt, as I read this made a lot of grass. First I split them into fourths and the first batch grew all of three seeds. THREE blades of grass. Well needless to say, that didn't make me nor the kitty happy. So, I grew the rest of the seeds, 3/4 of the package. And thinking I did something incorrectly the first time, I re-read and followed the instructions to a tee, and still received about 10 blades of grass out of all of the rest of those seeds. I will try another brand now. Oh and just FYI, the soil is very organic, and SMELLS very organic! The only place I could store my bag was in the kitchen, but the manure smell is not pleasant in the kitchen!"

The flimsy construction is not very encouraging.

200700,0,"I first saw a product demonstration video at my vet's office. I am tired of picking dog hair off my clothes so I wanted to try this for myself. I found this on the Friday Sale so I ordered one. When it arrived I wanted to use it immediately. If you read the directions, your pet has to be clean and dry so I had to wait for after bath time. Once I did finally use it, it didn't get as much hair off as it did in the video. Maybe I didn't press hard enough?? I didn't want to press too hard or it might cause an irritation. It did get some hair off but I wouldn't say any more than a normal brush would."
12714,0,"This item was fairly easy to assemble. Definitely requires at least two people for assembly or REALLY long arms. We received the item in good condition, except for the wheels were missing (we only got one in the package). We don't really move the cage much so it's not a big deal. The spiral ramp requires pegs to secure it in place, and one of the pegs broke. We made due with a metal screw. It really should have some support underneath, as the plastic is a little flimsy for full-grown rats. Overall, pleased with the product considering its price. Our rats enjoy having more area to climb!"

The coat is well made, nicely designed, quality fabric, everything I would look for in a raincoat, but for some reason, Duke thinks otherwise. For a dog, he has very strong opinions!"

There is also quite a bit of food wasted with the fiesta variety food, as they will pick out their favorite items."
165548,1,Fantastic chew treat! Ever since we brought our little yorkie / bichon puppy he has had these and absolutely loves them! He is only 2 1/2 lbs so they last days! He will chew on them for 20 minutes straight! They really keep him busy. He gets so excited when I open the bag! Buying a second bag!!
133778,0,Hard to judge my dogs opinion of this. He doesn't get any people food except leftover vegies. He always gives me a funny look when he's done with his morning salmon oil. Maybe he's thanking me. He eats his food that I put it on so I guess it's good. Living in Minnesota the winters get pretty dry and he's not always scratching when he's getting his salmon oil. I do keep it in the refrigerator so it doesn't go bad.

16860,0,"This is our second unit, and I find this one superior in some ways, but inferior in others. I do appreciate the on/off switch, which was a glaring omission on previous models. However, the microphone is far too sensitive and sprays my dog at inappropriate times such as when he yawns. There is no way to adjust the sensitivity, and this unnecessary correction confuses him. It is also easily set off my my other dog barking withing a few feet of him. The collar is fitted correctly and tight to his neck, but the problems persist."
17089,0,"Purchased to retrain our buddies to not bark reactively when the other barks. Went on the juvenile dog first and only took a few sprays to stop the behavior. Now all we have to do is show him the collar if he starts barking to make him stop. Next, it went on our senior dog. It didn't fit her small neck well and it kept getting too loose on her. She was pretty much oblivious to the spray when it did activate. While the old girl was hogging the dog bed, the other dog decided to approach the bed to try to intimidate his way on to it.(without barking now...yay!) Well, the old dog started barking, and the sprayer activated shooting the young dog in the face. He made the attempt three times with the same result. It was so stinking funny! He ran off whimpering and now avoids the dog bed by skirting the walls and hiding under furniture to get to the other side of the room. So for the little guy it worked too well. On the old one, she's still clueless. I don't recommend for small dogs less than 15 lbs, it is just not sized proportionately for any smaller. Our dogs are 9 lbs and 10 lbs."

177610,0,"I ordered the 1 quart bowl. The product description says it has a removable anti-skid rubber base, but there was no rubber base on the one we received. Our 25 lb. dog is able to push it around while she's eating so the base would have been nice but it wasn't worth the hassle to return it.The bowl does feel heavy duty - not heavy duty as in weight (it is very light) but rather heavy duty as in it could probably take a lot of abuse before showing it. We've taken it camping where it sits on rocks, dirt and gets banged around and it looks as good as the first day we bought it.Like others said, the sticker is certainly stuck on there. We followed another reviewer's advice and let it soak in vinegar overnight. The sticker came right off."

75029,0,"My dogs absolutely love these treats, but I'm not so sure about the dental benefits. The dogs don't seem to have any less tartar on their teeth although their breaths are a little fresher. I still need to use toothpaste and a toothbrush to clean their teeth and the harder rawhide type chews seem to work better on the tartar. I will still give these treats to my dogs because they really like the taste and texture."
36326,2,"Used on my 10 pound poodle. Within a few days had fleas again. Two weeks into treatment had a tick! He's four years old and has never had a tick. This product is absolutely worthless! Not to mention, after putting it on him, he ran around the house like a nervous wreck for 24 hours and salivated a lot. I felt terrible! Never again!!!! I wrote the company a letter and they sent me a form letter reply, telling me to send them the unused portion and original receipt for refund. That's it. No, ""we're sorry you were disappointed,"" nothing."
1524,1,"I bought this product for my dads dog Shadow, she was having a lot of difficulty getting up and down. She still has a limp but is chasing rabbits, wagging her tail and moving more freely in general. This made them both very 'Happy'."
19851,0,This is way to expensive! Yes it works GREAT and it does exactly as its suppose. It keeps my dog from taking off or going after other animals but to much money.
211463,0,"Our Bichon puppy did use these steps after training him with treats, but he stumbles because the step depth is way too narrow, and it has too many stairs to navigate. Maybe they would be suitable for a teacup or a chihuahua. Our puppy's gait skipped steps and he fell off the sides once. Our other Bichon Frise, who was ill, really had a hard time using the stairs. I give this product 3 stars because it works, just not very well. So we decided to replace the Pup Solve it stairs with the Pet Gear Easy Step I Pet Stairs, 2 Step, which is pretty much perfect for $25, and we are very happy with them."

133859,1,"I got this product for my 30-month-old Corgi/Chihuahua after my vet recommended getting a supplement with fatty acids due to the fact he chronic dry skin. Within a month he was doing great. His coat is very shiny even if it has been almost a month since his last bath. The funny thing is if you smell his scalp, he smells like fish! This is more of a funny thing than a problem. I bought a big bottle for a little dog (only one pump a day) so I keep it refrigerated per the advice of an earlier review."
24156,0,It's a great product I can let my akita run in the park LOVE IT.the one problem that I see with this product is the battery not even 20 hours of use and the battery dies. Battery very expensive.10.00 a piece.If it were not for the battery it would be worth the price.Annette
100469,0,"My dog hates sleeping on a hot dog bed, so this looked like a great alternative. The first bed I bought started leaking from the seems after about 3 weeks. I returned it and got another because my dog liked it so much. Now the only issue I have is that my dog likes playing with the small red air bleed nipple on the bottom, and she occasionally gets it open causing a leak. You should not use this bed anywhere that you would be worried about a minor leak, and you need to check the bed occasionally to ensure that it isn't leaking. It would probably be much better if they relocated all of the openings to the middle of the bottom of the bed where a dog would have a much harder time pulling up a corner and playing with them.If your dog likes laying on the tile or wood instead of a big fluffy bed, your dog will probably love this bed."

189939,0,"When I purchased this item, I intended to place it on top of a large storage container to elevate my dog's food dish, and hold it relatively still. My dog is 100#. This mat is virtually useless to me. I misunderstood the ""slightly raised bumps on the flat surface to hold the pets bowl in place"" as also being rubberized. They are not. They are the same slick plastic the rest of the mat is made of. I don't see how this could possibly hold his dish in place. Just the force of his tongue against the dish would have it sliding all over. The only thing the mat holds in place is itself. The description should have a disclaimer that it is for pets under 25 pounds. If I had cats, I would definitely make use of it and rate it higher. For now I'll stick with my industrial strength Velcro!"
70686,2,"Do NOT buy this product. I bought it for my 10 month-old lab who barks excessively at night. My husband and I tested the device before placing it on our dog (if it beeps when the sensors are run over a rough surface, it's supposed to be working) and waited to see what the dog's reaction would be. For about an hour he didn't bark at all, but every now and then the collar would beep, then he'd shake his head and scratch at the collar, as if it were irritating. We thought he was just getting used to the feel of the collar. About 90 minutes after we placed the collar on the dog, he was munching on a rawhide toy not barking, growling or anything, when he leapt into the air about 3 feet, yelped and started crying and frantically running around. We chased him to try to hold him and take the collar off. But before we could catch him he was shocked again because he jumped into the air a second time and yelped. We finally caught him and took the collar off. The instructions say the dog's first reaction to the shock will be the strongest, and we expected he would have some discomfort and be surprised but the dog WAS NOT BARKING when he was shocked."

132390,0,"my cat bit through the mesh and within seconds was crawling out of his carrier. This was while underneath the airplane seat before takeoff, so you can imagine the panicked wrestling match that occurred until I was able to put the bag on my own lap and handle the situation easier. The carrier is amazing, but being made of mesh is useless for a cat who attempts to escape. This was the return flight home, meaning his first flight he made it through in tact. But all it took was one moment of &#34;I want out!&#34; and he accomplished that."
90851,0,This bed works for the price I paid. It's not the best but does work. I keep it outside in the summer on the patio. I noticed the material started to get a bit torn but still working for now. For the price I can get 3 or 4 beds compared to getting a similar higher end dog bed.
189337,0,"If you have large turtles this is great. I received 5/16 size pellets and my 4"" red ear slider wanted nothing to do with it. I gave mine to my father in law who has a larger RES and he likes it. I turtle refused to eat it. If you want large pieces of food I would try it especially for the price. I have read they send out different sizes of food so you might get small pieces to. Its a crap shoot. Good luck"
4107,0,"The dispenser works pretty much as you would expect, but the plastic is pretty thin. The dispensing handle won't stay up if there's nothing in the container, so refilling it when new or completely empty is a two person or three handed operation, assuming you are pouring a 40 pound bag of dog food into the top.The spout at the bottom is very wide as well, which makes it very difficult to dispense into a measuring cup, or anything smaller than a dog's dish."
38655,1,"I got this box for my recently adopted cat. I know myself pretty well, so I try to make every tedious task as easy and fuss-free as possible, and this litter box totally fits the bill. This box is so easy to clean and my cat loves it as well. I'm already planning to get another for downstairs. I will never buy any other type of litter box again. I had been considering an automatic litter box, but now there's no need. This box is perfect. I have had no trouble with leaking litter, or with litter clumps sticking to the bottom. The key to prevent sticking, I believe, is to fill the box with enough litter and to clean it at least twice a day, if not more. And use a high-quality, low-dust litter which forms solid clumps. I use Precious Cat clumping litter, and I have no problems with sticking, dust, or odor."
143395,0,"All in all I like the privacy tent. However, it should be made out of heavier-duty PVC material. I have several fat cats who like to use the top of the tent to lay on or to use it as a springboard to pounce onto other things. Unfortunately the current model isn't sturdy enough for this type of treatment. I always have to reinforce the structure with sturdier PVC material. It would be nice if Littermaid made it more sturdy to begin with."

6522,1,"Hi, Our names are Linus and Schroeder and we are Bichon Frises. This product works miracles. It is a little pricey, but that's the only complaint our mom and dad have. Everytime we encounter a Poodle, or Maltese they stop to ask how we got rid of our stains and we always recommend this product. The stains were so bad at one point that they were starting to leave sores under our eyes (OUCH), but Angel's Eyes took them away in about 2-3 weeks. We noticed improvement after 3-4 days. BUY this product...but leave some for us!!! Sincerely, Linus and Schroeder"
52777,0,Sock works as designed... but gave it only 3-stars because 1) it has a draw-string/tie attachment which can be difficult to attach to feeder. You can get them with an elastic band at the top - MUCH easier to mount! And 2) they are relatively short. There are longer ones available. Get the longer ones... you don't have to refill them as often!
210378,0,"this litter box works better than a lot of other automated boxes out there, but overall it can be pretty annoying. it works well for a few days, but when it is time to clean out and completely change the litter (which is a little more often than a regular box because the movement seems to break up the clumps a bit), it turns into a pretty big hassle. lots of plastic parts and curved surfaces mean you'll be scraping. a lot. not fun. using arm and hammer to line the surfaces helps a bit, but it's still a pain. also, there's no way to put a lid on this, so if you have an inbred dog, you'll have to figure out how to section it off. i finally gave up and went back to the classic scoop every day box. this was great for weekend trips though."
91419,0,"A bit disappointed by this bed. Seems durable enough, but the fabric doesn't extend all the way to the corners, which allowed my dog to get his snout in there and start chewing. Just a little bit of extra fabric would have prevented this. It's stable if left on the ground, but when you pick it up the legs go a bit wonky due to the fabric pulling on them, which loosens the screws. This is a great bed for dogs that don't chew if you plan on leaving it in the same place most of the time."
56883,0,"I think this went on fine, but is not a solution for a dog that bites people, unfortunately. A dog could get it off, and could bite in the process."
82158,0,"The product works great at preventing hairballs, but it is not easy to give the medince to the rabbit. The package says put the product on ur finger and the rabbit will lick it off. well I had diffcult with that because my rabbit took one siff of the stuff and did'nt like the smell of it at all. Maybe they should try makeing bannana and carrot flavors because she does not like it. I have to have my mom hold her down while i try and wipe it on her face that works for her."
104321,1,I'm sorry but my goldfinches couldn't find the holes. They just stood up & smacked the side wall looking for the hole. I gave it to a friend & hers figured it out fine. I bought a little 'sock feeder' & my gold finches are happy now. I gave it over 2 months try & they just looked at it funny. I recommend this if you have above average goldfinches.
140721,0,"It works fine. I wish the motor was stronger but I guess it works out because when the dog moves and the grinder hits my nail, it doesnt do much damage. Only problem is that it still takes a considerable amount of time to do. I have to take breaks to let the dog rest."

135342,2,"This looks good in the picture, but is very poor quality. The cover doesn't fit the flimsy frame well at all, and the puppy is afraid to use it. I have taller stair of a different brand that he's fine with, so I guess I'll be ordering a smaller replacement for this one. Total waste of money and of an hour assembling this!"
177795,1,"My prior Chi had a Bungee Cat that she loved, kept it after she passed. When I got my new pup, I didn't want her playing with it so purchased this one. Well, it's a must have, she loves it and it's her favorite."
715,0,This is a pretty chintzy product. First it arrived in pieces due to poor packaging. The windows are flimsy plastic that do not fit all that well as two of them came out during shipping. Easily put back in place however they all rattle. The feeding wells are not well designed. This was $20 and it is perhaps worth $10. You need to look for something better and/or less expensive as this one is not a very good value.
101273,0,"I bought this for a dachshund/lab mix. He would only chew it IF I was trying to take it several time. The flavor just wasn't there for him to be interested. So I boiled some chicken broth and waited for it to cool a smidgen and let the nylabone sit in it for 15 minutes. I let it cool completely and now he's happy chewing! I have been watching him closely to make sure he doesn't eat plastic but he's doing great chewing. If you can't get your dog to enjoy it, I suggest trying that."
216054,0,"I was really excited about purchasing this item for my cats, honestly I'm sick of being their climbing tree. I got the product about three days after I ordered it, I actually just got notification that it was shipped today but UPS sent me a notice (from their own website) that I was receiving the product today. When I got the box it was in perfect condition, opened it, felt the carpet and was so excited by the quality of the cat tree. Then I pulled out the directions, well that is when all hell broke loose. First I was missing a part of the stairs, the directions are pointless I tried to follow them but after step two I was over them. So there are a few things not put together, I am missing one of the rings below a perch but it's up and my cats love it, so I guess it was worth it but seriously hire someone to put this together or have a cat tree raising party or something."
140574,0,"I knew from reading reveiws that this was tiny, but when I got it I was astounded. I was VERY surprised my 8 month old kitten could even turn around in it, but he had just pooped in it so maybe that gave him some extra incentive :| Anyway, probably would be suitable for a small chi or yorkie? Seriously, VERY small. Good quality though, I dont think I'll ever use it again (even after disinfecting)"

207137,0,This would be a great item for a very small breed of dogs. Unfortunately I thought it was bigger than what it actually was and my dog is too large to utilize this for everyday use for water and food. Had to return only due to the size otherwise would have made a great addition for my pet.
59538,2,"After using for a couple of months, I am not satisfied with the product. My dog still is annoyed by fleas. Perhaps I got a bad batch but will try another brand next time."
125435,0,"Given the rather large size of the small chipmunk, I thought the small fox would be perfect for my 50 lb dogs who sometimes enjoy small furry things. This toy appears so diminuative, though, I was taken aback. The stated dimensions say that it's at least 8 inches! So far, they've shown little interest in it, even though it's a great looking toy--for a Small Dog!"
93300,0,"I read many reviews and it seems like it either works or doesn't. So, I tried it for my dog who was abused and is very skittish and afraid of every noise and movement. When I got the first one, she came out of her safe place and actually followed me around, etc. I figured the collar really worked or there was an amazing transformation. However, a couple weeks later, she seemed to go backwards. Since the collars are only good for a month, I ordered another one and also bought the spray. This time, there was no affect at all to either the collar or the spray. We've only had her 3 months and she's come a long way since we first got her so we'll just keep on loving her and trying to make her happy."
65095,1,"Had been buying Greenies at local &#34;farm store&#34; distribution warehouse in smaller count container for several years. However, being a distribution wartehouse meant inconcistent availability of either Greenie or package size. While exploring Amazon's site for another item availablility stumbled upon Greenies and several other pet products we use. Initially we were worried about freshness of products, but let us allay any concerns -- our three dogs are proof positive there is not one thing wrong with pet products purchased through Amazon. In fact, Amazon has become our preferred purchase point for not only pet products, but also a wide variety of items."
58155,2,"This is a great idea and I had such high hopes. My 8 mo old Shepherd is very active and rough. We have tile floors in the house and concrete outside.

It it were made of hardier material I would buy another but this plastic is just too brittle for a rough dog."

25407,2,"I bought these mice hoping Pet Stages' claim is true about them helping to reduce tartar. My cat has a furry mouse toy filled with catnip, and she loves it. I put that one away and replaced it with a chew mouse. It remained in the same place for several days. I dangled it in front of her and tossed it, but she wouldn't touch it. She didn't sniff it or bat it with her paw out of curiosity. I even used catnip spray on the chew mouse, since she goes crazy for anything I spray. Still no interest. So these chew mice will be donated to a thrift store which supports an animal shelter."
200637,0,I see lots of hype about how this is the best thing since the last best thing. I'm not seeing it. I've used other combs on my Husky/Lab mix in the past and they do as good if not better. I think what works for this on my dog is if I press harder and &#34;dig in&#34; a bit. Maybe that's the trick. It's an okay unit. I wouldn't have paid $40 for it.
210742,0,"After a year with this system and new batteries every month, I am frustrated. Both are medium-sized dogs.One dog never goes out, but runs the border constantly. The other dog runs through the border (even on high voltage with a big warning boundary) or stands at the warning boundary until the batteries go dead (the collar beeps before it shocks) and then escapes. A no win situation. Although they don't escape as much as they used to, still I have to go in the neighborhood to find him, and he gets raw spots on his neck from the shocks he receives. Not for stubborn dogs !"

43647,0,"I'm between two and three stars on this one.My cat likes to bury her business really well, I guess, so she digs around a little bit after she uses the litter box. So far, this has completely destroyed the clumping effect. Instead of one or possibly two, giant, hard chunks for each time she pees like I would get with clay litters, I get about 15 teeny tiny ones. Since there are so many and they're so small, its nearly impossible to remove completely with scooping, so I could see how it could start to smell bad (I haven't been using it long enough to tell.) Scooping even one 'session' up also takes quite a while.However, so far it has done fine to control smells and the litter itself smells pretty good. It seems a little dusty, but no more than the litter, and I like that there is no strip mining involved in harvesting this product. I prefer having a box of it in my house to a box of the perfumey, dusty, dirty clay litter. Also, my cat doesn't seem to mind it at all.Unfortunately, the poor clumping ability will probably cause the litter to get dirty much faster than clay and need to be thrown out. Because of this, I'll probably keep trying different brands.I do want to like it, though, so I'm kind of just holding out and hoping my cat will decide she doesn't want to dig through her pee anymore. Yeah right.And on the bugs: Swheat Scoops website addresses this. They assure customers that the bags leave their facilities bug free and they go into detail about the process they use to kill any bugs. They say that bugs can only infest the product from warehouses. Perhaps getting it from certain stores will be more bug-free than others?"
135300,2,"This morning I saw a red-tailed hawk swoop up and grab one of the little pine siskins in this cage feeder, right through the bars. I had thought the birds were safe in this feeder, but it turned out to be not quite true. The hawk had trouble pulling his foot back out of the cage with the pine siskin trapped in his claws, but he finally managed it.Even though Duncraft makes some great bird feeders, there are three reasons why I would not buy this model again:--red squirrels can squeeze through the bars and get at the seed--the cage bottom is very difficult to clean. The discarded husks, seeds, and bird droppings create a formidable cement, even after just one day (as I said, the small birds really like this feeder)--hawks can reach through the bars and extract the smaller birds"
20614,1,"These petite chews, which are more suited for toys breeds, are a good treat that also helps to clean your dog's teeth. I've experimented between the petite and small size chew and found, that for my dogs, the petite is preferred. They can actually consume these, which they do, rather quickly. That's the only down side...they don't last long. The price here at Amazon is much better than what my vet charges for these, even with shipping, if you buy several packages at a time."
184935,1,"This product is PERFECT for your pet on those chilly nights. We have 2 boxers that sleep in separate beds and they used to sleep in tight little balls but now they lie sprawled out from one end of the beds to the other!The warmer doesn't get too hot (which is good) so you have to place it under a slender piece of material or it doesn't work very well. For example, one of our beds is a normal egg shell with a fabric cover and we have the warmer inside of a pillowcase and zipped up between the fabric and egg shell and it works great. On the other bed, it has a thick pillow as a base so we had to put the warmer on top of the pillow and then cover it with a blanket; otherwise, with the warmer under the pillow the top of the pillow never got warm. The key thing to remember is that these are WARMERS so they don't feel warm enough to a person but they get PLENTY warm for a pet.Update: 01/23/2012These warmers are both still going strong/warm... they have been used nightly for anywhere from 8 - 10 hours for 4 months out of the past 3 years. No problems at all! We will buy these again if the need arises and I recommend them without a doubt to anyone that is looking for an affordable warmer."
141188,0,"My cats, all playful, adore this toy. It whistles through the air and before the cats start chewing the feathers, it's totally realistic. The feathers are still in decent shape after all the chewing. I bought the pole with two replacement feathers. This morning, one cat chewed through the string and now I have a pole with a little bit of string on it. I thought this was well designed but alas, it's not. It's reasonable to assume a cat will bite the string when trying to catch the feather."

47715,1,"We have a 9 year old 120 lb. Mastiff/Sheepdog mix that has had ear infections her entire life. She has been to 3 different vets to remedy the problem, and nothing helped. I had to clean her ears and use a cortizone remedy for yeast a least 3 times a week or her ears became enflamed and were painful. I heard about the Blue dog food, and I liked the ingredients used. So we decided to try it. I couldn't believe that within 2 weeks, her ears were no longer squishy with fluid inside, and the smell went away. We have been using both the dry and the canned Blue formulas and after 2 months there has been no recurrence of infection or inflammation. In the 9 years we have had her, we have tried at least 4 other brands of dog food including some of the high end expensive ones. It had never dawned on us that her food might be causing the infections in her ears. Thanks to Blue dog food, our girl will not have to endure the pain of ear infections the rest of her life."
470,0,Was told by online puppy seller that I would need this product when I received my new puppy. My vet says it is mostly sugar and my dog does not need this product. So I regret my purchase. I also purchased the version for older dogs based on the seller's recommendation. Shame on me.
60491,2,"Due to our last winter not being cold enough we have really had a big problem with fleas. I've been treating my pets with Advantix for years and it simply wasn't working this year. I read that I should try Frontline ( different chemical, maybe better results). But it didn't work either....I have sprayed their kennels, dog houses etc, even been treating them with DE. There are fewer fleas but they still have some. Will try a different product after this one's effects have worn off. The Advantage for cats if working great though. Don't think its the product, but for me it didn't help.Will pray for a cold winter, too."
110235,1,"My dogs LOVE these bones. If they aren't chasing a ball, they keep themselves busy chewing away at these. The Nylabone bones are quite durable.

91307,0,"The bed is high quality and I found it very easy to set up. The problem is -- none of my three dogs will actually use it!

Any ideas on how to make it more enticing?"

We have a weiner dog with a flare for all night long barking (at nothing) after the first night he wore this it was weeks before he started barking again and even then it took only one night to refresh his memory that barking is not allowed at night at our home...Thanks Rebekah and Jim NelsonPhoenix AZ.
106266,1,Just received this bowl in the mail and it is purple and does have a guinea pig and footprints but they are printed on. The bowl pictured here is a colored glaze no colored glaze look to it.

My son thinks it is great for the his new little friend.
190475,1,"This is very generously sized for a cat. There was enough room in the ""main"" compartment for our cat's ashes, plus the condolence card from our vet, plus a nice size piece of her favorite fleece blanket, plus a clipping of her fur without having to cram it in either. In fact, we left her ashes in the hard plastic ""delivery urn"" that she was in when we picked her up from the vet. So there's lots of room to please sentimental owners with lots of precious treasures/reminders.As the pictures show, there is room for a photo right on the main part of the box.But the top is really a bonus ... it is just deep enough to be used as a shadow box which is better than just a place for a photo. We were able to put one of her collars and two of her ID tags in there to keep in plain sight always plus we fit three or four of her favorite toys in the shadow box too without crowding (milk jug ring, sewing machine bobbin, and a couple more of the kind of toys that cats choose for themselves and repeatedly ""burgle"" from us).We originally wanted a beautiful ""urn"" but we are so glad that we bought this instead. Next time we need another urn we will buy this again instead."
8061,1,"I have two small dogs who often travel with me in the car and who have a tendency to not sit still during the entire trip. I had previously had a dog car seat that resembled a plastic tub with foam inside and a cover on top of it. It worked for a short period of time, but due to the design of it and my dogs moving around, it always tipped over. I finally talked myself into getting a Buddy Lookout car seat, and I'm so glad I did. Not only is it stable and comfortable for them, but it also allows them to move around without me worrying if it will fall over. The dogs actually enjoy the ride more now because they are so elevated, they are able to see everything outside where as before they had to stand on their hindlegs in order to look out the window. I also feel much better knowing that they are secure in their seat and that if I need to brake suddenly that they are not going to go flying into the backside of my driver seat. It's also much safer for me now because I don't have to worry about the dogs wanting to try to get in my lap while I'm driving - which has almost caused a few mishaps in the past!"

My cats are a little picky about their treats but seem to really enjoy these, and usually have them gone before I can close the bag. If they are happy then so am I."

115119,0,"We bought the first of these beds at a pet store when we got our dog, and it lasted five years as a crate liner, including machine washing every week, and a lot of rooting around and ""nesting"". It did so well that I searched online until I found the manufacturer to get an exact replacement. This second bed only lasted six months before it split open in the washer, making a heck of a mess. I'm about to buy a third one, hoping that the second was just a fluke (or that Diego had chewed a hole in it that I didn't see).I particularly like the non-slip backing, which keeps the bed more or less in place."

So, we still have a watch pooch but not a yapping pooch! And, the Citronella Spray Refills are easy to use in refilling the spraying mechanism container on the collar. Do check battery often. Do check collar often to maintain appropriate tightness/looseness so collar does not fall off. Do refill collar at least daily or more often to maintain consistent spraying of Dog when barking to reinforce selective barking habits.

The fabric is just cheap, I'm planning on making something waterproof one day. The sponge seat is just a big sponge and I'm sure that doesn't cost that much. But I guess I have no other choice since there aren't many pet car seat to choose from.I got small since it's good for dogs up to 18 lbs. I have a mini schnauzer and he's 14 lbs now, but I don't think he will grow much anymore since both of his parents are only 10 lbs. But this car seat is kind of small for my dog. I don't know how any 18lb dog can fit in it. He can sort of lay down but not like the picture. There's no way he can be in this seat like the picture. Either he has to sit, or he has to stand diagonally, or he has to curl up in it. I'm still going to use this though.Now I think about it, I think it would be better if they also had the dimensions of inside of the seat."

172214,1,I recently purchased a 30H X 24 8 panel play yard in black. I cant say enought for this product. Very manageable for me as I am a senior female and not very strong. My sheltie puppy just loves it. She sits for hours and watches everything that is going on around her. I put it up on my carport to keep it out of the sun as I live in Florida. I am hoping to add panels as she gets larger. I cant say enough regarding the pleasure and security it has provided for myself and my sheltie. You cant beat the price and the quality is just outstanding. I would highly recommend this product. Great job people.

I recommend getting the Giant Silent Spinner for those animals. It is more expensive, but so is buying two wheels. :D Unlike the Giant Silent Spinner, this one either requires you to have a barred cage or to zip tie the stand to the cage, the Giant one actually screws to a mesh cage (1"" x 1/2"" wire). I wish they'd make the smaller wheels like that."
142030,2,"I initially rated this item 5 stars because it worked well and quickly at softening the tartar which allowed it to flake off. However, both of my dogs (15 year old border collies) started to get sick after about 6 days on the product. They started vomiting and got diarrhea. My other dogs that were not on the product did not get sick so I attribute the digestive upset to this oral gel. I used less than the recommended amount, but perhaps the product is just too strong for elderly dogs' digestive systems.In summary, the product worked well at softening plaque but the digestive side effect was troublesome. I switched to an algae powder food additive that worked much more slowly but didn't make my dogs sick (Proden Plaqueoff, which I also got through the Amazon site)."

(Pet owner needs to consider if switch is needed depending on application.)Unique system does in fact run on low heat until kitty hops into hutch, then step up heating seems acceptable to kitty, so far.Unusual air pillow design is important for uniform heat distribution. It seems as if the elements are heating the air within the pad so use the button valve to release excess air and then it is pushed shut to seal the pillow/pad air chamber.Cover is fleece on top only with plastic sleeve ends and no bottom seal, obviously not meant for damp or wet applications.Very good value delivered speedily in good condition."

155439,2,"I guess if all you are going for is a certain look then this is ok. A regular litter box with a lid would work just the same as this and it would take up less space. I like the look of the cabinet but in order to keep the floor from having kitty litter all over the place I have to turn the cabinet with the door facing the back wall. I used to have a corner litter box with a lid and there was a lot less mess on the floor with that than having an open litter box inside this cabinet. It just wasn't worth the money for any reason. It takes up too much space, you can still see the litter box, and it doesn't help with the mess. My cat is not one of those cats who just kicks litter up real high all over the place. He is pretty tidy, but there isn't much that can be done to avoid a mess with this cabinet. If you are looking for one then you should probably try your luck with one that is a little longer so there will be more space between the litter box and the door. Hope this helps!"
83912,2,"Having owned 11 cats over the course of 23 years and having had to dispense many medications to older cats, I found that this device is worse than useless. Instead of fighting with the cat to get the pill in, you wind up fighting with the piller. The split rubber tip will hold medication IF you don't lubricate it with anything and IF the pill is the right size. If you put hairball gel on a pill to help the cat swallow, and you miss once, you'll spend most of the rest of your attempt putting the slippery pill back inside the rubber tip and then retrieving it to try again as it seems to pop out spontaneously. If you have to give a cat a half-dose and the pill isn't snug in the tip, be prepared---you will likely get the popper right to the cat's mouth and the pill will fall out.Ergonomically, this device is a mess. It's too long to maneuver comfortably if you are trying to hold a squirming cat with your other hand, and getting the plunger pushed in is an exercise in frustration.The only time I will use this is if the cat is an involuntary biter---chomps down when they feel something in the jaws---and draws blood.And I'm considering just doing it with gardening gloves next time for the cat I'm currently pilling."

When I took him in for his initial vet visit, he passed with flying colors except for the fact that his coat was very dull and his skin was dry and flaky. I was advised to try fish oil supplements. I bought this product thinking it was among the best. When the product arrived with my other mail, it had leaked out onto everything and about 1/4 bottle was gone. Amazon replaced immediately. After about 3 weeks of use, my dog's coat was looking much better. I was very pleased. However, towards the end of the bottle (about 1/8 left), he started getting loose stool which progressed into 5 days of the worse diarrhea I had ever seen in an animal. At this point, I had stopped giving the oil and put him on a bland diet. He recovered soon after. Not wanting to blame the oil which he had been using for a while with no problems, I decided to give it to him again, in a smaller dose, and the same darn thing happened. I felt so bad for him and blamed myself. I ended up having to discard the oil. I had used the product as indicated, but for some reason my doggy developed an intolerance. Please be ware when using this product and monitor your pets."
167473,0,"My wife and I bought this product for our 3 chinchillas. Overall the wheel is fun for them to play with since they can spin the ball while eating. The problem we had was that chinchillas chew on everything, like most rodent family pets, and the outside plastic only snaps onto the metal cage in a few areas. Well after chewing for a week or two the plastic snaps end up chewed as well. In the end we just super glued the plastic back onto the metal cage and havent had a problem since.Additionally - putting the hay inside the small cage door can be annoying for 2 reasons. 1.) the locking mechanism for the cage door is just the cage interlocking with itself with tension. Its effective for keeping the hay in but resulting in our first cage door breaking since it wasnt obvious how it closed. 2.) its just small and hard to get a large handful of hay into the hole without spilling some of it.Lastly, I'm not sure that any other product could do a better job, but when our chinchillas pull out the hay, more than what they eat comes out and usually ends up dropping to the floor which ends up being wasted.Overall - its fun, hangs well, stays closed, but for our chinchillas who chew none stop, it has a few design flaws."
183425,0,"This product is not for use around the house, as a couple reviewers have said. It is for use directly on the animal. I bought five bottles thinking I could spot spray around the house but, in fact, it is not meant for that.The label specifically says that it is for application on animals and that another product (Sephitrol) is to be used if there are already fleas in the house. The label also states that the spray should not be applied to, or damp animals allowed to come into contact with, ""painted or finished surfaces, including wood floors/furniture, leather/vinyl materials, or other surfaces of concern."" Furthermore, if you get it on your clothes you are supposed to wash your clothes immediately. Maybe you did not have problems but it is NOT for use around the house.

104316,2,"We've used a similar design before, and it works well. The ""upside down"" feeding largely ensures only goldfinches will use it, and they tend to fly in and out, without hanging around the backyard deck leaving a mess. Our last feeder lasted over ten years; this will last six months. The greatest defect is the flimsiness of the main tube. It has to hold all the niger seeds; keep the perch bars in place and prevent them from spinning when the birds rotate; hold the bar that the unit hangs from; and securely keep the bottom ""v"" in place, which keeps the seeds from falling out, yet must occasionally be removed for cleaning. But this tube is such a thin plastic that it will never hold up under the sunlight and weather; its flexibility allows for too much movement of the stationary parts; and it it surely won't be an impediment for other animals. Mine arrived warped, and the small tabs of the ""v"" would not engage the tube's cutouts. The slightest flexing of the tube caused the ""v"" to disengage, causing the seeds to fall out. About 1"" beneath the ""v"" there are two additional holes in the tube at the bottom of the unit (as for another perch) and as a fix I inserted a dowel and cut a piece of wood to make up the gap to the bottom of the ""v"". That should hold it in place... for as long as the tube itself holds up. I'm not hopeful.In short, look for a feeder using this design, but avoid this product."

85699,0,"Some background info about my pup: She tugs and pulls everywhere we go. It's like she doesn't even recognize me at the other end of the leash while at home she listens to everything I say. Sometimes she likes to make my life harder when she hops 4-5 ft instead of walking. She is a 45 lb labrador/hunting hound mix. When she sees squirrels, she gets into hunting position with her body low against the ground and walks like a lion about to catch its prey. She goes from an angle where the squirrel cannot see her. When she is 5 ft from the squirrel she will make such a prounce that it feels like my arm has been almost ripped out if I'm not careful. I still love her though.About the Product: This leash has done the job for casual walks. I will NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of retractable leash if I know we will be in an area where I want her to be close, controlled and safe next to me. I just don't trust my pup too far away on a thin leash like this (even if it is all belted) with her hyperactivity and strength. Any moving object will make her go crazy and she can EASILY snap a leash like this especially if she is 16 ft out since I have less control the farther she is. I use it only on night walks when I know there are not many squirrels or distracting things outside. She has her freedom to walk a little bit more on the grass and go to the bathroom. Other than that, for her exercise I will take her to a dog park, baseball field or by the waterfront near me on a sturdy 6 ft leash where I run along with her.I would recommend retractable leashes for small dogs (yorkies, chihuahuas, malteses, etc.) I would not recommend retractable leashes for hyper dogs (of any size really other than toy size) or large dogs especially if it's somewhere risky or not safe. This leash is great for casual walks where you want your dog to have some bit of freedom."
168122,2,"The break feature failed and the leash did not retract as my puppy was crossing the street, he almost got hit by a car. I contact the company and they said they would send me a new leash immediately and it would arrive in 1 week. It had been 5 weeks and no leash. I would not recommend this leash. Go with another company."
87571,2,"The color looks like a beautiful bright lavender on my computer screen, but boy is it different in real life! It was a dull greyish purple. Also, the place where the color was stitched together was uneven and the end was rough. For the price I'm not going to mess with return shipping. Maybe a local animal shelter will take it."
55641,0,"My husband and I adopted two female puppies last year (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian both 3 months old) and quickly learned that these girls were chewers! So my husband went on the hunt for a good chew toy that could stand up to their constant chewing. Oila...the teething ring was a huge hit by the girls! They loved it and would 'argue' over who got to chew on it. It lasted for a good three months before the plastic started to come off in little chunks, after which time we discarded it. A few months later, I found the same teething ring here on Amazon and quickly ordered two more of the beloved chew toys. By this time the girls were a year old and have apparently strengthened their chewing muscles beyond what the ring can withstand. Within one hour, the Yorkie was tearing large pieces off of her ring, so in the trash it went. The other ring was not far behind...within two days it was also coming apart in pieces. Now, we rely on Kong toys, deer antlers, and bully sticks to satisfy our girls' strong urge to chew. They are pricier products, but they can really withstand our strong chewers."

Even tho it states on the tag 2-5 lbs so now having to order the teacup for less than 2 lbs. Even if i add velcro which I seriously thought about I will need to add about 2 inches and decided that at the neck that wouldn't work.
111615,0,"This has the great Nylabone quality, but my dog is not interested in it. He loves his Nylabone bones, but this one seems difficult for him to keep in place to chew. He tries to put his paw through the ring to hold it in place, but it falls over so he just leaves it and looks for something else to chew. I think it's just my dog's preference, but I would consider the type of toys/chews your dog likes before buying this one since it's not a typical shape."
29825,1,"My Abbey can find her way around treat toys easily so it's sometimes disappointing to buy a toy that she figures out immediately. This squirrel presents a good challenge to for her. I wish that the solution to making the treat disbursement easier wasn't to cut the little prongs out, though, because that's a permanent fix to a temporary problem. Eventually she will need the challenge to be at a higher level and the little prongs aren't replaceable. Still love the toy, though, and so does my pup!"

114136,1,"This is my second purchase of this manufacturer's product. I purchased a smaller one when I first got my puppy, and he grew so much he needed a new crate and cushion. I bought this one again because I liked the first one so much. It's comfy for my dog. I especially love the soft bolster around the edges, and the fact that I can wash it and dry it at home whenever I need. The previous cushion held up well to being washed frequently, so I have no doubt that this one will as well. I would buy this product again if I get another dog."
156173,0,At first I thought it looked too simple and it was not going to be more difficult for my chihuahua to figure out than her kong. But then she started playing with it and it's actually a lot harder than it looks. The inside really does keep the treats in there for a long time and she sometimes even walks away because it's taking so long. Great toy to really make your dog think!
205020,0,I really loved this and bought it for my yorkie. The tiara is a little heavy so if your pup doesn't have a lot of hair on the top it will not stay up. I tried tying the hair with a rubber band first and then putting the barrette over it but it falls over. Very cute I pin it to the top of her harness but too heavy for her still delicate hair (she's 5 months now).
30364,0,"First, I have not used this pet trainer item, but the input form required me to provide a rating.I trained my dog to [mostly] stay off the sofa and also out of the trash by placing a set up mouse trap (no food involved) covered with a piece of paper on the sofa or on top of the trash. The paper is to help ensure that he won't get pinched by the trap. This has worked very well for me. He never gets in the trash any more. Occasionally he'll start getting on the sofa again, and all I need to do is start laying a piece of paper on it to keep him off.I'm now looking to keep my cat off the kitchen counter. I plan to try the idea I found here - laying out sticky tape with the sticky side up. Thanks for that tip!"

63066,1,"Our 9 month old boxer mix puppy loves this toy. The product is more durable than many plush toys we have given her, especially the box. Although she has managed to split open a few of the balls, the box has endured lots of use with no signs of wear. We stuff treats and other toys in the plush box also to create more variety and fun. Our favorite game with her is to take the balls once she gets them out. It adds to the life of the toy but also keeps her excited. Once she removes them all, we stuff them back in the box and start all over. She loves this game. The toy maintains a high degree of interest even after playing with it for several rounds or several days in a row. The puppy we recently adopted is a special needs dog and is extremely fearful of everything due to a severe lack of socialization. The mental stimulation of this toy has been a real plus in allaying some of her free floating anxiety. Our puppy loves this toy and we love this toy for helping her come out of her shell more. I would recommend this toy very highly for any puppy but especially for anxious puppies."

As far as flea meds go, Advantage has successfully eliminated fleas on some occasions and reduced fleas in others.

10877,2,"When I first bought this leash, I couldn't have been happier. My dog could run all over and the leash would never get caught in her legs. I could let her have 5 feet or 25 feet. It's like she wasn't even on a leash. That all changed in the second week when the cord stopped retracting. Now I have 20 feet of cord laying on the ground and getting caught between her legs.Do yourself a favor and find another brand."
71032,0,"The price and size of this bed were very satisfactory and the cedar in the filling is very nice also. It made my whole room smell nice. The one important flaw with the product however, was the fabric. It is a nylon or something like a taffeta type material...NOT conducive to warm, cuddly comfort. The product description read, ""various patterns"". I didn't know that also meant ""various fabrics."" My Corgi had absolutely no interest in stepping onto it even after I tried covering it with one of his favorite blankets. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I gave it to my daughter for her cats and they're enjoying it but again, only with a blanket covering it. I would rate this product with one star if you're purchasing it for a dog's use."
86577,0,"This leash had good reviews, thats why I bought it! Be aware, this does have a tendency to jam on you. For example while you are walking your dog it is set to release, however it does not and stops your dog from running away. Not sure if I would buy this again."
175235,1,"Unlike regular tennis balls, my dog (young pit bull mix) has trouble destroying these. They are a little heavier than standard tennis balls. But, the extra weight helps for getting extended distance in large fields.Pros:-- Floats on water-- Hard to break these balls-- These are way cheaper on Amazon than at my local pet store-- Better distance when throwing these versus standard tennis ballsCons:-- Possible choking hazard (I would not leave my dog alone with this rubber ball. He is very mouthy.)"
101991,0,"These bags are pretty well made, however, I've encountered 3 bags that were sealed on both ends so I couldn't open them, and 2 that were not sealed at all on either side.Given that they're about 6 cents per bag when you purchase 315 bags (compared to other bags that are half the price), I think they should have a better quality control."

82836,1,"So i just bought this cage for my pitbull. Shes full grown and is crate trained. WE were borrowing a crate and had to give it back. So i found this one. Paid 55 dollars for it and that includes shipping. This thing is huge. I got the one that is 36"". Now any other company that says the cage is that size is nuts. This thing is tall and roomy. Compared the one we were borrowing anyway. The only thing i will say is the pan for the bottom seems a little cheap but who am i to complain. My dogs happy and confortable. She can stand up and not hit her head. Lets put it this way, a grown adult could get inside and sit fine. So, if your dog is about or under 3 ft tall sitting up, then get this cage. plenty of room. or if you have 2 small yappers then this is good too!"
191236,0,"Gets the job done, I have 3 medium sized dogs, but needs regular cleaning the more usage, because dirt and specs from your dogs food and mouth fall and sink into water well and if heavy enough will remain in well and contribute to the water being contaminated after a while. Dogs don't wash their mouths before drinking do they :-) Because these particle are slightly heavier and the position and power of the suction hole, not all is filtered. Once you are willing to dismantle and clean once a week it serves it's purpose."
110975,1,"Despite a few subtle changes over the years I have been using this brand of hay for my rabbit, I still return to it time and time again. I always find the quality higher than what I can find available with other national and local brands.I use this for feed only, not for bedding as my rabbit has mostly free roam of my apartment. The rabbit has never turned his nose up to this hay and always gets excited when I put a handful in his cage."

Who knows but they were alive."
160105,1,"I bought this heater for my baby biorb (4 gal) and it's great for cold winter nights/days. I can just pop this in and bring the temperature back up to a balmy 75 or 80 if I want. A must have for any small tanks where the temperature can fluctuate quickly. My one complaint is that it makes the tank pretty unattractive. Other than that, it's a great heater. I've never had problems with the water overheating."
91271,1,"I originally brought this for my daughter's dog that she brought home upon her return from attending college in Florida. Her dog is a Greyhound/Pit mix and I thought large would have been the right size - WRONG; it's too big. But it was perfect for my son's dog (King)who is a Bull Boxer. It is very accommodating for his large (he comes inches below to my waist & I'm 5'9"")size. King just loves this new bed paired with his favorite bed pillow. When my son tried to take the bed outside so a neighbor could see it, King kept nudging his hand for my son to put it back. Waiting for the medium size one to arrive today and see if my daughter's dog takes to it.Update: I received the Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric (Medium), two days ago (10/10/2012) for my daughter's dog. I liked it, my daughter liked it but the dog didn't. I kept watching her and realized that when I made her get on the bed, she would sit there but she wouldn't lay down and kept lifting each front paws like she was stepping on hot coals. So today, I went to a dollar store and got her a carpet style bath rug. Now she voluntary lays on it and haven't jumped on my bed to nap as of yet."
128645,1,This is an awesome toy for our little yorkie. He loves to take out the little squirels and throw them in the air. He plays with this for a long time and if we stick a bone inside with the squirels he gets really excited. I would recommened this item and Im buying another for my mother in law who recently purchased a yorkie.
213733,2,"I have had good experiences with past purchases of Super Pet products. This Super Pet Hamster Silent Spinner being the exception. I think it may have lasted a week and a half before it started making noise. I tightened the yellow knob in the center thinking that would fix it, and it did for a day or two. Then the noise became worse and the wheel was wobbling when my hamster would run in it. The bearing seemed to have a flat spot that did not allow the wheel to turn smoothly. I am still using the wheel part however and with considerable modification it now works very well. I would not purchase this wheel. This wheel is a perfect example of planned obsolescence. Companies should not be allowed to make something that can't even last two weeks."
31283,0,"When this product works, it is amazing at keeping our naughty cats off of countertops, tables, etc. However, the refill is supposed to provide something like 150+ sprays, and our canisters have consistently run out after maybe 50-75 sprays. I have heard that some people use cans of compressed air from radio shack or other stores instead of these pricey refills."
2096,1,"1) Smells great.2) Doesn't track everywhere.3) Easy to maintain litter box.Easiest way to use this litter:1) Purchase a sifting litter box like the feline pine box or the Breeze. DO NOT buy the Van Ness sifting box, the holes are too big.2)Scoop solids daily with a pellet-specific scoop like the one that comes with the Breeze.3) Sift urine soaked sawdust to the bottom compartment by either shaking the box side to side or scooping the pellets around until the all the sawdust falls through to the bottom. I go with the latter because I don't feel like lifting it.4) Enjoy the rest of your day not worrying about the litter box.Remember to empty out the compartment with the sawdust every few days. I have 1 cat, so you may have to do it more often if you have multiple cats. I also keep the Breeze urine pads as lining in the lower part in case any urine trickles down and to absorb the smell of the sawdust."
172467,0,So sad that this is your only option if you have a littermaid. They are very expensive and are supposed to be used once. I can usually use mine a couple of times before I have to throw it out. Just spray lysol into it between uses.
154063,0,I love the concept by my dogs just are not that into it. It is difficult to rotate the treat door and separate the toy for cleaning and loading but I feel it needs to be tight enough to resist a dogs constant prodding. If the dogs liked it and used it at all I would have given it a higher rating. It does take a small bit of training to let the dogs understand that they will be rewarded for knocking the cube around enough (adjustable reward effort set by changing the size of the opening in the cube center). My dogs do 'get it' but they are just not that into food. They love to play but you cannot throw that hard plastic cube around your house. One day they might find it interesting...
153404,0,"came and I had to send it back because they sent a size too big. I wish that I could've had it a size smaller than what I was ""told"" to order by their guidelines. I have a small English Cocker, and the medium (which is what their size chart said I needed) is way too long on him. It would be nice if it was a little thicker than what it is-- it's pretty thin. Other than that, it's reflective like they say."

68155,0,"The Lazy Pet Plush Cat Condo is best suited to kittens and not large adult cats. Once constructed it approximately measures 13 1/2 inches (34cm) Tall and 13 1/2 inches in diameter. This is a great size for kittens but for owners of large loping cats, such as myself, this is too small for them to curl up inside of.The fur covering the condo is soft and plush with a very short pile and doesn't appear to molt (like I need more fur in my household). The plush fur covers a plywood base which is nearly 1 inch thick, the roof also feels like it is made from plywood, but it is not as thick. The walls of the condo are fur covered cardboard and the interior walls are lined with a tan felt fabric. To prevent the roof from caving in, there are 3 interior ledges that support the roof.The condo assembly doesn't require any tools, it is held together with velcro. Initially I was disappointed with the concept of velcro holding this product together, but it is surprisingly sturdy. The assembly instructions provided were for the two level condo, but I managed to put this together without them. There are 3 pieces - floor, wall, roof. The velcro secures the walls to the base and to the roof, and also fastens the cardboard wall together.Overall I think this is a 3 star product, but 2 stars from me because of it's limited potential use in my cat household. I would have returned this product, but the shipping costs involved would have nearly been as much as the purchase price."
95825,1,"Works very well for removing every bit of poop out of your grass. It's made that job a lot easier; BUT, there are 2 flaws in my opinion: The scoop part is curved upward, so If you're trying to fling the poop elsewhere, it has a boomerang effect and can come right back at ya! (I throw it in a empty wooded lot I own, not a neighbor's yard ;))I also don't know why they didn't make the handle longer. I'm only 5'4"" tall; and between the short handle and oddly curved rake, I really have to crouch down to get the perfect angle so I can catch my prey. It really should not be that difficult. Just make a longer handle, with a straight rake and I'd be soooo happy! That's why I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I do recommend it over all other poop scoopers for grass though. It really speeds up the process."
187429,2,"Not an accurate size reference on the site. The depiction of a lab in all the different size crates as they have can be an epic failure when it comes to ordering this. I went off their reference thinking the smaller size, if it can fit a puppy lab or terrier it can fit my jack Russell. No it does not!!! The smallest size they have is way too small. My jack is 1yr and is as big as he will get. He can fit in the crate but there is no space in there for him to make a 360 degree turn around. This would be a perfect size crate for training and using as a time out for your dog, which I will use it for instead of wasting time shipping it back.Of course I should have measured first. But who has a tape measure immediately at their disposal? I sure didn't. And I was trusting the picture depiction as a reference in buying this which was no good!"
167725,1,this toy is one of the best i've found for the money i spent even though the shipping was as much as the toy was. it is almost indestructible as my dog is an aggressive chewer. bought 4 toys this time. love them all. thanks..
168134,2,Not unhappy with the product My two medium size dogs Love them. I'm unhappy with the company. Buyer be ware I ordered from the picture thinking pink rabbit not so. Received a blue one. Contacted them they said I could return it....great you think....not so at my expense. I know dogs do not see in color but I do and I wanted what I ordered. Like I said buyer be ware....
63357,0,"I tried this on top of my cabinets to keep my cats from hanging out up there and it has worked to make that place uncomfortable so they don't want to be up there. When I tried the same thing on my counter top, the cats took a week or two to get used to the spikes and then stopped giving a toot about them. After that they were more of an inconvenience to the humans than the cats.This product may or may not work for you; it depends on the pet and the desirability of the location. If your pet wants it bad enough, it'll sit on the spikes."

139322,0,"Thought I'd give this herb garden kit a try, even though a few of the reviews were negative.I really thought that the wooden planter was nice in appearance.I liked the idea of the kit having 4 different types of herbs in the seed packet. Some of the reviews said that people had forgotten which herbs were planted where. To solve this problem I used a black permanent marker to show where each herb had been planted.Directions called for 3 oz. of water in each seed cup. Seemed like a lot of water, so after I planted the seeds, made sure to empty the excess water from the bottom plastic tray. Directions called for misting daily.I did not do this until soil felt dryer to the touch.Shoots began to poke through the soil about 2 days later and grew very quickly.Once the herbs began to grow, I started to mist daily. I watered very sparingly to keep mold from forming on the soil. Oats came up slightly brown in color but began to turn green as they grew. After 1 week the herb garden had grown to about 5 or 6 inches. I set the planter out for my 2 cats to enjoy, for about 2 hours each day. So far I haven't seen mold and the Kitties seem happy. Just try not to over water them.Glad I gave this kit a try. It's better than what I had used before. The wooden planter is very sturdy and well made.Hope you will give this kit a try also. Your cats are worth it!Good luck. ShiAdd on : Unfortunately after the plant had grown and been put out for the cats, about a week and a half later I noticed mold forming on the soil. There seems to be a very fine line between over watering and under watering. If you mist every day, which the herb grass seems to require, than it promotes mold. If you don't mist the grass gets whimpy and starts to die.I have 1 refill that I ordered at the time that I purchased the kit. I will plant that, but if I don't have better luck this time quite frankly I can't see myself ordering more refills at 5.61 each when the herb grass only last about a week and a half. I can save the planting trays and go to the local pet store and buy a pack of seeds and some potting soil for much less."
63303,0,"When the product description states ""for dogs up to 150 lbs"" you are not talking about a small animal so I ordered this for my 97 lb golden retriever. So I was very surprised when I opened the box and saw that the paper instructions state: ""For small animals only"" And these stairs are narrow for my dog. I will have to lead him up and down. The also are not tall enough to reach my bed, but would be fine for a couch, heightwise.They were cheap at 21 dollars so I'll keep them but I am still looking for something else that is wider and more sturdy for my dog."

160948,1,"My cats love this toy. My parents old, fat lazy cat loves this toy. I haven't met a cat that didn't at least somewhat enjoy this, either for the scratching or smacking the ball around. If your cat doesn't like it but you want them scratching on it, I'd suggest tossing a little catnip on there and they'll LOVE it. So why only four stars? Couple reasons:1. It can get destroyed by the cats. One of my cats claws at it really aggressively and destroys it rather quickly. I wouldn't mind the destruction if the cardboard didn't get everywhere. Just total shambles. Every month or two I'm picking up the carnage that used to be cardboard. It doesn't happen with my parents lazy old slug, so if you have one of them, you're probably in the clear.2. It can get destroyed by dogs. I have a pair of dogs that have decided that this isn't the cats' toy, but their toy. They wreck their toys and this is no exception. My simple solution was to put this in the cats' room where they can't get at it and it solved this problem, but something to keep in mind.3. The ball pops out fairly easily and can get lost. It gets lost occasionally but the cats end up batting it somewhere at some point where I can find it. But, back on the dog thing, it is small enough for a medium sized dog to choke on, so just be mindful of that.4. The ball in the track is kind of loud. Not THAT loud, but loud enough where I wouldn't want it in my bedroom.In summation, my cats love it, my dogs unfortunately love it and the more they're scratching on this, the less they're scratching on the couch. I highly recommend with the above caveats."

178828,2,"I have 2 kittens that I have been trying to toilet train since they were 3 months old. They progressed to the litter box on the toilet with no issue. I then tried to transition to the citikitty. My male kitten is somewhat overweight and weighed about 13 lbs at the time of this transition. The citikitty was not strong enough to support his weight and would bow if he stepped into it. This totally freaked him out, he then did his business anywhere BUT in the citykitty.I had to start over with a new litter box on the ground. UGH. They are now 10 months old and currently on step 2 of the litter kwitter, which is made of a much sturdier plastic. He is now 16 lbs and appears to feel safe on the litter kwitter as he has not had an ""accident"" since he started using it.That said, my female kitten who is much smaller adapted to the citikitty very well. If I just had her, this product would have worked just fine. The concept of the citikitty and the litter kwitter are the same, I just found the litte kwitter to be much more durable (which also means it's pricier, but does include a ""how to"" DVD that I found helpful)I wish I had this information in the beginning so I could have only purchased and started with the stronger product."

Within 2 hours of having licked his first round of peanut butter out of the Kong, he had gnawed his way through the so called extreme toy--keep in mind my pup weighs 12 lbs. Our first experience was with a normal Kong, and that lasted longer, but he did not have all of his adult teeth at that time. I know people who love Kong, but apparently our 12 lb. beast is just too much for their rubber.I would recommend looking into the tux dog toy!"
105014,2,"I bought the large wheel for my hedgehog who won't even touch it. I thought it was because she's lazy, but I ""ran"" my fingers on the wheel to determine the ease in spinning. It was sticking, hard to move and did not spin fluidly at all. I can see why my hedgehog won't go on it. The only plus is that it is solid so her feet would not theoretically get stuck and it fits perfectly in the cage. None of that matters if the wheel doesn't move."

I bought a pair of these water bottles when I got my first sugar glider, and I was so impressed with them that as my sugar glider family got larger, I bought more of these bottles.These bottles are a breeze to wash and keep clean, the fit is tight, and there is never an issue with leaking. The newer ""models"" of these water bottles now have little ""floats"" in them so that it is easy to see, at-a-glance, from across the room if the water level is low. They've taken a great bottle and made it even better! I have at least two water bottles on each of my cages as a back-up water supply.Check out KV Vet Supply - that's where I get my bottles. Price was very reasonable and shipping was super fast! I'd order from them again!"
134485,0,"Purchased 2 Emperor filters over a year ago for use on a 75 gallon koi aquarium. When I hooked them up, one only pumped half as much water as the other. I tried cleaning the unit and switching the impellers. This didn't help. The media containers were hard to fill and it seemed that most of the water would bypass the media. The cartridges clogged quickly due to the heavy amount of waste. I replaced cartridges and media container with 1"" thick foam. This lasts forever. The bio wheels seemed like a waste. The spray bar clogged easily and was hard to clean. Didn't seem like much water went thru the spray bar, even when it was clean. There does not seem to be much media surface on the wheels. Intake tube extension kept getting knocked off, so I took it off. The slower unit didn't move enough water, so I trashed it. The remaining unit is a quiet workhorse and does a great job. I replaced the slow unit with an Aqueon 55, which does a good job, although does not hold as much foam media."

After just a few days of Cosequin, she was racing around and climbing her condo like she was 2 years old. She even dug old toys out of her basket to play with. She coughed up a hairball the other day, which means she's grooming the dreadlocks out all by herself now. I was worried from other reviews that she wouldn't eat it, but she actually seems to like it and licks her bowl clean. The price is right, especially now that I can reduce her dosage to every other day. Win!"
108312,2,"Put in the battery, turn it onto the highest setting. The red light blinks, but nothing happened in the way of static shocks.I have used non-transparent scatmats several years ago, which worked just fine, so this was disappointing.I left it turned on, using the battery. One morning it was making popping noises and I could feel a shock when I touched it. And my cat apparently felt a shock a bit later, I saw him running out of the room. But later the popping noises stopped, and then it stopped working again.The AC adapter finally arrived, I plug it in, the red light blinks, but there are no static shocks. One of my cats is walking all over it right now without feeling any shocks.By the way, the ""Scat Mat"" label can be peeled off, revealing another label saying ""Pet Safe"".I will try to return this product as defective."

114988,0,"I've had the Boss Pet - Prestige 100ft Skyline Trolly for a few months now. The configuration is as follows; 2 corner posts 90ft apart, 10ft on either side of the line clear and a 50lb dog attached. The pulley wheel is plastic which has worn almost completely through to the point where it just drags instead of roles. All the metal clamps are rusted and one of the switches is broken. The line itself is pretty much intact and the screw hooks have held up nicely. Plan to replace all other parts though. Also, to prevent your pet from wrapping around each end post/tree you'll want to buy additional wire clamps to use as line stops."

210683,1,"After reading some of the negative reviews on this item describing this fishbowl is an inhumane habitat for a beta, I just gotta say nonsense! I've had the same beta on my desk for almost 5 years in one of those little beta bowls you get at the pet store. He is a great fish and seems to be happy. He doesn't complain about anything and actually is always happy to see me after the weekend. He is a beauty with long flowing fins and tail, has a good appetite and gets a water change every Friday before I leave. This wall mounted bowl is about 4X the amount of water that Old Blue lives in and the new resident of the wall mounted bowl"" Whalie"" seems happy! I'd like to add that the beta that I had in a well cycled 29 gallon tank with top of the line filtration died in a week. Go figure!"

The bad is it isn't the same as the one I bought 15 years ago from them and still works.The rubber bumpers on the ends that should help keep it up can't. The metal rails that slide the two gates back and forth come off track and bend easily.Plus this is one of those items that if you don't return it quickly as in 5 days, you can't."
23048,0,"This brush takes off a TON of fur, but after the first time using it I wondered whether it does so not because it's getting to the ""undercoat,"" but rather, that it's just cutting away at the outside layer -- similar to how some salons will thin human hair by running a razor blade down it.I tested this theory with an experiment. I took a length of ordinary thread and ran it past the teeth of the Furminator. The thread immediately snapped, cut in two by the razor-edge.Despite this blunt proof of somewhat misleading advertising, the Furminator *is* a satisfying tool... if you don't mind being satisfied by having a leaner cat after a couple of strokes! On one hand, it does get rid of excess fur simply because it's like giving the kitty a quick (and admittedly even) haircut; but on the other, maybe a haircut isn't what we're thinking of when we want to minimize normal shedding?"

11242,0,"We got this to try to track down urine smell on our carpet. When you shine it on the carpet some spots show up as ""yellow"" which I assume means that the urine is supposed to be there (although this is hard to know since it doesn't come with any useful directions). However, we couldn't smell urine in those places. So even though it seemed to find something, I'm not really sure how useful it was in getting at the smell since we couldn't smell anything in those places. That said, it also did show yellow at the places where we knew there to be urine, so it works some, but it wasn't really useful to us."

And this thing stinks up my house from time to time. It will pulvarize the feces instead of scooping it up. then when it hits the drying cycle, my whole house will smell like shampooed s---. Im not kidding, it is nausating. when i called catgenie, they told me that there is nothing they can do about that, and suggested i change my cats diet to a food that will make thier feces harder, so it wont be pulvarized. from what i can tell, thier feces is normal now, plus, the machine worked fine for the first 2 months, and my cats have been on the same diet for the last 3 years. catgenie's customer service is great until that 90 day return period is up, then its almost like you are flagged in thier system or something. They are less willing to help. i still prefer this over daily scooping of my old box, but for the price i paid ($350 for the tuxedo) i would expect to NOT have to do the amount of maintence to it that i have to do. now i dont spend my time scooping daily, but now spend it figuring out whats causing the error code, and airing out the house. oh, and those granules stick to the cats feet and are tracked all over the house."
3671,0,"my puppy loves this toy, but that seems to be the case when dogs can easily gut them. My mistake for having a toy that has stuffing.

The ropes are solid and she likes to flop it around. Strictly for outdoors at my house though."
216176,0,M was too small on my 30lb dog. It was cute. Dog hated it. I wish the hood was a bit more structured because it would not stay up.
141616,0,"There's nothing wrong with the mat. It arrived quickly, just as pictured, but my cats did not like it. I don't know if it really is ""warming"" (seems like an ordinary padded mat), but it does rustle, and my cats didn't seem to appreciate it. Yours could like it though--not all cats like the same things. Will try again with an enclosed cat bed."
162799,0,"I got this for my 3 month old Golden Retriever because I did not want to be giving her rawhides from walmart that can come from dead decomposing animals and really not be good for your pet. I was very pleased with the size and how tightly it is rolled. We have had it for almost a month now and you can barely tell the thing has been chewed on. Maybe the reason for this is that our dog does not seem to be to interested. She will chew on a small dingo from Walgreens until it is gone, but will only chew on this for minutes at a time. I am thinking that maybe she is not in love with it because of the fact that it is so big in comparison to her still puppy mouth and teeth. So all in all, the jury is still out on this one in my mind, I will update review in a couple months, but people will smaller dogs may want to look elsewhere."

I give him a few pieces on the floor, put the rest in the ball and roll it away- which gives his 'sister' time to eat her treats unmolested. I don't make the holes too small however because he'll give up too quickly. The little dude wants results without too much effort or he'll abandon it."

87836,0,"We have three cats and a small dog. I hoped that this pet fountain would help keep clean water available for a longer time and that the pets would enjoy drinking from the stream. We only had moderate success with those issues. On the downside, the motor was noisier than I thought and the running water noise was not the pleasant ""water feature"" sound I expected. No matter how we adjusted the flow it sounded like water being poured into a bowl of water.Pros:The fountain doesn't have to be cleaned every day like the old water dish.Two of our cats did enjoy drinking from the running water.The water is not stagnant, so it is aerated more and I expect it is cooler than from a dish.Cons:Still have to clean the unit more than once a week with the animals we have. A water dish is pretty easy to stick in the dishwasher or wash by hand and you're done. Cleaning the Drinkwell is quite a chore and has to be done more often then I thought it would need.It gets more hair and debris the bowl then I expected - and the pump and water flow doesn't keep it sucked up and filtered out. Much of it just sits at the bottom of the bowl.Our dog wanted nothing to do with it, so we had to leave a water bowl out for her. One of the other cats preferred using the dog's water dish. Only two of the cats took to the fountain (and they sometimes would use both).Noisy water pump - not super loud but still loud enough to be annoying. You do tend to tune it out, but I expected no more than just an electric hum.Once, the water grate clogged and caused the bowl to overflow until almost all the resevoir was empty. Good thing we have vinyl floors!Inital cost is pretty expensive. I did save quite a bit by buying it on Amazon rather than at the local Pet store.Replacement resevoirs, which they recommend to be replaced often, are not cheap!Overall I think it performs as claimed. Perhaps my expectations were too high."
105945,0,My friend's dog loved it and I don't think she had any problems but my dog had diarrhea after I gave him 4 in one day. I bought the salmon flavor. It smells bad (to me) but the dogs seem to like how it smells.
18725,2,"I bought this for my Cairn terrier for a stocking stuffer for christmas, it just showed up and I am shocked at its size. This toy is smaller then cat toys I have purchased! I am almost afraid to give it to her in fear or her swallowing it because it is that small. I would have expected this from the extra small size but not the small, but thats what I get for not reading the detail product dimensions. All in all, this toy is worth maybe $0.25 at best! It states that this is for dogs between 10-25 pounds, I would say it is for 10lbs and under and even that is pushing it."

Expensive leash that does not last long before knots appear and you have to manually stop your dog or hold the button down to stop the leash from extending."
155213,1,"My cat will be 16 years old this year. She suddenly started losing weight and acting ill about four years ago after one of my other cats died. I took her to the vet and was told that her liver was failing and there's nothing that could be done. While shopping at a local grocery store a couple years ago, I stumbled upon Cat Sure in a bargain bin for $1 a can. I bought a couple of cans even though they had many just to try it out. I was desperate at that point to try anything since nothing else worked. Within two days, my cat showed MAJOR improvement. She had her spunk back. Well, I ran out of Cat Sure and she settled back into not feeling very well until recently when I ordered this product from Amazon/KV Vet Supply. I have been giving it to her daily twice a day since last week. She is loving it. I was having a problem with her having diarrhea and throwing up also everyday all day (before giving her the supplement). As a result, I have had to keep her confined to the kitchen. Cat Sure has gotten rid of her diarrhea and has almost kept her from throwing up. My goal is to have her keep food in her belly so that I can have her come out of the kitchen and lead a normal cat's life again. KV Vet Supply has the lowest price that I have seen for this. I have seen it elsewhere recently for $8. It's worth it, but I would rather get two for the price of one here.If your cat is ill, don't hesitate taking them to the vet, but if the vet says there's nothing they can do...don't give up! Try this stuff!!"
108521,1,This product has saved our sofa. We bought too small (our mistake as they do have longer mats as well) so we added on with their extensions and these have worked perfectly. It only took one time and our dog has never chewed on the furniture again. I definitely recommend this product.
133249,0,"I bought this because I have 4 dogs to give to at Christmas. They love the bones, so that's good, but two are as shown in the picture, and two were placed next to each other in such a way that they were the size of the two larger ones. In other words, two were large and two were skinny. At first, I thought they'd sent only 3, but then when i opened the package I found the two small ones. Disappointing for the price. I buy the large ones at Petsmart but wouldn't have gotten my dogs the small ones if I'd known."
36392,2,"My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry. Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet. She was always begging for it, every 4 hours. And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size! I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl. But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure! Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago. It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us. I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night. Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food. She goes nuts, literally. She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed. Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet. On strictly Evo and wet food our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

154525,0,"The litter is made of silica crystals. These absorb the urine and dry out the poo which is then easily shoveled into the auto closing receptacle at the end of the unit. The problem is if it's summer and you don't have AC, the crystals aren't going to work. It's going to stink really bad.My main issue with this however is the litter. This type of litter isn't comfortable for the cats- in fact, for some cats with sensitive paws it can be painful. Our cat hated using it and whined every time. We got a regular clay litter box next to it and he immediately started using that and never went back to this one. No more whining. No more sore paws.Other than that, it worked as advertised."
67483,1,"This is a great window perch. Don't pay full price for it, but at just over $20 it's a good buy. Very easy assembly, no holes in the walls or sill required. Very stable. My cat loves it, massaging it with his paws sometimes. He jumps up on it from the floor, no problem. I like that it's not sticking out into the room to far, but because it's wide kittie has space to stretch out and lounge. I can definitely recommend it. In fact, I'm ordering a second one and just regret that I didn't get two right away."

We have a Chihuahua, and they seem perfect for the little guy, but he is still afraid to trust and use them. I think once he trusts using the stairs instead of jumping up on our setee, he will be happy with the stairs. They seem VERY sturdy especially for small dogs. The ONLY problem I found with them is the self adhesive non-skid pads you are given to apply to the stairs feet do not stick very well, which really surprised me. I made sure the surfaces were clean and stuck them on; they seemed to stick well, but we noticed the rubber pads would somehow get unglued from the bottom of the stairs. If not for the feet, I would rate them 5 stars, but maybe I am being too critical? I am happy I bought themSolvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs, especially from Amazon.comWell, a couple of months later, my Chihuahua still does not trust these stairs, and does not use them at all, sorry to say, so I took another star off, now making it a 3 star rating. I think the 2 main reasons he does not use these stairs is that they still slide around on the (ceramic tile)floor, and that the steps are not deep enough."

76468,1,"I have to start by saying I received this in a soaking wet box on my doorstep in a post office's box and was really upset. I contacted the company and they were quick to apologize and send me a new one right away. I have a problem with my older female dog peeing in my girls room in the same spot. I have tried different store brands of odor remover, baking soda, vinegar, completely saturating the carpet and cleaning it with everything imaginable with no success. This has seemed to work so far. The odor is out of the room as far as I can tell our dog hasn't peed there again. Our cat likes to pee on the floor in the bathroom if we leave a bath mat down and I've washed it, bleached it out in the sun and she still does it. I've used this in the laundry to wash the mat and again, so far so good. The product doesn't have a strong smell either, so as an odor remover it works great. I have a potty training daughter that had a poop accident in the living room while she was with the babysitter, so I didn't really tackle the stain until the next morning when I saw the spots and it didn't really seem to work at all for that. I've tried it a few times and finally used Spot Shot on the stain and that worked. I'm still happy with the product because it was the pet accidents that were driving me crazy."

It has been well used in the 18 months that we have had it, from weekly trips to Pets at Home, vet visits and even the local carnival, which saw us take 1st place. Hetty didn't like travelling in a pet carrier either so had to purchase another stroller for her since Felix wouldn't share his. She already loves it. Both strollers fit in the boot of my car, although there is no room for shopping, but I only have a Ford KA. I would highly recommend these strollers. They are great for cats that like to go out and are too heavy for a normal pet carrier. Felix and Hetty both love the attention they get while out in theirs!"

I wanted a snack for easy training and I would put them in my pocket for outdoor training, and like I said the puppy did eat them but didn't seem crazy for them.

20641,0,"Hi. I just wanted to point out two things about these chews. First of all, they are made in Mexico not the USA. Therefore, the ingredient list is misleading when it says ""American"" beef hide because it is meant to make you think that the beef hide is from the United States of America. More accurately, it should read, ""North American"" beef hide to distinquish it from being from Asia (note, the label does not specify the origin of the hydrolysed vegetable protein which could be wheat gluten). Secondly, these chews do not contain chlorhexidine like the ""C.E.T"" brand and this may be an ingredient you want if your dog has peridontal issues. My dogs like these chews and I think they do help to a small extent to clean the teeth. gb"
95653,1,"I bought this for my neighbor because she liked ours. I love ours, but have the small one. The large one is not as manueverable in tight spots like between plants, but then if you don't want to have to dump the bucket thing every 2 loads you pick up, then the large will work out better for you. Or if you have more than one dog or don't pick up daily. It's much bigger so it will save you from having to go to the trash can to empety every 2 loads like the small one. I love it and for the price, it's not worth trying to make my own. Sturdy construction, light weight, and so much better than using a shovel... especially on grass, bark or rocks. Now that I have had this thing, I wouldn't even consider using a shovel again. Neighbor loves it too (3 large dogs so I got her the large one).I got the spade though, for ours and the one for the neighbor. I see that there is a rake available, but I don't think I would like the rake. My dogs get loose stool often and the rake seems like it would make more of a mess. The spade is the way to go in my opinion.2 labs. They eat everything then leave the loads on grass, bark, leaves, gravel, and rocks. Solid surfaces not a problem for this thing either."
98615,0,"Some background info about my pup: She tugs and pulls everywhere we go. It's like she doesn't even recognize me at the other end of the leash while at home she listens to everything I say. Sometimes she likes to make my life harder when she hops 4-5 ft instead of walking. She is a 45 lb labrador/hunting hound mix. When she sees squirrels, she gets into hunting position with her body low against the ground and walks like a lion about to catch its prey. She goes from an angle where the squirrel cannot see her. When she is 5 ft from the squirrel she will make such a prounce that it feels like my arm has been almost ripped out if I'm not careful. I still love her though.About the Product: This leash has done the job for casual walks. I will NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of retractable leash if I know we will be in an area where I want her to be close, controlled and safe next to me. I just don't trust my pup too far away on a thin leash like this (even if it is all belted) with her hyperactivity and strength. Any moving object will make her go crazy and she can EASILY snap a leash like this especially if she is 16 ft out since I have less control the farther she is. I use it only on night walks when I know there are not many squirrels or distracting things outside. She has her freedom to walk a little bit more on the grass and go to the bathroom. Other than that, for her exercise I will take her to a dog park, baseball field or by the waterfront near me on a sturdy 6 ft leash where I run along with her.I would recommend retractable leashes for small dogs (yorkies, chihuahuas, malteses, etc.) I would not recommend retractable leashes for hyper dogs (of any size really other than toy size) or large dogs especially if it's somewhere risky or not safe. This leash is great for casual walks where you want your dog to have some bit of freedom."
128762,0,This is a good concept. My dog learnt how to pull them out quickly and loved it.But 2 days later I found out that he teared the top open so no more hiding things. Do not buy this if your dog is a chewer.
70140,1,"I bought this to connect my hamsters cage to a new cage so he would have more room. This is a sturdy tube and it also can be good for a toy. The image does not match the one you will get (but I mean this in a good way) because I got the Value pack #1 but it had more then the image shown! Also it had a 3 way tube so you can add on or add a toy (included air bubble, very fun!) I recommend this, for any Superpet Crittertrail cage! This is good for mice, hamsters, dwarf hamsters, and gerbils. They are easy to clean because you can take them apart. and it has alot of air holes so your little one can breath! Also it comes with these lock on things. So if you feel the tube is wobbly or not strong enough you can attach that. It also works if you have the same tube and you can't connect them this will make it work and easier! Great price too!!!!!"

159668,1,"This is a must-have complement to an all-in-one kit, such as API's master test kit. Much easier to use than it may first appear-- the most challenging part is handling the sensors, which tend to stick to the metal forceps (static-- wetting the forceps helps). The free ammonia assay is as simple as pipetting 1 mL of sample into a well (label the dish with a permanent Sharpie) and dropping in a sensor. Total ammonia involves one additional step before adding the sensor (add the total ammonia reagent).A properly controlled assay for free and total ammonia requires at least four wells, since you want to control for your conditioned tap water (or whatever source you use). Since each run takes at least 15 minutes, you might as well use wells 5-6 for additional tests (the positive total ammonia control and perhaps a straight/unconditioned tap water test).Once finished, get a small bowl/cup full of clean water and drop the sensors in to rinse them. Then, pick them out and put them back in the container to dry, and they should return to their original yellow color overnight, even if you close the container lid.A few other tips:1. Keep a cup/bowl of clean water close by to rinse your forceps.2. The sensors can be tricky to handle, so place them by the side of the well(s) and use a wooden toothpick to push them in; this ensures the reactions start at essentially the same time.3. Take a picture with the scale, all on a white background with homogeneous lighting. You can then use Image J or Photoshop/similar program to semi-quantitate values, rather than eyeballing them.4. Get a pair of quality forceps. Wiha has many offerings-- makes a huge difference in handling the sensors."

I use the buzzer now more then the shock button (he's getting smarter). But I'm always careful when I use the shock button because it gets stuck and continuously shocks my dog until I finesse the button back to its normal position. Also, he's getting the wrong message of why I'm disciplining him when I shock him. That's my fault though. I should have educated myself before I started training."

We unpluged the dumb thing and it sits in a closet!"
17934,0,"This collar worked really well and did stop our dog's barking for about a day... then the battery went dead. So I bought another and it worked for a few minutes, then I thought perhaps the battery was dead; so I bought another brand new battery and to my suprise, the unit is just not working at all. So, if you can get a unit that works, it works well and is a humane alternative to a shock collar. I'll have to send mine back and hopefully get one that works.August 2009: I wanted to give an update since my last review. I ended up sending the unit back to the company and they promptly sent me a brand new collar (the original was defective). Although it still does use batteries up quite quickly, it did the job on our dog's barking. Now I don't even need to turn it on and he remains quiet.The customer service was very, very good...so if you get a defective collar, call the company and they'll quickly and pleasantly make it right! They even sent doggie treats in the box with the new collar!"
106922,0,"The pad fit our Dogloo perfectly. It was ample in padding. However, it lasted less than one hour. The pad was for our older dogs who are somewhat sedate. We have a one year old cattle dog who got into the pen and summarily destroyed the pad by digging at it. I did not catch her in time to limit the damage. So, if you have a digger/chewer this pad is not the one for you."
113222,2,"I rarely leave reviews but feel that I need to for this product. It just arrived in the mail and my dog has been playing with it for about 15 minutes. Initially, it was great. It was perfect to throw and she was having a blast chasing it. I left her alone for about 10 and was just forced to put it away as there is now green rubber peices all over the floor. Given, my dog is definitely a chewer but I expected it to last longer than 15 minutes. Would not purchase again."

93211,0,"I bought this recently with good hopes it will be a nice fit with my new puppy (3 months). Anyway, I thought it did ok except when I would attach it to my puppy's collar. The clasp is too small, there's not a lot of heft in it and when I tried to clip it on my puppy's collar (and with my puppy squirming and turning his head every time), it would not clasp easily. So, even though the leash is good as far as standing up to the chewing, I have a problem with the clasp. It needs to be bigger and more substantial. I have since gotten another leash."

113218,2,"I was really excited about this toy since my 5 month old puppy loves sticks. I also liked that it was hollow so I could put treats or peanut butter inside. However, it lasted 5-15 minutes with him before he was easily able to start ripping rubber off at the ends and eating it. We had to take it away from him and throw it out. It's pretty unacceptable to me that a 5 month old puppy was able to rip this up in minutes. I guess it might be good if your dog NEVER chews and only fetches, but otherwise steer clear."
162693,1,We were using a blanket to cover the crate and also had a thin mat in the crate. Our dog Sandy would sleep in it at night but would never go into it on her own during the day. As soon as I finished putting the cover on and adding the new mattress she was in it lying down. Now she will go into her crate and sleep during the day. I don't know what it is but she loves it and it looks great and gets rid of the messy blanket look. It also washes really well.
9801,1,"With no shortage of Biological water treatments available - I've never really relied on them. The reason being is there's no true shortcut to a fully cycled aquarium - you have to wait and let nature take it's course. In the past I've tried products like Cycle by Nutrafin and Easy start by Tetra but in most cases these products were used in setting up fast quarantine and hospital tanks.Most of these products - want you to use them continuously which doesn't make sense. If you have a fully cycled tank why would keep adding new strains of bacteria to already established water? Well, I think because some manufacturers want you too keep coming back for more and the price of admission isn't cheap.Cycle at around $22 for 16 ounces encourages you to dose your tank with 5 ml for every ten gallons once a week - and 10 ml for every ten gallons during water changes.Nonsense.This brings me to ""Stability"" by Seachem (one of my favorite companies)But being partial to them and their product line doesn't mean I don't question or research as best I can. That said, I'm nursing a new 55, a 40 and 125. I had a bottle of Stability which I had bought on a what the heck basis - the 55 has fish in it, I seeded the filter but still had serious ammonia spikes.The bacteria used in competitive products are inherently unstable. And for the bacteria to survive it must live in the exact temperature, PH and other water parameters in which it was raised and colonized. When you add this bacteria to your aquarium, it survives for a brief while - but then crashes and dies.Stability on the other hand, has bacteria that can survive in almost any kind of water - fresh and salt and virtually any type of water conditions. Seachem states the strain took a decade to develop. What sets it further apart from the competition is that it contains nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria which isn't the case for any other product of it's kind. Seachem also states - other bacterial supplements form toxic hydrogen sulfide - something that can never happen with Stability.With this said, I've dosed my new tanks according to the directions which are 5 ml per 10 gallons on the first dose and a follow up of 5 ml per 20 gallons for 7 days. What I've noticed - and noticed quickly, is that my water is clearly more stabilized. Currently I show no ammonia on the API test or Seachem Ammonia Alert meter - it's been five days since the last dose and all of my readings are in the safe zone.I don't use it for water changes - but having experienced the problems of adding fish to a non or partially cycled tank, I have not so fond memories of daily 50% -80% water changes for weeks..ugh.Where Stability shines is in helping you protect your fish and stabilize the water, especially in keeping the primary fish killer -ammonia in check.So for specific applications Stability is an excellent product. It's harmless to fish and appears to deliver on it's promise. But as a weekly or even monthly addition to established tank maintenance I wouldn't suggest it.To their Credit, Seachem says you can use it as an on going additive - but unlike other products they don't make it sound like you have to."

27426,2,"I have three small dogs, two of which are problem barkers. The problem is that the collar isn't very good at detecting a bark. The packaging states that it isn't supposed to shock them for every bark, which makes plenty of sense, but the problem is that it almost never ""fires"" at all.It partly works on our Jack Russel, which has a relatively deep-toned bark. When he wears the collar he does reduce his barking after it shocks him a few times, but mostly he changes how he barks in a way that doesn't set off the collar.On our Chihuahua, which is the worst barker, it apparently can't detect his annoying high-pitched yapping at all. I have never seen it actually shock him. I suppose I'll switch to a remote control system.I was surprised at how poorly this works -- the PetSafe invisible fence products are great (although they're all insanely overpriced and the one company has bought up all the others to completely control the market)."

This has happened to others too I noticed after reading the reviews and thought it won't happen to me, but it did. So, item is good but Amazon is horrible for checking their items before they ship them. Returning would have been a real 'pita' and I didn't want to chance yet another item without hardware. I recommend this product but I highly recommend you purchase it elsewhere!"

I put this thing down filled with their toys & within 1 minute (possibly less) they had all of their toys out of it & were not interested. So, on the one hand, they seem to like the 1-2 minutes of &#34;hunting&#34; to get the toys out, however it's not an extended time of play."

115068,2,Sadly these balls are not tough at all. I had them only a week before they were shredded. My dog only played with the balls at the beach.

I will not purchase them again.

198761,2,"I purchased this item thinking that it had 6 ports as shown in the product information picture. It came with only 4 ports which was stated in the information section so I guess I should have checked all the information more closely. I guess I was fooled. The feeder is very small and will not last for more than a half day with all the Hummingbirds that come to visit me. So far (after one week) there has been little interest in the feeder, perhaps because I am using the insect guards. I have asked Amazon.com what to do about the confusion regarding the number of ports and I am waiting their reply. If you have a lot of Hummingbirds, I do not recommend this feeder, purchase something with a larger volume."
88330,2,"This fountain has been just okay. I've had it for 3 years and have never had any problems with the functionality.I have one cat who drinks regularly from the waterfall and the basin. He seems to be very happy with it. It alsomakes a relaxing trickling waterfall sound that I think is very peaceful.Here's what I don't like and feel might harm my kitty: It's plastic and gets lots of buildup and slime. The hardwater build up is impossible to remove. I've scrubbed, I've run thru the dishwasher 3x in a row, I've soaked in CLR,nothing removes the scaling. And it's always slimy - YUCK! Every time I clean it (1-2x a week) it's got slimeon the plastic walls. I feel so terrible that my kitty is drinking nasty bacteria ridden water.The BPA in plastic is harmful to pets (and us) and plastic scratches, harboring harmful bacteria.Ceramic resists bacteria growth because the surface is non-porous unlike plastic.I came across this pet fountain: Pioneer Ceramic Drinking Fountain Big Max.Ordered it and should get it any day now. Just hope my kitty likes it!If you're going to get a pet fountain, get a ceramic one and don't risk your pets' health.If you're looking for something better looking than all these mass produced fountains here's an Etsy shop withsome really cool, unique ones: [...]Too expensive for me but they're pretty."

35180,2,"I cannot recommend this gate to anyone under any circumstances. It is extremely flimsy and shoddy in construction and would not bar a child or dog from entering a room.Furthermore, although the description is technically accurate, unless your doorways are PERFECTLY square, the gate will not adjust at all. Therefore, get out a carpenter's square before you order. And I do mean perfectly square. If your house is as much as 1/64 inch out of square, either the upper or lower knob that supposedly holds the gate in place will not fit tightly enough to keep the gate in place. It is by no means as adjustable as the product description. If you have an older house, definitely give this product a pass.Oh, and by the way! Be sure that you can return the gate THE DAY BEFORE YOU GET IT for a full refund. Yes, that is right.

Looks good in theory but, have you ever tried to hold a cat with one hand and arm, open its mouth with the other &#34;unprotected&#34; hand, then &#34;gracefully&#34; shove that blue end down its throat to cure what ails him or her???? NO??? Then I wouldn't bother. I tried it twice (glutten for punishment) and I got the same treatment both times. From both normally &#34;docile&#34; cats. They don't like it! PERIOD! I didn't like it or the results I physically received either. What I did afterwards is, and after applying about a quart of iodine to my wounds, I crushed the little pills up, got a tablespoon of the cat food they're used to and mixed it al together. I waited 'til I knew they were quite hungry and wadded it all together, put it in their cat food bowl and, guess what.............THEY ATE IT ALL UP!

So, we sprinkled a bit on the cat food and the dog food (sometimes they share anyhow - they seem to be very curious about what we feed the other animal). Neither one, though, did more than nibble at their food. They didn't seem that interested. We use crunchy bits for both of them, and maybe things would be different if we mixed it in with a wet food, but ... I'm not going to change food brands from what they seem to like for this.

117587,1,"I needed a swinging gate to keep my dogs in the utility room when I need to confine them. I had been using a pressure gate so that I had to remove the entire gate to get through the doorway. This was difficult when carrying groceries or laundry. I bought this swinging gate, and the delivery was amazing because I had the gate in 2 days. Setting up the gate was easy and we use it numerous times every day. The only thing that would make it absolutely perfect would be if it had rubber bumpers at the bottom that could accomodate curved molding along the floor. Because I have curved molding, I have two choices: remove the molding and leave my doorway looking unfinished OR put the gate in place above the molding which does create a small trip hazard since the horizontal bar which should be flush to the floor has to be 2"" off the floor to be above the top of the curved molding."

88841,0,"After having the original drinkwell fountain for 6+ years, the plastic was becoming brittle and the surface had discolored. Even though the pump was still running strong, it was time to get a new one. I brought home the Platinum. The new Platinum is easier to take apart and no more busting knuckles trying to remove the pump. Just pull off the top and there the pump is, easy peasy to pop out. However, the corners, nooks and crevices that are hard to reach and clean still exist, and the water reservoir has been redesigned too. rather than have a normal designed jar with a wide mouth lid that you can pull off and easily wash with a bottle brush, it's now ""ergonomically"" designed to be almost d@mned impossible to get clean thoroughly. I don't want to put it in the dishwasher, because I'm afraid it'll damage it. The rest of the fountain - minus the pump, goes in the dishwasher to clean. That is absolutely the only way to clean every stupid nook and cranny. I really hope the manufacturer reads this review and corrects the still very serious design flaws, the inability to really clean every part of the fountain.The fountain works great, I don't have any issues with vibration or noise, except when the water level is low. Then the noise lets me know I need to add water. I really forget about it otherwise.I love the new filters, it does keep the fountain cleaner longer. I ran out of the new filters and still had a few of the old ones left over from the Original Drinkwell and figured a filter is a filter. Wrong. The old filter just wasn't up to the task, The water was nasty in 3 weeks time. Had disassemble it and run it thru the dishwasher, it was that gross."

123589,1,"I bought this at a local pet store although the Amazon price was a little better. I needed a sisal scratcher ASAP! I really like the look of quality of this product. As more than one other reviewer mentioned, it actually has aesthetic appeal; and both of my rescue cats (one with claws, one declawed) love it. My only recommendation would be to observe your cat's scratching tendencies before buying. Our little girl with claws, Posie, kept working the carpet, so I was fairly certain she would take to it. And she did! (I'm sure the catnip I rubbed on it didn't hurt either.) And the rubber feet keep the board locked in place on hardwood, tile, and carpet alike. Great product!"
127577,0,"This is a very cute toy and my dog instantly took to it, however, it didn't last 24 hours with my 10 month golden retriever. She had the legs torn off and the stuffing and sqeakers out within a day. She loves to chew and the fabric isn't strong enough for a heavy chewer. I also bought the intellibone plush toy and she hasn't destroyed that yet, I think because the fabric is more durable. Puzzle Pup is a great toy for the dog who doesn't like to take things apart!!"
176632,2,"Does not work for more then an hour or soHad to keep trying to give more and more to my cat after surgery, she kept waking up trying to pull out the stitchesI would not recommend this product"
130151,1,"Purchased this product based on the brand name, customer reviews and the need to transport our cat from NH to NM via car with room inside for him to stretch, place for disposable litter box, toys and blankets. Can be easily disassembled for easy storage between uses. Rear and side vents allowed for air circulation and sunlight to overcome the stress of such a long trip."
88570,0,"The problem with this product as far as I am concerned is that there isn't an easy way to pick it up from the floor when it is full of water and needs to be cleaned. No ridges on the sides or handles. You have to try to ease your fingers under the bottom of the dish in order to lift it. Don't like that about it. Also don't like that when you refill the water container and turn it right side up, there is water loss from the bottom onto the floor. I wish the stainless steel 360 had been out when I bought this. I hope that it will prove to be a better product."
215231,2,"Sigh - I am now on my 8 month and 3rd Petmate fountain and have had the same issue with this fountain as I have had with the previous 2. The motor is running, but no water is coming out of the top. I have tried using with and without the filter, I have cleaned it once a week, I have even tried turning it off at regular intervals to see if it was because it was being over taxed, but nothing is helping. I am shortly going to be throwing this thing out and trying a Drinkwell.I only give it two stars instead of one because at least it looks nice in black."
109886,1,"He loves these treats! I put them into his various puzzle toys and they are small enough to come out when he pushes the toy around, but not too small that they pour out without any interaction on his part. We also use these treats in training our ""still puppy"" Alex (1y 6mo). He might be full sized, but he loves fun and games. These treats are an integral part of his daily fun."
216991,2,"I think this looks so much nicer in the picture than in real life. I bought this to give as a gift but will keep instead. It is really large and therefore takes away from the design. The copper coloring is overwhelming. I had bought because of value and free shipping, but would not recommend."
143860,1,"I have had aquariums for several years and this power filter is one of the best out there. It uses a three chamber system to clean and deoderize and keep aquariums freed up of any floating debris or nasty bug. There is the sponge which filters out any little nasties floating around in the water, there is a bag of charcoal to keep the water clean and free of ammonia build up, and there is a chamber for media which allows positive bacteria to grow and help build the invisible filter."
83933,0,"This is a great product it grows very pretty, very quickly, but my kitty was not very fond of it. Im not sure what it is, but she would rather eat the grass outside."
115709,2,"I have 2 of these filters, and have been running them for about 7 years now. I have to get a new one about every year or two because one or more of the seals ultimately fail. Honestly the only reason I continue to use them is because the folks at Marineland are great to work with. They have promptly sent me a replacement filter or filter head for FREE every time I've had a leak, which is about 4 times now."
65830,1,"We have just recently adopted a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. I wanted to make sure that she had the best nutrition available. After some research and consulting my vet, I decided on Lifes Abundance. Let me just say it is great for puppies. Our pup took to it right away and hasnt had any of the problems you might expect by switching food. I highly recommend this food. The kibble is a good size for all dogs and the taste must be good because she cant get enough. One tip: Once you've decided that this food is for you buy the 40lb bag. Shipping is the same whether you get the 8lb or the 40lb."
51543,0,Have been using the strips for month or two and they work ok for a quick reading. I have compared the results with another brand test strip and the API master test kit. The only one that is really off for me is the nitrate which keeps coming up bright pink or 200 and the real level is 20. Not sure why it keeps doing this except maybe since my tank water is so hard? Not sure. I have tried the strips in other samples of water including spring water and distilled water. And it seems to work fine with those samples. I think for most causal fish keepers the strips should work fine but remember the strips are not as good as the liquid tests. I probably will not be buying these again since I always have to double check the nitrate level to be sure it's not really off the charts.
158929,0,"I purchased this collar with recommendation from my trainer. My dog is passive aggressive and I have to be able to control his face when in public.I could never truly desensitize him to the gentle leader - He was CONSTANTLY rubbing his face against my legs or would lay on the ground and paw at his face, no matter how much work we put into getting him used to it. It got to the point where, during one trip to petsmart, he managed to scrape both of the corners of his eyes raw on my jeans. BE CAREFUL. I would never ever leave this device on any dog without supervision.Now. I don't feel this device is BAD. Dakota is a very unsocial dog, but very intelligent and trains well. I noticed that during the training sessions with the gentle leader, he was far more focused and seemed less distracted by the other dogs/people around. I don't know if it had to do with a 'defeated' attitude, or if he really was paying more attention to get the gentle leader off sooner, but that's how he acted.With this in mind - He can never wear his gentle leader and actually be comfortable. I use it strictly as a control device now (going around crowds, petstores, etc). He would never act like his happy hyper self with it on, so going on walks and playing at the park are reserved for his regular collar.In conclusion, I feel the gentle leader is good for some, not good for others. It really depends on the dog."
52987,2,"Bird feeder was delivered as advertised. Bird feeder was itself was not damaged, but there was a hole in the bottom of shipping carton. The the mounting pole was not in the box; it was probably lost through the hole. I intended to hang the the feeder, so the loss of the pole was inconsequental for me. I am pleased with the purchase."
176448,1,I absolutely love the Lupine products and this harness is the greatest ! Fits my dog well and is so cute. No pressure on the neck when walking. Would highly recommend that everyone use a harness like this for their dog and you will surely love the Lupine ones with all their pretty colors. Lupine collars and harnesses have wonderful snaps and are extremely well made. And with a guarantee that is unbelievable as it is good even if the harness is chewed.
30982,2,"In the description of this product it states that you can adjust the vibration of the unit. I wasn't aware that there are two different types of this product. The regular sonic one you have to activate the other is a vibration unit that you can adjust the vibration and leave the unit in the area to keep the animal away. I had bought this thinking it was the vibrating unit due to the description. I was going to go away for Christmas and wanted something to monitor our cat when he got too close to the Christmas tree. When the unit arrived, I checked the Amazon website again and then noticed there are two different units. I never picked up on it when I ordered. Bottom line, the description for the regular sonic unit is wrong and needs to be corrected. You are not able to adjust the vibration unit and leave it unattended. It's not worth for me to return this one for the other since I will be leaving in a few days for my trip. I'm really disappointed and annoyed that I was mislead."
211235,1,My little pup loves these stairs. She only weighs about 6 pounds and our bed is set up pretty high. The height of the stairs is perfect for her to run up on the bed. No longer are we picking her up and putting her down multiple times at night. Only took about 2 treats for her to get use to them. Easy!!
162213,0,"I bought both the bristle bone and this one, the bouncey bone. When I bought them I thought the high price was easy to justify. A toy that satisfies a chewing urge, smells yummy, and keeps my dog entertained sounded like a great thing. The pieces unscrew so you can reload the rawhide rings. My medium sized dog found it very easy to take it apart, and I found the pieces scattered while he chewed on it under my desk. It happened so quickly that when I discovered it, he had already started to destroy one of the purple rubber rings on the bristle bone. I wanted to prevent the disassembly trick, so I screwed the pieces together more tightly. Unfortunately the weak nylon piece broke off when I did that. There's about $20 down the drain. Maybe I should have stuck to Nylabones."
51147,1,"This is the answer to my prayers. I have a 29 Gal. and a 10 gal. and it takes me only 15 minutes to do water changes for BOTH of them. After all these years of hauling heavy buckets with a bad back, gagging on siphons, and not getting much mulm up through ordinary siphons, and having to mop my floor or soak up water from the carpet, I finally have something that can take care of my fish without ANY mess!I do recommend you practice on a bucket first though till you figure out how it works. I scared the scales off my fish switching it from suction to fill with a gigantic exploding air bubble. That was my fault though, not the product's. I also ended up with a nearly 50% change on my 10 gallon because it works SO fast.I totally recommend going with Pet Supply Outlet. They have the cheapest rates and I got my Python in a timely manner and in perfect condition."
131400,0,"Shipping time was excessive, taking about two weeks to receive from Little Family Members. The product arrived in good condition.I ordered the ""mega"" size as I hoped it would be too large for our three year old, black lab dog to fit entirely in his mouth so he wouldn't be able to chew on it as much between throws thereby lengthening the toy's lifespan. Tennis balls don't live very long and unfortunately the mega size didn't stay intact through day two. After only two play sessions, he managed to bust the seal of the two halves of the ball, though the external material has kept the two pieces connected. I was curious whether the mega size would also increase the throwing distance; it did not.In hindsight, now that a local WalMart is selling the regular tennis ball size Chuckit for a dollar cheaper than retailers on Amazon.com, I think I will just invest in that one and continue to buy regular tennis balls at three for a dollar.Despite the balls' short life span, the Chuckit launcher is a great way to enjoy the prey game with our dogs, saving us from 'slobbery ball syndrome'."
16345,0,"I only rate it a 3 cause I'm not sure it has worked to it's full potential.I bought so my rat would stop chewing on the things that aren't hers, I think it may have worked but I'm just not sure."
15311,2,"We have a VERY barky rat terrier. He goes absolutely bonkers for any squirrel or dove/ bird in the yard or in the trees around the yard. He will literally bark for like an hour incessantly if we let him. We got these collars at PetSmart and they are super effective until they BREAK. And they definitely break. We have been thru 2 in 3 years. They stopped working after about 6 months and we have just been using wishful thinking that they will start working again after much tinkering and battery changing. Also, the other reviewers who mention battery usage are right. These collars EAT batteries up and they are a total rip off since they make them so that you have to buy their brand. We had hoped that just having the collar on would be a deterrent, but our little guy is smart and figured out that he can bark to his heart's content when the battery is dead and also learned how to drain it. Since it has six progressive levels, he would sit and bark four times and let it reset then bark four more and let it reset... you get the idea. If you have a smart dog don't buy this collar. We are moving on to something else."
18562,0,"i really thought this birdie toy looked awesome, but my bird (green cheek conure) does not really pay attention to it. the vine rings clump together too much, even when toy is outstretched. he usualy loves bells, so much so that i purchase additional bells to add to toys, but he pays no attention to this one. i have introduced it 3 different times since april. i will try again to introduce it differently."

170408,0,pretty ugly. it does the job but it's NOT cute despite what other reviewers say.
27752,0,My puppy killed this in about 3 weeks. I was not not unhappy but expected it to be a little tougher carrying the Kong name. My puppy is a Cocker-poo so this was actually on the large side for him but it still died a horrible mangled dog toy death.
165551,1,My puppy loves these treats and they help her as she chews. Product arrived very quickly and it is a very good price.Thank you
47313,0,"My biggest complaint is it's instability. No matter how I seat belt it in, it wobbles. I think that might be what turned off my dog. He tried to perch his feet on the edge by the window, and it tumbled forward. He knocked his head on the window only to have the car seat fall forward against the dash. Since then he won't stayed in the seat. Too bad, since it wasn't cheap. On the flip side my cat likes it as a bed."
28552,0,We have Italian greyhounds that weigh between 13 - 21 Lbs. This bone is too big for them to carry.
55161,0,"My cats love this and I generally put treats in it before I leave town to distract them from my disappearance. The good thing about the ball is that the sliding chambers means that one can put a variety of different treats in the ball at different times so it never becomes rout. The bad thing about the ball is that it is virtually impossible to set the opening so that it isn't really easy for the cats to get the treats out of the ball. Really, all they have to do is tap it a bit. And if I move it any more closed, then no treats will ever come out -- and that's not fair! Still, it does its job, which is to entertain my boys."
179875,0,"I found this when my syrian outgrew her 7-in ball. While it works, it is quite strange that there are no sizes between 7-in and 10-in. She is not quite as skilled at steering it, nor as skilled at stopping... but she can still make it go and it does not scare her anymore since she got used to it (about a week). I forgot to tape the door several times, but it seems a bit sturdier and she has not popped it open yet."
84359,1,"This little battery-operated, counterintuitively-programmed pet feeder has given me my freedom. It works beautifully, providing 2 meals a day to my elderly, metabolically-challenged cat. I no longer worry he won't have food, and I no longer worry he will gorge himself. Truly, once you get it programmed (no small feat, I'll agree), it is a pleasure and a relief to own. Of course, I've only had it for two weeks, so stay tuned..."
167060,2,"This filter seemed like a good design at first glance. However, after running for only about 24 hrs it stopped working and we were unable to get it to start again. Therefore, it isn't worth buying at any price."

178456,2,"This box is a great idea, as our 16-year-old cat can't jump much anymore and was having trouble getting in and out of other boxes. But this box didn't work for her, mainly because she apparently thought that merely standing in the litter part of the box was sufficient. I won't get graphic--you can get the idea--liquids follow gravity."
90122,0,"We used this litter before I got pregnant. I used to be in charge of the kitty litter box and I scooped once a day. When I got pregnant, my husband took over and well.... he scooped twice a week. That's when I noticed that after more than 2 days the smell was just terrible. Even after the hubby scooped, the smell lingered. We decided to use Fresh Step kitty litter since then, and have no problem with smell anymore. I gave birth to my baby 3 months ago and well... now my husband scoops once a week....(helpless...)."
143967,2,This is the worst fish tank filter I have ever had. The first one I purchased from a pet store. It worked O.K. for a couple of months and then began to make noise. I returned this filter and ordered another one through Amazon. This one did not work at all. I returned it and ordered another just to have a different problem - it did not work either. I returned yet again and ordered another. This one did not even turn on. I am returning this one and going to an entirely different type/manufacturer.
143994,0,"I needed to upgrade to a larger power filter (I upgraded to a larger aquarium). I was using the Aquaclear 50. The Aquaclear 50 did a great job and it was very quiet. The Aquaclear 70 does a great job too, but it is very loud. Almost too loud. I can take the lid off and it helps, but the noise is coming from the filter motor. It is not a vibration noise. I already exchanged it for another one because I thought the loudness was a defect. I was wrong. If you have your aquarium in a family room where you spend alot of time, this power filter is too loud."

90340,1,"I wanted this thermometer to make sure I was in the ideal temp range for my betta's aquarium. Between hot summers and chilly winters, I wanted to be sure my heater was doing it's job AND there was appropriate cooling and AC in the room.I put the sticker on the outside bottom left corner of the front face of the 2.5gal tank. At first I was a bit worried the sticker was too big-looking but it looks great and I'm so used to it now! The temp is easy to read and seems to be accurate- it does reflect variation between 78 and 80 degrees, so it's not stuck or anything...Would definitely recommend. Esp at the price- maybe two if the tank is big or you need to remove and replace or something XP"
137484,0,"I thought KONG brand toys were less destructable. Our dog had it torn apart in the first hour. She had a great time doing it, but it didn't last long."
83956,1,I got this to see if my dog like this as well as he likes lawn grass and he did! It grew fast and was very easy however the base of the stems and soil got moldy after awhile I think because it is hard to water the right amount in the bag. At least it was for me. It is a nice idea though and it did work!
61848,2,"Do not but this product. It's flimsy, and easily breaks. It's not worth $15. It is a knock off of other bubble walls. If you are looking for a similar product then try the Fish Tank Aquarium Blue 14"" Bubble Wall Airstone w 3 Suction Cups. I own that one now, and it works like a charm. This Lee's product was a disapointment."

35785,0,"I purchased this collar for my strangely strong and headstrong Cocker Spaniel after having terrible luck with previous ones. He is 10 years old and always been impossible to walk (especially when other dogs are around). The Gentle Leader collar worked well, but was NOT gentle on my dog. It helped control him, but if he tried to go after another animal, he would pull so hard that it made his mouth bleed and his eyes would become swollen.I ended up going with the easy Walk Harness (same company, I think). It has been much better."
111634,0,My two golden retrievers like this ring but always pass it over for their wishbone shaped nylabone. It seems hard for them to manipulate it off the floor to get a grip on it. It looks like we'll have it for years - they are barely making teeth marks in it.

31541,2,"I have a cat that suddenly started peeing all over the house few months ago, mostly where the other cat likes to be, and after taking him to the vet he said it could be a health issue, or behavioral. He said we should try some changes in routine to see if it helps and rule out the behavior causing the misbehavior, but it just seems not to end... There is one more cat in the house, living together since last July, and the two do not really always agree. However peeing started pretty recently. After online research I decided that this plug in was some kind of the miracle products, since countless reviews were all wonderful ... I bought two of them and plugged in most ""endangered"" areas. Apparently it didn't help :( peeing didn't stop and the disagreements between kitties keep occurring from time to time. I need to go back to the vet since I cannot seem to find the solution to my problem. It is really overwhelming to live in a stinky house, tracking new spots, and constantly cleaning...I am not sure if my cat's behavior is caused by underlying health issue, and therefore I might not give enough credit to the product, but it doesn't work for me. Seems that the money I spent, were spent for nothing."
119584,1,"I can't say enough good about this product. Where do I start I have owned this litter box for 6 weeks now and wish I would have purchased it sooner. I previously owned 3 litter maid boxes and was always having to clean the rake, find out why the light was flashing, scoop because the clump was to big for the rake etc. Not the case with Scoopfree. I have 2 adult cats one 15 years old and one 6 years old. Both took to it the first day. The box is extremely quiet when it operates and there is virtually no odor. I did purchase the hood for the box as my cats were used to having a hood on the old littermaid. I change the cartridges about every 10 days. I was monitoring the box the first week or two and decided not to go the whole 2 weeks. The cost of the cartridges is not bad I pay $[...] for a box of (3) including shipping from a site on Amazon.com. I am sure I was spending almost that much on the premium litter for my littermaid and I had to babysit it all the time. Best of all it has a satisfaction guarantee printed right on the box. If it doesn't work out you are only out a litte time and shipping money. What more can you ask for."

46969,1,"This is a very durable toy. My dog, a cockapoo, has chewed through many, many toys over the yeras. A few years ago I found this toy at Fleet Farm in Milwaukee. I purchased 2 of these. They lasted about a year and a half. I recently went back to Fleet Farm to see if they had any more, but I could not find them. I them found them on Amazon. I ordered several. They come in a variety of bright colors. My dog carries it everywhere she goes and they are easy to see when she takes them outside in the yard."
182821,2,"We purchased this from Petco and recently donated it to a local shelter along with several cases of refills. We only used it for a month. We have 5 adult cats, 3 large males and 2 large females. Before we bought this unit we had 4 litter boxes, so we had high hopes that this would save us lots of scooping time. Not so!3 of our cats are over 16lbs and one of our adult males is diabetic so he urinates quite frequently. He also urinates a lot when he goes, leaving a huge clump, which the machine cannot handle. It gets all mashed up into the rake and clogs it. We spent more time cleaning this machine than we did scooping litter with the old boxes.There are several major design problems with this machine.1. Large cats do not fit well in it so they tend to do their business and exit quickly, leaving whatever they did on the surface thus quickly overwhelming the rake. The unit should be twice as big as it is.2. The rake clogs very easily if your cat(s) are large and urinate a lot. Also, the rake is plastic and can break easily.3. The litter has to be premium-clumping litter or forget it, it won't work.4. The waste container is way too small and fills up quickly (see next note).5. The refills are really expensive and if you go on the automatic delivery service you will wind up with way too many refills sitting on your shelf. Gee, I wonder why? Guess who's making a killing off the refills?In a nutshell, unless you have 1-2 small healthy cats that always bury their waste, forget it. You'll spend more time cleaning the rake and brushing out the rails/mechanism than you did scooping your old box. And you'll be paying more to do it."
20584,2,"I have four cats and only one of them liked this product. Unfortunately, she is not chewing the product, only batting it around. I would not purchase this product again and I would not tell a friend to buy it unless their cat is known to chew on things."
196452,0,I like this for the price. It worked well but I did have to cut the edges to get it to fit into the filter area of the tank...and it was a bear to cut. I bought more though--because of the price and how well it did work.

I will continue to keep him on this with the hope that I can stop the rymadyl and will update in a few weeks to let you know if I see any improvement. Also, he will not chew these so I break them up and put them in food.I also have put him on fish oil and glucosomine/condroitin pills.Update: I tried two bottles of it and never saw one bit of improvement so I discontinued. I wish it would of helped, those who think it does keep it up, I just never saw any change so I stopped."

152306,0,"I put in a cat fence last summer and training took approximately 3 weeks, after which I changed the batteries on both cat collars. Since then - 6 months ago - I've not had to change them again. Firstly, the cats only wear the collars when they go out - they don't have them on all the time. Secondly, I turn the collars off when they're not in use (that once-a-minute green flash takes a lot of battery-power over time). Thirdly, when I turn them back on, they frequently (about 60% of the time) seem to be dead because the red flash doesn't appear. But I've found that if you take the key and turn the battery pack all the way to the right (past the ""OFF"" position until the line is in the 3 o'clock position), wait ten seconds and then turn it back to the on position, it will typically start working again. Failing that, take the battery out and rub the contact points in the collar and put it back again. If I changed the batteries every time the lights didn't flash, I'd have changed them once a week. As it is, they've worked pretty well for me - and I know at least one of my cats frequently tests the boundaries!"

106649,2,"Not for dogs. The pads are the correct size but compared to most dog pads I've used these dont hold water. I have to use two layers of these pads where one of another brand would be sufficient. Understandably, these werent designed for pets and them directing their water host in one spot. Thats typically where it leaks through. I'm sure these would work for bed wetting, where the liquid is more distributed. Lesson learned, yet again, you get what you pay for."
137503,0,I got this for my dog and the good news is that he loved it. But he's a strong chewer and it didn't last more than a day or so. I can report that several other off brands make similar versions which have lasted weeks in our household.

83359,1,"We have 3 70-pound retrievers and for the most part, they are very good in their crates. We use the crates whenever we are not at home and sometimes at night (though for the most part, tghey have graduated to sleeping in our rooms). However, if they hear you in the house and they have not been let out or they do not agree with your decision that it is time to be in the crate, they will jump and claw and paw to try to get out.Midwest Life Stages was the only crate that I have found that will stand up to your dog regardless of size. It is one thing to survive a little puppy who is all full of themselves... however, when you have a crate that can stand strong in the face of 70 pounds of fur and muscle, you have a great crate.I have tried the Petmate dog crate and it just is not very sturdy compared to the Midwest. I have had another crate with a single twist lock mechanism. While that crate was decent, the dogs quickly learned they could use their teeth to lift up the door to open it. If the door is locked, then they still won't take ""no"" for an answer and consider to bite and salivate and make a huge mess to where the entire door has rusted out and I've just ordered another Midwest to replace it.This create is easy to setup, it is solid and secure, and it is easy to get break down to move it around. It is easy to get the tray out of the crate in those cases where there has been an accident and you need to clean the tray.My only gripe is that the tray is not the strongest part of the system. Our first tray lasted a year or two but wound up breaking into pieces. Fortunately, they do sell replacement trays (though they are expensive relative to the price of the crate itself). The bad news, though, is that we have only had the replacement tray for a couple of months and it is already broken in one corner.I have just ordered another Midwest crate to replace one that rusted out and plan to use a previous reviewers suggestion of putting the cardboard underneath the tray... hopefully that will provide a bit more support and protection for the tray and make it last longer. If so, that is a simple solution that would bump my review up to 5 stars."
215254,2,"I bought this fountain as an ""upgrade"" and what i got was a waste of money. I never write negative reviews like this but i am a major cat lover and i don't want anyone to buy this for their cat because i think it's unsanitary. The design of this fountain isn't very smart. There are way too many parts, corners, nooks, and crannies for things to hide. If you do buy this don't put it anywhere near your dry food because it will fall in and you will see how it doesn't even filter the water and then all the slimy cat food residue will get stuck in all of the nooks i mentioned and you'll have to spend a half hour trying to get into very small places and fit this massive thing under your faucet. either way the food will clog the filter and you will just have a basin of nasty cloudy water. It's no better then giving them water in a bowl, a bowl is easier to clean and change and doesn't make noise. It's just an awful fountain, looks way better then it works and after two weeks of battling with it I'm throwing it away."
55221,2,"Maybe it's a good idea but... My cat just wouldn't go for it. I guess she's set in her ways. I tried and tried ""training"" her but she has no interest in eating her food away from her food dishes. She's unusual in that she won't touch people food, and the only food she'll eat that's offered to her outside of her food dish is an occasional cat food ""treat."" (She's not picky about her food, but obviously feels it belongs in her dish and not on the floor in other areas of the house.) I wasn't happy stepping on stray pieces of dry food laying around the floors either.So...Didn't work for us."

I keep these and the bully sticks in my freezer. The frozen bully stick keeps my labrador busy for a few hours. These treats are gone before my car has left the driveway. For the reviews that say this product is smelly, keeping it in the freezer in a freezer baggie solves that problem."

22223,1,"I have always been good about brushing my cat. She loves it, and it helps with the shedding and hairballs. I have used a slicker brush, a bristle brush, a comb and a glove. All work okay, but I still would have a problem with shedding.I just recently got the Furminator brush and you would not believe the amount of fur it got off my cat! It was enough to make another cat. My cat likes being brushed by it (with the exception of her tummy) and it has really cut down on the shedding. There has been NO hair loss from the brush--only the undercoat comes out.I wish I would have gotten this brush sooner."
123051,2,"SHORT VERSION - We ordered this same product back in November 2011 and our cats LOVED it. Lasted a long time too. Just bought a fresh bag first week of September 2012 and this batch they will NOT even touch it! Bad batch??LONGER VERSION - We have 2 male domestic Tabby's almost 4 years old, and about once a week it's a ritual - we put the scratching post in the middle of the room and sprinkle two piles of Yeowww on the base, and it's kitty party time. They usually immediately start munching on it and rolling around in it, playing, and having a blast! We keep it sealed in a small plastic container for freshness and one bag lasted us a very long time, very happy kitties. BUT that was the first bag we bought. This new bag we just bought (same *exact* brand / packaging, same size, texture, smell) is a completely different experience for the cats. Following the same weekly ritual we sprinkled a couple piles on the bast of the scratching post and they came running over to get their usual ""fix"", but then something strange happened... instead of gobbling it up and having fun, both of them sniffed at it a few times and had no interest in it. In fact, what really amazed us was when one of the cats then tried to BURY it as if it were a pile of you-know-what, and then they both walked away. They wanted absolutely NOTHING to do with this fresh batch.We're absolutely puzzled by this and wondering - could this somehow be a ""bad batch"" that we received??I hate to give it 1 star but based on this experience I must. We now have to try to find a different brand that they liked as much as the previous bag of Yeowww. Big disappointment and a waste of money since it's not something we can't return for a refund (what could we base it on? I don't think saying ""our cats didn't like it"" would warrant a refund). Bummer :("
203931,0,"I bought this bed for my two larger dogs. One has hip and back issue so I wanted to buy a good, thick bed. One weighs 80 pounds and the other dog weighs around 60. I bought the larger sized bed and they both love it, however, within one month the middle of it is broken down and it's only about 1"" thick now. Again, my dogs love the bed, but it broke down too quickly. The cover does wash up very nicely and was easy to get on and off by myself. I think this would be a good bed for a dog that doesn't weigh much, but I don't recommend for a heavier dog."

178403,0,"I have had this box for a long time - about 3-4 years, I actually own two of them. So I feel I have given it a fair comparison to other types of boxes. I had to have a covered box to solve a dog snacking problem - it semi works, but we still keep the boxes behind baby gates. The reason we bought this box was the stair design. We ended up with a 6 week old kitten who was very very tiny and could not make the jump up into most litter boxes. When we got our third cat we needed a second box and got a second one just like what we had. The good thing about this box is that I do think it reduces litter tracking compared to others we have had - I don't think you ever get rid of it completely. Another plus is that I hardly ever notice foul smells (unless someone really drops a bomb in the box!)Here are my Negatives about the box and there are a few. I hate the rounded corners!!! One of my girls is determined to pee in them and it is a pain to scoop it out! The clumps always break up and its nasty to scoop out all the bits. On the positive side the bottom of the box it completely slick (no little seams for the pee to track in) so bleaching it down and cleaning it out is a breeze!! Another con is the shape of the box seems make it hard for my larger cat to get turned around inside. Every so often I go to scoop and find someone has peed down the stairwell - I hate that!!! It is a dire mess to clean and I know all the others have walked through it. The larger cat also poops over the side on occasion as well. Lastly is also due to shape - I think that it make it very dark inside the box. I know this may sound very odd to some but the bends and curves, I believe, block light from coming in like a normal covered box gets. The reason I comment on this is that my newer kitten seems to have trouble stepping in what he (or someone else) has deposited and then we end up cleaning poop off of his feet. This has become most unpleasant -especially in the middle of the night when he climbs into bed after using the potty. Needless to say we have traded these boxes in -and as a side note all the cats prefer the new box to the Booda. Hope this long review helps!"
179608,0,"I wanted to get the black one but they did not have it, I got the white with black paws, however, if you wash it, the paws or the paint they used comes off. I guess you can always buy stickers or stencil some more paws on it. The canister itself if made of very think ceramic, so be careful not to drop it, it will brake easily. Overall it does the job if you can take care of it."
54763,2,Product was defective. Parts did not fit properly. I feel the wrong part went to a smaller power head. The company replaced the powerhead but opened the package for the new powerhead and swapped out for the same part. I have 4 of these same powerheads so I know how they are packaged and how the parts fit. Woman from company wanted me to go to a hardware store and buy Pipe tape and repair it myself. I refused because I should not have to repair a new product. Problem not resolved. Will not purchase product again

On the large size it is super hard to get the treat in the ball for the first time, but after the first round of play it becomes easier- there's a reason- the seal isn't any good anymore, so it's super easy for the dog to hold down on one side of the ball, and lift out the treat.expensivesuper messy, slobber and treat goo get all over this thing and on your floorhard to wash and get dirt out of center folds"
100249,2,Sure did fail to spot (understand) the 12 count discription. Must have thought it would come as 12 packages for the money. That would have been a great deal.

169525,0,"I purchased this and the rainbow toy from Yeoww and my 6 month old kitten does not want to go by them at all, he is very playful, and if i try to play with him with this he will just walk away, he doesn't even want to go near it. I'm not exactly sure why, it seems like it has very strong catnip, so it might just be that he doesn't like the catnip. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does seem sturdy and I've had it for about 3 months now, and it still smells like catnip. I think some cats might just love the strong catnip smell, my cat just doesn'tupdate: The other day I actually saw him finally playing with them! i think the smell might have faded enough for him to like it, or maybe he isn't as picky any more"
141680,0,"Overall I was very satisfied with this sleep pad.My tom cat and younger female cat unfortunately are indifferent to it. Not for lack of quality though, they are just fussy.The product is well made and looks very comfortable. One thing to keep is the product makes a ""plasitc-e"" noise when moved or touched.

111903,0,"I thought that this bed was going to be durable as it is adorable. The material that covers the cushion and all around is very thin, I thought it was going to be of better padding on the inside and a thicker cotton cover on the outside (also the foam inside seems too light and cheap). I can already see my pup chewing away at it. It is a very pretty pet bed, but it isn't a very pastel pink that I expected it would be either. Shipping was fine, but as far as durability, I'm not sure it'll last my pups chewing."
111059,0,"This is a great price for such a large package of aspen bedding; however, the first time it was sent to me was in the plain brown wrapper (pictured) and it had multiple tears when it arrived. I may be pickier than most, but I don't like using/paying for a product that has spilled some of its contents while in transit. Amazon did make it right by resending the package boxed. The brown wrapper is not strong enough and the shredded material will make a mess if not properly contained.I have two guinea pigs in a large cage which I change every three days to keep it sanitary and comfortable. Buying smaller packages of aspen bedding is costly and time consuming. I've tried other options such as the paper and pellet variety, but frankly, they don't last much longer, control odor or really absorb any better and they cost more to use. If you are a small pet owner, you should be aware that you should not use regular pine shaving or pellets (or cedar for that matter) even though they are less expensive; the odor they emit is harmful to a small animal's respiratory system.In addition to the aspen bedding, I use two liners on the bottom of the cage, which I also buy in bulk. I would utilize these no matter what bedding I purchased. I have used both human grade chucks and the wee-wee pads for dogs; the former is less expensive. They provide an absorbent layer that draws the urine from the bedding as well as keeping it from seeping/pooling into the bottom of the cage; it makes clean up much easier. This system for small pet-cage maintenance took some trial and error to arrive at; it has worked well for me.Note: The texture here is coarse, so this bedding would likely not be my pick for a smaller animal, such as a hamster. There are smoother shavings available in smaller packages; in my experience they are a lot more expensive.) My guinea pigs seem to be fine with this; rough edges don't appear to be an issue as the shavings are quickly flattened. As a breed, to the best of my knowledge, guinea pigs aren't litter box trainable and tend to soil indiscriminately, so it doesn't make sense to me to spend more on a finer grade of shaving (or fluffy bedding) at this point. The compromise here is that the bedding may not be as soft as others, but it is economical enough to change frequently (plus there is no dust or fumes,) which is more hygienic and healthier in the long run.Update on 07/24/2012 from 09/27/11:My enthusiasm has waned...The price has jumped up considerably (approximately eight dollars) since my initial review and there has been another issue. The last two bags I purchased of this item had quite a few large chunks throughout; something akin to landscape bark. This time, I purchased aspen bedding from Foster's & Smith-their own brand-when it went on sale. While not less expensive, it is a softer, finer shred and of better absorbency & quality. Since this is no longer the bargin it once was, I think it best to look elsewhere."

122476,0,"I got the 40 lb 'vault'. I was hoping that the screw top thing on the lid would help keep dry food fresh for longer, but unfortunately the screw top is sort of useless. You can't get a 1 lb scoop and your hand in through the screw thing so you have to open the actual lid, making the screw thing useless. The 'vault' closes super air tight, which would be great if you could use the screw top, but as you cannot, I just end up setting the lid on top of the 'vault', so the food stays fresh about as long as if I left it in the bag. The 'vault' is quite sturdy, but is easily knocked over by a persistant and large animal because the base is narrower than the top."
53011,0,"Ordered this thinking the top and bottom were copper and would develop a patina over time. Upon receipt, the top (which is gigantic) and bottom are actually plastic.

155288,2,"I have tried anything I can think of to keep cat urine from leaking all over tile from this product, nothing works! I'm done, it's going in the trash. My adult male cat is not all that large but he hits the wall of container with urine and this causes urine to run down wall then to bottom and then to floor below. It would have been great if designer would have designed a tray to work properly with this container. I have tried puppy pads, no good, no better, just the worst mess ever. I have read other customer reviews since I started seeing this problem and others also have delta with this, I just don't know how anyone lives with this in their home. I have searched 10 plus pet stores for a better tray, but no luck... I really waisted a 100$ on this one. I never write negative reviews, mostly I buy good products, this is great looking, good construction just not well designed to fit a usable tray that won't cause such a mess with an adult cat. If mine was not urine soaked already I guess I could have turned it into a pet bed... Too late, it smells. Sorry to the designer but start shipping with a usable tray and make millions for many years and send me the first one."
24556,0,"Works great but made cheaply so doesn't last. I went through three the first 2 years, but Innotek replaced them 3 times and only charged the shipping cost.

105633,0,"Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally."

I watched a demo video of a large golden retiever being groomed by this and questioned how well it would work on my dogs which are a chinese pug and a yorkie (need it more for my pug cause she sheds like crazy!) but decided to give it a try. It extracts a HUGE amount of loose undercoat. I don't use it often enough to lessen the amount of dog hair I have on my furniture and carpet, but when I do use it, it does what it says it will do, so I can't complain. I would buy this again."
16838,2,"This is my third spray type bark collar. I've in the past purchase the Multi-vet brand and they worked great at first but quit after about 3 months. I decided for my new dog to try a different brand so, I brought the Premier brand. This one looks just like the others. The only difference is this one only worked for about a month. A month was not long enough to teach my new dog not to bark. Replacing the battery and cleaning the sprayer did help. I wish they would make a spray collar that would last."

81503,2,"I was pleased with this product when I first opened the package. It is made of a relatively thick quilted material to protect the seat, and I do like the plastic tubes that fit between the seat back and bottom to keep the cover in place. It actually worked very well for the first week or so. However there are some issues. The elastic straps on the bottom of the cover probably work great on elevated seats, but for nearly 100% of cars since the 1990's that have rear seats that are molded down into the car these straps don't work. The metal hooks that come with the other straps help to keep the cover anchored, but since nothing keeps those hooks attached to the cover, they get lost or misplaced immediately.The straps that hold the top of the cover to the headrests worked great at first, but after a week one of the very cheap, thin, and flimsy plastic buckles snapped from the weight of my dog as he was trying to maintain balance with the cover sliding on the leather seats under his feet. So now the cover looks terrible, sags on one side, and no longer protects the seat which is the entire purpose. I suppose it works if you want to buy a new one every other month, but then you might as well get a more expensive cover in the first place.2 stars because all this product needs is stronger straps at the top and a more clever seat anchoring system at the bottom. And from what I've read, it used to be that way before this company switched to cheaper components to save money."
164648,0,"Claimed to be a wall/door pet door as it can telescope for thicker walls. It could be a wall pet door if your wall is only 3 inches deep. The inserts that came in the package are supposed to hide the side exposed bare walls inside the pet door. These inserts are useless if your wall is thicker than the inserts. So we are now living with a door that functions, but until we figure out what product to insert on the sides we will have to deal with the unfinished look.I had to take out the magnet because it closed so well and tight my Westie was scared of it and refused to use it. He uses now but it is drafty because it won't seal, but that is our problem because we took out the magnet. Would be good for cold/ windy country because it does have a good seal when the magnet is in place. Your dog just can't be scetchy about the sound or having to push the door open with his head or nose. I am not over thinking the whole project because I didn't spend a lot of money on it."
153290,1,"OK, so the tempermental Cat Genie is a not for everyone. But for the rest of us, it's godsend. What these granules do for me is maintain a very sanitary litter box for a valuable 15 year old service animal on chemotherapy and help his person who has a compromised immune system and can't handle litter at all. I'm so grateful that I no longer have to deal with scooping and bagging and hauling, and fight the endless battle of odor and sanitizing.The granules track as bad as any other litter with the difference being they don't have ANY ""dust"" at all. You do feel it if you step on the individual granules, but if you put a large litter mat or a big plush rug in front of the litter box, the granules will be caught in them and you can pick up the edges of the rug, shake loose the granules and then dump them back into the box, using the rug to funnel them.There is no solution to cat litter boxes unless you have a full time maid, but this is one option that I think is the best solution for indoor litter boxes for many of us. If you have the need for bacterial reduction and minimizing dust, this is as good as it gets."

98670,1,"If you're wondering whether you should get the Flexi all-belt leash or the corded leash, go for the all-belt! We have a 1 1/2 year old Havanese and I have purchased THREE Flexi corded leashed since we got him as a puppy... each of them only lasted a few months. The all-belt leash that is listed here is AWESOME: sturdy, easy to hold and easy to lock! Our dog is only 13 lbs, but he shoots off like a rocket on walks and this handles him really well. I would absolutely recommend this leash!"
45715,0,"This product came very highly recommended and after careful desensitizing we were able to use them on two of our dogs. They walk nicely individually but when together pulling was a problem. It did help lessen the pulling but the number of times this tool was confused with a muzzle just broke our hearts...people saw only the straps, not the friendly well-behaved dog inside it. When you own a breed endlessly maligned in the media and largely misunderstood you find yourself doing everything you can to avoid further mistaken negativity.Instead, we just started back at zero and re-taught proper walking with another dog just as we had when she was by herself.The dog we continued using the headcollar with did fine but not when we tried to transition to a martingale collar when he grew out of the Gentle Leader. Without the Head Collar, all bets were off and he acted as if he didn't know any leash manners at all! So we had to start at the beginning and retrain him to walk correctly with only his collar when with other dogs, too.The Premier Head Collar is a highly effective tool, it just wasn't quite right for our situations. To avoid the same negativity issues with our new youngsters but obtain the same principles of control (turning the dog when it pulls and having excellent control in excitable situations as they learn good leash manners) we used the Premier Easy Walk harness--clipped to their martingale collars for extra safety, since athletic and determined dogs can wriggle out of the harness. They have transitioned from use of the harness to just their collars as they get older with none of the problems we had trying to transition from Head Collar to martingale only. This was probably entirely our fault but others might have had the same issues, too."
72065,0,"Given the winter we've had, batteries don't last long, even with the motion detector function. However, I've noticed less evidence of the six feral cats in our neighborhood since I began using this. It's just difficult to say whether it is this or winter keeping them at bay right now. The true test will be this Spring."
71866,1,"I bought 2 Cat Stops roughly 2 years ago when I saw the reviews on Amazon. I had hoped they would discourage neighbor cats that seemed to find my yard irresistible. To be honest, I didn't think they worked. I'd see cats stroll right in front of one with no apparent reaction. Admittedly I let them run down and didn't do a lot to clean them up or put in fresh batteries. My gardener got them even dirtier and blew off one of the battery covers one time. Contech was gracious enough to replace the cover at no charge since the unit was still under warranty.I got a feral cat coming in my yard roughly 4 months ago. I tried everything. Deterrents found on the web. Red pepper flakes, ground black powder, coyote urine...I could go on. Nothing seemed to faze him. At the time I didn't know he was a feral cat--I thought he was someone's pet cat that was free roaming (a violation of the city ordinance where I live). I contacted the city. They could cite the owner but I had to find out who the owner was. I talked to the neighbors where he exited the yard...neither owned the cat. In desperation I bought a trap, finally trapped him (after trapping 2 other neighbor cats and even more scary a raccoon (who knew raccoons like catnip?)). He had no ID and I found after having a vet scan him, no microchip. I decided to take him to the local shelter (even though I had to pay $10 to do it--not to mention gas and time). That's where I learned he was ear-tipped to indicate he was a released neutered feral cat. I despaired that the owner would locate him, bring him home and release him again (which is exactly what happened). The owners were very nice but couldn't figure out how to keep him home. I offered to trap him for them if he would buy into the trap again but I'd learned he was very smart and would probably never get tricked again. As I suspected, he looked at the trap but wouldn't take the bait. Frustratingly I'd watch him come back to the yard, stalk and kill the birds I encourage to come to the yard.I decided one day after chasing him for the 3rd time that I'd get the Cat Stop devices, clean them up, dry them out and put in fresh batteries. I did that and found on Contech's site that you could test to see if the device is working by laying it on its back and putting a pinch of salt on the speaker and swiping your hand over it to set off the motion detector. I did that. Salt didn't move. I was convinced they were goners but I decided to put them out anyway. I put them out along with fresh bait in the cat trap. Sure enough the sun came out and here came the cat. He walked over to the trap and checked out the new bait but didn't go in. He walked past the trap toward ""his spot"" and suddenly stopped. He stood for a moment...then turned around and went back across the yard and at some point went over the fence and left. I was shocked. That was the first time I ever saw him deterred from hanging out in his spot (which being a feral cat he thought was his territory and I was the intruder and nuisance). I haven't seen him since. I don't know if feral cats are more sensitive or if the concentration of two units in a small area increased the discomfort or what. I'm just EVER SO grateful that they finally did the trick. Being the cynic that I am, I keep looking out, expecting him to figure out a way to deal with this new addition to the yard...but he hasn't come back.I tell this long story to encourage others with a similar problem to try this product. I really didn't think it was doing much of a job but the Cat Stop unit is the ONLY thing that ever stopped this cat. I know something like a nuisance cat taking up in your yard and killing your birds should not make a person as crazy and stressed as this situation did me but it ate at me like a dripping faucet. Many people encouraged me to do harm to the cat or at least once I trapped him to take him a long way from his neighborhood to a farm or out in the woods and dump him, but I couldn't do that to someone's cat. As much as I grew to hate this cat for making my life miserable, I can't harm a cat--barring him attacking me. This cat wasn't aggressive or destructive--he just felt my yard was his turf and I was an annoying creature who wouldn't quit bothering him. I'm so glad we could both have peace in the end. Thank you, Contech, for bringing peace back to my life and my yard. And my birds thank you too."

78752,1,"This product is wonderful! It's a little awkward at first to get used to, but once you get it down it is so worth it. I have a 32lb boston/rat terrier mix and a 47lb lab mix (both wear a size medium) and I am able to walk both at the same time with ease. I highly recommend this product!"
37999,1,"I have to admit that I was more than a little nervous about buying this product at first. But I figured that I really had nothing to lose. If it wound up having all the problems that other people pointed out (busted tabs, leaking litter, etc.), then I would just take out the grate and make it a regular kitty litter box. I'm really happy to say that it worked out quite well! I can absolutely see how problems may come in later. The plastic is really cheap and definitely easy to break if you're not careful. The tabs look like they might just break off at any moment. I haven't had any leaking litter yet but I can see how it might happen. It's a large box but 1/3 of it is occupied by the grate, so this is only big enough for one cat to use. All these reasons are why I didn't give it a perfect rating.Despite all the potential problems, I am really really happy with the product! I absolutely hate scooping and this has made the process SO much easier! I used to wear a mask when I scooped because I hated all the small bits of litter that would fly into the air but I don't have to worry about that anymore! My cat has super clean litter because we are always cleaning it out, thanks to the process being so quick and easy! To avoid all the problems that I mentioned above, I placed her litter box over one of those cheap, giant bath mats. That way, if it ever leaks through, it won't get onto my carpet and its easy enough to vacuum or sweep up. This also provides an extra cushion for when I roll it, which I do very very slowly, so that there isn't a lot of wear and tear on the plastic. Because you can only have about 2-3 inches of litter inside the box at a time, on occasion there are clumps that attach to the side of the litter box. I just watch it filter through the grate and take a scoop to the clump if there is one. Since I just brush it off the side and I'm still not scooping through her litter, I don't consider it a big hassle. I really hope you decide to try this out because it has definitely been worth it for me!"

I hope the size 0 will work for him."
155370,0,"I have had and used this ""house"" to hide the litter box in my small one bedroom apartment for about ten months now and it has hidden the actual litter and kitty waste well from visitors but it is no secret that this is the litter box. I have two cats (one of which is about 18lbs and the other about 10lbs) that have very different bathroom habits that cause problems with this. Since the litter box that fits in (it's pretty small but has a high back) has a low front to allow the cats to walk through the ""ddorway"" in the front, there are often times where there's urine on the front-inside of the ""house"", down the door, and on the floor (my little one likes to face the back when she goes). When my big guy goes, half of his body is outside of the ""house"" causing urine (not often but it does happen) to hit the back of the ""house"" and travel down the seams onto the floor behind it. To help with this problem, I line the ""house"" and under the litter mat in the front with puppy pads and change them whenever there's urine to help minimize the smell and the wood from warping (i haven't figured out a way just yet to stop the door from warping, which has caused some problems in shutting the door without slamming it). In summary, this ""house"" is quite small for big cats and, depending on your cats habits, may not be the best for housing your litter but does hide the litter and it's waste from guests in a tight living space. If this were cheaper and my cats weren't used to using this for a litter box, I would consider buying and putting a pet bed inside for a little hideaway spot for my kitties."
60524,0,"I'm hesitant to criticize this product too much for 2 reasons: #1 We already had a pretty bad flea outbreak at our house when I tried FrontlinePlus on my 7 year old, 20 pound cocker spaniel. My vet said that most flea medicines work much better at maintenance/prevention but to get rid of an outbreak, the environment really needs to be treated with a fog. #2 - my sweet dog has epilepsy so a lot of different flea medicines that work through neuro-transmitters will give her seizures. (She has approx 1 seizure a month without flea med and 3-4 a month with it.) Program is the only one that doesn't give her seizures but it doesn't work for us either...that's what she was on leading up to the outbreak.That said, I still don't think this medicine worked very well. I'm not a fan of topical flea medicines anyway as I'm always concerned it's going to get rubbed on the wall or the couch or that one of us will touch it by mistake. The spot on my dog's back got very hot and stayed hot for many days. I can't imagine it's confortable for her. I didn't notice any decrease in the amount of fleas she had on her or in the amount she was scratching. I don't recommend Frontline.We've since switched to Comfortis, which is much more expensive. It's a pill form and requires a vet Rx. She's had some seizure increase with it, as it's also a neurotransmitter. However, the flea population and scratching are both diminishing. We also had our house treated by a pest company so that might be a factor."

Maybe they need the trainer collar."

I had thought that the dogs had gotten into something odd in the backyardbut I just saw where the black Kong had stained a cardboard container it had been stored by with black streaks.

After registering you can immediately unsubscribe from auto renewal for the premium service, but there appears to be no way around paying for a year of premium to get the chip registered with Home Again. I would say Home Again is deceptive as they really push the yearly enrollment w/o listing the basic option, and would have registered with the AKC service (also about $17, but for life) if I hadn't already had pets enrolled with Home Again and if my pets weren't cats (AKC will register any pet but it just seemed odd)."
101603,2,"I bought this a couple years back but never got to reviewing it. But anyways when I first got the product it worked great and everything operated properly. After about a couple of weeks I noticed that the water wasn't cascading across the whole surface and it was only dribbling out on a couple sides. I was able to fix it temporarily but the problem kept coming back. The temporary solution is to rub your finger all along the surface so the water coats it eventually it will start cascading across the entire thing instead of dribbling down. I got sick of doing this after while, who has the time to sit there and baby sit a water fountain? Sporadically my unit would suck in air instead of water, I checked the water levels, cleaned the filters and the pump, everything seemed to be in order. The thing that angered me most was how horrible the bowl design was, it's impossible to clean every little crevice and unless you're washing the thing every day and constantly changing the water, there will be some residue build up and calcium deposits depending on how hard your water is. I bought 3 extra filters, which I never used. I ended up throwing the unit away it just wasn't sanitary at all no matter how hard I tried and I didn't want my pet drinking out it. I would not recommend this product especially considering how expensive it is and the filters. You can give your pets Fiji water, it would be cheaper and last longer, probably healthier too."

From the label, it's clear that at least 2% of the ingredients are the same, but the undisclosed ""other ingredients"" might not be different either. Both products smell the same. The active ingredients are the same. A close look at the labels shows that out of the many paragraphs of text, most are the same word for word.I had higher expectations from Lambert Kay. TheirFresh 'n Clean Oxy-Strength Cat Odor & Stain Eliminatoris the best odor eliminator I have found. But with Boundary, they are selling a product that may repel cats for a while, but might not keep them away for an entire day. I expect that this will work for some people. Some cats are likely to dislike it, but not necessarily enough to stay away.I would not go so far as to say it doesn't work. If you buy this, you will be taking a chance. For some percentage of customers it will be an ideal solution. But don't expect a guarantee."

My husband and I had consulted several doctors and tried many different approaches and types of food to get her to eat. One day, out of extreme frustration, I went out and purchased at least 30 different wet and dry foods to see if there was anything on the market I could get her to eat. I laid out all of the foods, at once, in a room and left her in the room for a couple of hours. When I came back this was the only food she had eaten all of. I have been feeding her this food for months and she is now a much healthier 8 pounds. She seems to like all the wet varieties except for the egg souffl&eacute;s.

I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving. This does not mean that Blue Buffalo is not a good choice for your dog. Rather I would try it out and see how your dog does on it. If you find that their stools are not improving then switch."

One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again."

It holds a very small amount of bubble juice, and there's nothing to keep it in there so you have to keep it steady and straight or the liquid will drip out. How fun is that? I thought it would be like a water gun, where you put the soap inside the gun, but it's actually a small reservoir on the tip that has a small wand-like circle that lifts when you pull the trigger, which sends air through and makes bubbles.It would be a lot more fun and easy to get the kitty bubbles with a typical wand that you blow on.

130855,0,"These litter boxes are nice size and are good, but the lid locks don't lock properly and can make potential messes if not paying attention."
41978,1,"This was a wonderful choice...my dog absolutely lovessssss it! He gets to sit up so he can see everything, stay safe because he's harnessed in and be comfy because his seat is so cushie! Plus, on top of all of this, there's a storage drawer to put his things in when we travel. It is well worth every penny you pay for it!"
96958,2,"I like Oster trimmers and I do use this one, but I don't recommend it. It's too small, doesn't cover enough area and overheats a bit. You can find a better one for this price."
92602,2,"I purchased one of these for my turtle tank about a year ago. It quit working after about 3 months. Pump just died and nothing would revive it. I was very busy at the time and dug out an old, (5 years old) Aqua Clear fish filter. I used this filter until things calmed down, then purchased another of these, I figured the first was a fluke since Tetra is reputable company. It is now 3 months later and the new filter has quit. As soon as I post this review I am going to purchase a new Aqua Clear fish filter for my turtle."
103329,0,I thought that because this product was described as medium that it would be a little large than it was I guess I should have made more attention to the product description however I do think under closer examination I might have accidentally received a size down from what I purchased :( nothing I can do about it now
71969,2,"Second one I purchased on account of cat invading my driveway. First one lasted less than 1 yr. Battery kept getting shorted out in the rain. Finally, died. Second one has gone thru 5 batteries in 3 months. Also noticed that battery compartment still gets wet in the rain.This product is a complete waste of money"
215051,2,My 8 month old lab was skinning the green fuzz off this toy and swallowing it within an hour after opening. I tried to return it but the time period had elapsed.Very disappointing.
209950,0,"My cat leads a sheltered life and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect to get her outside but still be protected. She was fine with it until the neighbor animals came to visit and then she freaked. It was used for a total of less than a half hour and, after almost two weeks of practically continual hissing and screeching, I'm not going to try to get her back into it."
101328,0,I purchased this along with a Proselect cooling system refil thinking I was buying the fan and the refill but instead I got a refill and a refill with a holder for the refill..no fan. it's pretty conusing.
131031,0,"The flea trap overall works well. It is really good with knats and moths. We thought we were beginning to have problems with fleas, but so far we haven't found many fleas in the traps."
88763,0,"After the third time replacing my CatIT fountain due to a broken pump, I decided to try this fountain to see if it was any better. On the plus side, it was quiet and I liked the adjustable flow.However, I found that this fountain was just too much work to use and maintain. It comes apart into four pieces that all need to be regularly cleaned. In addition, the actual water pump needs to be regularly disassembled and cleaned. The water reservoir container has a poorly-designed cap that will make it likely that you will leak water when you try to place it into the fountain.Also (and I know this differs from cat to cat), around the time I started using this fountain, I noticed my cat started to drink out of toilets and people's water glasses, which was something she had never done before. As a test, I set a separate bowl of water for her, and noticed that she always drank from the bowl and never the fountain. From that, I surmised that she doesn't like this fountain, and so I eventually got rid of it. I now use a non-electric stainless steel dish with a gallon reservoir."
197888,1,Our Dachshund has had this ball for over two years and he just now got the ball out of the inside. What an exciting moment! Well worth the money. I'm going to purchase some for gifts.
72140,1,"I have a multicat household and have been using Feliway Diffusers for a couple of years. I do think it helps relax the cats. The diffusers don't quite last a month, and it is fairly expensive to purchase in stores. I've been purchasing on line for some time. This 6 pack deal is the cheapest I've found. The order came promptly with no problems."
88190,0,"Tired if turning on faucet (and forgetting to turn it off!!) for my cat to drinkI thought this would be a great solution. Well, my cat won't have anything to do with it. Aside from this, it is somewhat noisy and a pain to clean and refill. Just unplugged it for now. May try again another day."
167873,1,"I have 3 little dogs and a very small backyard. Need I say more? The size of this septic-tank seems to be perfect for the number of dogs I have. It took me about an hour to dig the hole (using a post hole digger). So far I have no complaints about the system. I installed it about 2 months ago and it's working perfectly. The top of the tank is plastic. I read one reviewer's comment that said the top had cracked after some time. Mine seems to be holding up well so far. Once I've used it for a while, I'll add more to my review."
364,1,"Our Shiba Inu, Maya, loves these. First and foremost, the packaging says Made in the USA and that makes them worth buying right there. They are quite light and airy (being freeze dried) and are easy to crunch or gum for older dogs. A definite go to treat for any canine companion."
117285,2,This was junk and was missing the pieces. I was to busy with work to send it back. This was the most dissapointed I have ever been with an amazon product. dont waste your money or time
100220,2,"My dog loved this toy. Unfortunatley, it is not a toy for agressive chewers. It lasted all of about 45 minutes."
139584,0,"My cat seems to enjoy the other Felidae canned food flavor, so I thought I'd try another flavor, to keep him from growing bored or finicky.He seemed reluctant to eat it at first, and then just refused to eat this stuff altogether. He actually didn't eat for nearly two days. I thought he was sick! Turned out he just hates this flavor.But Felidae is a great, protein-rich brand!"
14124,1,A womnderful water bottle for any small animal. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is because there is no measurement lines on the side to keep track of the water in take from the little critter.
96865,0,I typically order the Platinum Filters but ordered these by mistakes. They are OK but expect to change more often if you usually order the Platinum filters. If you have a drinkwell fountain these filters are a must.
191015,0,My dogs loved this ball and had lots of fun getting biscuits out of it -- for a day. Within 24 hours my collie mix had chewed a giant hole in it. Maybe less powerful chewers would do better with this ball.
209256,2,"""Be Warned"" Yes this is a clever idea at first glance. Unfortunately the product does not work efficiently and the company does not back up their product return. Due to the large quantity of food coming out at one time the company advised that we take the dispenser apart and move the dial to a desired setting (why isn't this in the instructions? wait...there are no instructions). They said we could return the dispenser if we still had problems but would first need to call. We tried their suggestion and unfortunately same result. We made numerous calls about a return and were told each time that they had to check with the supervisor and would get back to us. Still waiting. . . Anyway, will be passing it along to someone else who allows their pet to eat large amounts of food all day. By the way, any cat who eats all day will have major gastrointestinal problems! What a mess!"
159817,0,"I purchased the Super Bark Stop about a month ago and it has produced mixed results. I have been satisfied with the product concerning the labrador dog next door. It has completely worked with this type of dog and she doesn't bark at all now. However, the bassett hound is not affected by the product. If anything, the Bark Stop causes this dog to bark more as it interprets the sound as an intruder rather than a deterrent. Therefore, I am pleased with the results, but also disappointed."
100071,1,Great for any household that have people with allergies. Have kept me from getting any allergies from the dog.
57146,2,"I hate to be negative, but this product just doesn't work in controlling fleas. Had no problem with the price or receiving the product, but I thought it would work for several months. A treatment is supposed to work for close to a month, but we've had to re-apply every couple of weeks and are still seeing fleas. Will not purchase Frontline again, I'm afraid."
106015,1,"These small moist treats are perfect for training - the size means you can work with your dog for quite a while without worrying about over feeding. The peanut butter flavor seems to be a favorite but he likes the beef and salmon as well.I appreciate that these treats are made in the U.S. out of ingredients I feel comfortable with. Zuke's is a pet food company I feel I can trust! I also like that they don't smell terrible, like some moist snacks can!One tip - these will dry out pretty quickly if left open - so keep the bag sealed up! Our dog will still happily eat them when they've gone crunchy but they're clearly not quite as exciting to him once they're no longer squishy."
45389,1,"We were in despair over our rescue pooch who, at only 14 pounds, was yanking our arms out on a regular leash and collar walk. A pet store trainer recommended this and at first I thought it was a muzzle, which seemed cruel to me. It isn't. She can open her mouth normally and is not restrained in any way. In fact, our dog's long thin neck was vulnerable to injury before the Gentle Leader. It was amazing - she is not overly fond of it (will try to rub it off at times) but from the first walk she marched down the road on a loose leash. We are trying to train her not to jump on visitors and for some reason she is calm and polite when it is on in the house as well. Please follow directions carefully as to fit and check often. If you have a dog with a short nose this may not work for you but it is a miracle for our cocker spaniel/chihuahua mix."
188117,0,"I bought this for my 80lbs dog to wear during hunting season. I really like the vest, everything fits well except for his private area. The strap goes right over his parts, and if I left the straps dangle, he would pee on them. So, since I spent the money on it, I will probably just cut off the back straps and let him wear the vest like a cape."
69748,2,"We have 2 dogs, a Golden Retriever and a Poodle-mix, who both think that they have to defend the house when someone walks by; it irritates us, and the person going by. We will not use bark-collars, so I was happy to find the Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Contol, and ordered it as soon as I discovered it. We have had it about 6 weeks, and it has been totally ineffective. We tried different locations, and different angles, but it simply did not make any difference. The battery had to be replaced within this 6 week period, although they say that it should last longer. It's not the end of the world, but we are very disappointed in this product, and would certainly not recommend it based upon our own experiences."
81371,2,Got two bags of these for my dog. For some reason they make him have to go poo almost instantly. Tried two different flavors and the both make him sick. He does not normally have intestinal issues. I'm going back to regular milk bones or zukes.
188743,2,Wellness kitten brand cat food has been recalled twice. It made my kitty sick both times and we had no idea it was the cat food. I will never buy this product again. The company did a poor job communicating the recall to its customers. Our cat's thiamine level was affected.
217114,1,I received the pond netting just in time to keep the leaves out of our fish pond. The product works great! I would recommend this to anyone trying to keep debris out of the filter
160493,0,"I have seen a couple of my cats enjoy themselves as they play with this toy, and I think I've seen all of them use the scratch pad. Only drawback, and this could just be a behavior problem of my cat, but he seems very attracted to using the cardboard as a pee collector. If it were not for that, I would keep it out all the time. Unfortunately, even when I removed the cardboard and washed it, the cat was still attracted to using it as a bathroom. I guess the plastic absorbed the odor. I'm not sure if all cats react the same way to cardboard. But after seeing the delight on my cat's face, I bought one for my sister's cat.Note: Later, I bought the style without the center, that looked like a crib toy. That went over well, except that it came apart and I had to use duck tape to keep it together."
89993,1,"I have had more success with these litter boxes than with the regular plastic litter boxes.My ferrets just really prefer using these. I think it's because they prefer the texture of the cardboard. Their feet dont slide around like they do in the plastic boxes.Also, they are more absorbent and hygenic and less odor, definitely. You are supposed to keep them for up to a month and then replace them.It might seem like a hassle having to buy replacements but it's worth it when you dont have to clean up ferret poo around the house!"
182780,2,"I got this as a wedding present (to each their own). I thought that it would be the greatest thing on the face of the planet - no more scooping litter, and and no more mess. Considering at the time of my wedding, my precious little kitten topped 20 lbs, he produced more waste than many dogs. The rake on this got jammed CONSTANTLY. it normally happen about 2 or 3 in the morning, right after he used it. When it didn't get jammed, it flung, uh, crap, across my laundry room. I kept it for about 8 months, realised that I handled the litter less with a box of sifting litter box liners (about $[...] US) and kept the box area cleaner."
120656,0,"I liked this and it was working well for a while, but then my dog decided he wasn't into the taste and stopped eating his food when I put it over it. Had to stop using."
88695,2,"The fountain was OK while it still worked - although it was very difficult to clean. However, after 11 monthes its engine died, so the whole thing stopped working. By the time we got ourselves to sending it somewhere - the 12 months guarantee expired (and besides - they probably would have told us we didn't clean it often enough - which admittedly we did not)It was also very big and cumbersome.[...]"
27105,0,"They were crumbly and, surprisingly, the dogs were fairly unexcited about them when we went to give them the treats."
147388,2,"This collar is not strong enough for my large breed Border Collie. She continues to bark and bark. I see the collar light up with each bark and it doesn't even phase her. I thought maybe it was because she was so furry, so I shaved the part of the neck when the contacts were, but it didn't make a difference. Who knows, maybe it would be better on a smaller dog."
211212,0,"Unfortunately, my pug didn't like these steps no matter how many times we practiced and enticed her with treats. I think if she was totally incapable of jumping up on the sofa, we would have been able to get her to use it. May have to try again in the future. The stairs are somewhat flimsy, and needs to be pushed up against the sofa, bed, etc., and somehow anchored in place, otherwise, it will slip about. Not a bad product for the price."
8290,2,"These are okay thermometer covers. As an occupational therapist, I worry because they tend to rip easily and I definitely don't want to spread germs between patients. They are better than some other ones I have used though! Overall, these are okay."
166119,0,I bought these from my pet grooming drill. The coarse bands work better for trimming my dog's nails. The grinding stones are too smooth and don't file much off.
141329,2,"We humans may find this an attractive and safe bone alternative - but it seems to be totally boring from a canine perspective. My dog who usually loves to chew anything (bones, rawhide, wood, etc.) could not care less about this ""bone"". I tried several times to get her interested in the Nylabone - to no avail. At this point, she will not even take it into her mouth when I try to hand it to her."
51320,0,"The 2-quart size was different than pictured, with upward protrusions on the handle connections; and the 4-quart size had tiny sharp protrusions inside the bucket from the handle connector. However, the 6, 9 and 13 quart sizes had no such problems."
111580,0,"My dog really likes this toy, but the material is very hard, and I worry that it may damage her teeth (no problems yet though). The good news is that the ring shape makes it less likely she will get it back to her molars."
188526,2,"I guess my american eskimno is deaf,pushing a button on this thing is wearing me out. He pays no attention, its has no effect on him at all. ended up going for a bark collar. Save your money,start mith something that does work."
40395,0,"My poor little one just can't seem to figure this thing out. It's hit and miss with him. He is a fairly small kitty, I would even say below average in size. He just can't seem to fit in this thing. Sometimes he accidentally poops outside of the door. I think the inside is significantly smaller than the standard box that he's used to, and either his head is sticking out or his bum is sticking out-which creates extra clean up for me. Also, when rolling the box litter sometimes spills out of the cracks and I always check to make sure the latches are tight. I love the concept of the box and I do think it occasionally makes things easier on me, but I would just recommend that you get a larger one, and maybe keep a small broom and dust pan near by for cleanup."
51162,1,Hands down the best investment I've made since venturing into the fish keeping hobby. I was hesitant to get a bigger tank than the 55 gallon I already had because I wasn't interested in the amount of work it would be to do water changes. After buying the python I quickly upgraded to not only a 75 gallon but also a 125 gallon as well. Literally makes water changes effortless. I would give it six stars if possible.
4884,1,It's working wonders on our Maltese. Also on our YoChon. Both eyes are no longer running! Thanks so much for making such a great product.
154643,0,"I've found myself needing to clean cat poop out of the collection area every 3-4 days or so.It works somewhat as-advertised, but there needs to be a better non-disposable tray option. Right now, all you can do is look on auction sites and they are quite overpriced.Occasionally, the rake mechanism makes a sound like a slipping belt, but it's still working. I hope that it lasts...Also, only one of my cats has fully adjusted to the litter box. The other two have thus far continued using the old litter box even though I stopped cleaning it frequently and have been mixing in more and more crystal litter."
151882,0,"One issue is with the food itself. Some the food in some cases is firm and stays together while in other cases, it is very soft and mushy. The entire case follows the same pattern. Company says it has something to do with the ingredients and the cooking. We are concerned that it may not be cooked thoroughly. Dogs do like it and it does not seem to affect them regardless of the consistency. Have had this experience with both the large and small cans. We still use the food and would recommend it.The packing and shipping by Amazon is another problem. Amazon packs several cases in a box with paper or air bags to ""fill the empty space"". Neither of these methods work and cans are often dented and have even had the top punched in on one can. After a week or so, it started smelling like something dead and upon investigating all of the cases, found the problem to be the punched in top on one of the cans. This allowed air in and food had started to rot. This is strictly Amazon's problem and while we are Prime members, we have had many experiences with poor packing on many items. Amazon is good about replacing broken items once you let them know."
20101,1,This Feline Pine is fantastic. There is no odor and it cleans up neatly. It just melds into a fine clump. I use the big scoop you can get for free with their points program. Finally there is hope for cat litter.

114684,0,"In the image of the product, one can see the fastener is black. Upon confirming at the Planet Dog website, the fastener is plastic, not stainless steel as advertised in the product description."
190322,0,"My small bird has not taken to the perch as I had hoped. Other reviews raved about it and I thought it would be nice for my rather cool house. The plastic that the perch is made from is not very comfortable to my bird. We still keep it plugged in when it's cool and place him on it when he goes back into thc cage. We've only been using it for just under a month, so I'm hoping it will still catch on. I think it is a great idea, I just have to convince my bird."
61405,2,"Although the idea sounded great - not having to manually clean out the cat litter every day for two cats - the littermaid comb is too weak to actually move the gunk out into the plastic receptacle. Although I got the deluxe, supposedly for multiple cats and/or big cats, I end up having to clean it all up myself. Also, the plastic construction is rather flimsy - the plastic piece that moves up and down covering the waste receptacle broke on the first day."
123890,2,Do not buy this for your small animal! This is BY FAR one of the smallest/worst cages I have ever seen. NOT a suitable home for your pets! I would give it zero stars if I could.
21000,2,"The first 3 - 4 times my male 20 pounder pug wore this, it stayed on, now he knows how to get it off every time. The medium size seemed a little tight for him, so I got a large, the large is too big, I sewed it smaller, but he get the large one off also."
117906,0,One of my cats doesn't seem repelled by this product. He continues to claw at my box spring. It may me just him and not this product.

14606,2,"Here i sit with my 1 1/2 year old Japanese Chin 8 hours after Advantix application.When the time came for us to have quiet time, she came to my lap and i noticed she was shivering and staring into space. She is now hyper and will not rest, even though it is 3am.She continues to shiver and prance, holding her tail awkwardly. Another oddity is when i pet her she jerks her legs.There were no other variables to her day. i became concerned and searched if this med has reputation for causing adversities. YES! Please read about the effects beforehand and your will find other reports of reactions!!! POISON!!!Everyone needs to report their reactions to the FDA, Here is link[...]"
56319,0,"Lasted a couple of years before the hooks that connected it to the cage broke. I mostly used the hooks for stabilizing while it was resting on something, but I did sometimes hang it completely on the hooks. It's annoying not having them now because the house ends up all over the place now. Otherwise worked well. My chin likes it better when the flat side down though."
34755,0,Flakes crumble almost to powder when touched but can use powder to feed fry. Just makes water cloudy in large tanks and fish still hungry.
153422,0,It is not 3/8 and I find this just too stiff for my little one. But if she were not so small I suppose it would be okay.
110119,0,This product works great for my dog. I did find this product at a lower price somewhere else. Regardless this is a very good product.
89445,0,"These bandannas are small - even on my 1 lb ferret. My 3 lb ferret looks choked wearing one of these. It is also disappointing that you are at the mercy of the manufacturer (Marshalls), as they change the pattern and color at whim, so you don't always get exactly what you order. Other than that they are made well and have a handy strip of velcro for doing them up."
91839,0,"I've had mine for a couple of years and it's still holding up. I keep it outside, so it's take the weather fine (though this is California). It assembled very easily and I got the ramp, which is definitely worth it. My only problem is that it's too low for small dogs. The bottom is knee high, so you can get a back ache. The sink is better for my cavi.It's very convenient if your dog is always getting muddy and needs a quick hosing off. If not, I'd stick to taking them to the dog wash at the pet food store.I also bought the hot water mixer, they call the "" tropic shower "" - The off/on valves are made of very cheap pot metal and broke after a few uses. They ([...]) promised to send me a replacement, but never did and would not answer my follow-up e-mails. Anyway, you can build your own for less money."
12354,0,"These leashes are amazing! Unfortunately, I was looking for the cord leash and not the tape leash. The seller had it listed as a cord leash when in fact it was a tape leash. The seller responded to all my e-mails in resolving the issue and sent a return postage paid envelope to return the product for a full refund since they didn't have the leash I wanted. So, even though it was a bummer not to get the product I wanted, I was impressed with how the seller resolved the issue."
67370,0,"I received this product the first of July and at first was very pleased with the item. It was plenty big for my chihuahua and installation was a breeze. The problem I ran into was the durability of the product. In less than 2 months the straps that hold the front part of the carrier disintegrated and broke. A slight tug on the strap and you could break off a piece. My dog enjoys the seat so much, that I'm not going to return it but instead put new straps for the front of the seat.I'm not sure if others have had this problem or whether the fact that I live on the Big Island of Hawaii has an effect on the straps deteriorating.I have no complaints with Amazon and do most of my shopping with them. When they say shipping is free they mean it, even if you live in Hawaii or Alaska."
27529,0,I purchased the squirrel for our puppy that can destroy most toys. First off this is not a squirrel it looks more like a beaver. second it is really not intended for dogs over 10 pounds. It states it is for dogs 10 to 25 pounds and my 15 pound puppy had this completely in his mouth the moment I gave it to here. I did buy the large one and she loves it.
89922,0,"Needed a good food bowl set for my 20-lb terrier who likes to spill water all over the place. This pet feeder did the job. Like the other reviewers said, the really weird grey panels that were pseudo-attached to the plastic holder totally caused a WTF moment, but after I removed and threw them away, the feeder looks better and is fine. Money well spent. Maybe the manufacturer will stop making those pieces and lower the price by a couple of bucks, which would make this a really good bargain."
94701,0,This collar was great a first! It worked for about 6months then we had to buy a new one cause it stopped working. The 2nd one worked for a bit but our dog started to figure out that if she barked 10 or more times the collar would run and then she was a free women to bark all she wants. So we had to keep refilling it. I bought numerous refills and replacement batteries for the collar. It finally got to the point where the collar was just blowing air not even the spray was working. So we finally bit the bullet and went with the shock collar.
170955,0,"This is good for what it is. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I should have done more research. Its made nicely and the pup seems to like it ok.I think it will work for short trips. If you have a very small dog it will work just fine, any dog over five pounds will be uncomfortable, my opinion only.I will buy a larger one next timeThank YouBob and Char"
34958,0,"As in the title, it works, but because I bought used it was missing a few screws and bolts. I jerry rigged it so that it works, and it is ok."
77637,0,"My husband and I recently adopted a 3 yr old Bullmastiff from a local animal shelter - unbeknownst to us, she has separation anxiety! While this crate is easy to assemble/disassemble, it did not stand up well in her attempts to escape. Within an hour she had started bending the frame near the door; within a few hours, her paws were sticking out of the 6"" opening she had made. My hubby was able to bend it back into place (more or less), but we have since purchased a heavy duty crate to safely contain her while we're away. We're still utilizing the Midwest crate at night when she can see us but, unfortunately, it's not sturdy enough for our 100 lb. dog experiencing separation anxiety during the day."
198263,0,"My cats always loved this food - this is the first time I ordered it from Amazon. Don't know what changed, but they didn't care for it at all. Don't know if this was a bad batch, or if it wasn't stored properly, but something is different. Now I'm stuck with almost a full case and am out $30. Guess I will donate to local shelter....."
74562,2,This gate will sahow up in a baby gate search but the instructions that come with the gate clearly state that it is NOT TO BE USED WITH CHILDREN!
121004,0,"I took the plunge and bought both the gel and spray. I already normally brushed my dogs teeth daily with another brand's poultry toothpaste. The new routine was two sprays in the morning after a quick brush with water, and in the evening I put the gel on a toothbrush to apply, then two more sprays. I really only missed two evening applications because I fell asleep.I thought this product would be great. Seeing as how I just got my male IG's teeth cleaned, I thought this product would be a great preventative and hopefully take the place of future cleanings. Here's my results after over 30 days of use. My female IG's breath smelled better, it could be from the alcohol in it. Not much change in plaque. My male had no change, but keep in mind his teeth were already clean. So, I guess it kept them clean. I feel like if I just used my old toothpaste twice a day instead of once it would have done the same job.So, I stopped using it and went back to my old toothpaste, only now they get brushed twice a day. The main reason why I stopped was because they really hated the gel and spray! They would run away from this instead of running to me like before. They just LOVE their poultry toothpaste, it's like a treat to them. I get compliments on how well behaved my dogs are when getting dental exams, I would hate to change that behavior.After using the product for 30 days, I have come to a conclusion. The product is rather easy to apply, much quicker than a full brushing with standard paste. With that in mind, I think more users will be likely to keep up the regimen. So for most people, this will provide a decent result with minimal effort. However, since I normally brushed at least once daily already, I don't think there was much of a difference."
124807,0,my dog is still scratching after two months of applications. so not sure if this stuff really works or not. i will try a different brand when i run out and see if there is something better.
186421,2,"My sister used this stuff on her cat. She got terribly sick and started having tremor convulsions. She is now at the vet's office getting an IV to try to get the stuff out of her system. They did the same treatment yesterday (IV). The vet is not sure she is going to make it. She also purchased the dog treatment. It made one of her dogs really sick but did not affect the other one. If you really care about your pet, spend the extra few bucks and get Frontline or Revolution, or whatever is recommended by your Vet. This stuff should be taken off the market."

WRONG!It has a very weak spring, and leaves half the poop in the grass.Save your money and just use your grocery store bags."
118232,0,They worked great for about a week. My dogs are pretty active and the caps ended up wearing all the way through. When I took off the few that didn't fall off on their own you could see right through them
134539,0,"I purchased the Marineland Emperor Power Filter 400 to replace a five year old Tetra Whisper filter. I chose the Emperor 400 because I have another 5 year old Marineland filter that uses the same size replacement filter. The problem with this system is, how, do you reduce the water flow during feeding since there is no switch to reduce the water flow?I called Marineland tech support about this issue thinking I overlooked the switch. I was told by tech support that they do not know why Marineland decided not to have a water flow switch to reduce the water flow during feeding. The tech support person stated I could un-plug the power to filter system during feeding and re-plug the power back in after feeding. I am thinking, returning it will be less trouble than un-plugging and re-plugging it every day.I have three other power filters, one by Marineland and two by Tetra that have water flow switches. Since, I want to standardize my replacement filters maybe I will purchase another Tetra Whisper instead of a Marineland. I am not sure why Marineland decided not to have a water flow switch in the new version of the 400."
63417,0,This is ok. The little pointer deal tends to really get air bubbles clinging to i which can throw the readings of significantly. I spend a lot of time poking the needle with a dropper trying to knock all the air bubbles off.
207347,0,"I ordered this product because it was advertised as light-weight and easy to assemble. The photo looked as if the dog inside would have good visibility to the outside.The crate is not easy to assemble and requires strength. While not terribly heavy (22 lbs), it is heavy given the bulkiness of the crate. The weight makes assembly harder. The netting is so dark in color that there is not good visibility for the animal inside; instead it is kind of claustrophobic. I returned the crate."
161762,0,"I was given one of these clickers from my dog trainer and I liked it at first. However, about a week into it i was sitting on the floor training Chomper and I raised my hand, the clicker flew out, hit the wood floor and the orange button fell off. You can still use it by putting your hand into the hole where the button was and clicking but its pretty annoying now to use.I was sad."
86690,0,This product was okay. We have dog with serious skin flakes. He has been like that since a puppy and is now 12 years old. The past year he went through a really bad bout of skin irritation. I did not see a difference in his skin condition at all when using this product. I ended up going to the vet and getting some prescription strength. I found the pump on the bottle a pain - probably because the shampoo is so thick. I will not buy again.
125937,0,The shelf had to be modified to hold our cat's weight(8lbs). I had to drill out a hole on the wall support bracket and anchor to the wall. Easy to do. May be the manufacture could add this to the product ?
145105,0,"The good about this is that my older dog stopped chewing the end of the coffee table after we sprayed it. It also kept him off the bed. There was never any problem with staining or anything. For my younger dog however, she took a few sniffs and actually licked it. I even sprayed it near her and she jumped back but then smelled it and licked it off. I don't know why. I suggest you might want to purchase the smaller 8oz. until you know how your dog will react."
155659,1,These are kinda stinky but the price is really good.. the ones in pet stores are usually stinky too except they cost more so i thought id give it a try. My dog ended up loving them so no regrets with this purchase.
58490,0,"This is a great toy, but the bottle is just too big for a small dog. The only way to get the treats out is to turn the bottle upside down and my dog's mouth is too small to grab the base of the bottle and he weighs 20 lbs. He can demolish a bully stick in less than five minutes, but cannot grab the base of this bottle to stand it on it's top. It's a clever toy for a medium to large dog!"
110885,2,"MY GOLDEN RETRIEVER MANAGED TO CHEW THE CENTER, REMOVEABLE PIECE OFF AND GOT A PART OF IT STUCK IN HIS MOUTH.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. GET THE ATOMIC ""MOLECULE BALL"" INSTEAD. ITS SOFTER AND MORE PLIABLE AND NOT NEARLYAS DANGEROUS."
114956,2,"We set up the panic Mouse 360, and our cat just looked around for the source of the noise, but wasn't at all impressed by the bouncing black ball on the stick. When we turned it off, he grabbed the ball, but the whole arm came off. A little crazy glue solved that problem, but he just isn't impressed at all by the turned on toy. He's a bit hard to please, I guess."
71260,1,This is a great item and it really works. I have seen such a difference onmy Brussels Griffon. Will not be without it anymore. She really does love it too!
158383,2,"Use with caution. I would love to love this crate and give it five stars and would except for the fact that, unfortunately, as other viewers have mentioned, it is possible for a puppy or very anxious dog to catch their mouth or paw in the areas where the sides connect. As you can see in product photo, there are smaller spaces of wiring at top and bottom corners that connect the sides of cage. It would be better designed if there were smaller mesh for entire cage area preventing the dog from even being able to get mouth or paw into the spaces. My puppy yelped when he briefly caught his paw at the top front corner. He has calmed down enough now and is very comfortable in this crate with his ProSelect Pawprint Dog Cage Cover and Pad Set in black that I also purchased on Amazon for an amazing price, and is a very good match for this crate! A friend of mine also owns this crate (and same cover/pad set) but never mentioned this happening to her hyper Jack Russell or mini Aussie, so just be aware."
92399,0,"My cat likes this toy fine but she doesn't go crazy for it like she does for the bird pole (a pole attached to a string with a feather lure on the end). She will very rarely leap into the air after it. I have to drag it along the ground away from her to get her interested (which involves a lot of work on my part since it means I can't stay in one place) and then she pins it and her claws get stuck in it. A declawed cat might enjoy it more because the ribbon would just slip through its paws. With my cat it is sort of a pain to use. It's more fun just to tie it around her and watch her try to run out of it. Not sure how fun that is for her, though. Next stop, laser pointer."
196813,0,"The bag came on time and was in excellent condition, however the dimensions are misleading. I would not consider this a ""large"" bag. It was long but very short. It would be good for a toy breed or a kitten but nothing larger.If I had smaller pets I would have loved this bag, but it did not suit my purposes (two medium sized kittens)."
123468,2,Only lasted a couple days!! My doberman was able to chew the sides off of it. Kind of expensive for a toy that only lasts a few days.
119078,0,"My German Shepherd is not really interested in this bone. He likes many natural bones but really is not interested in this one - so it was not really useful to me. However, if your dog goes for this bone it will probably provide hours of pleasure. Recommended with reservations."
15032,0,"I bought this as my 6 yrs old JRT started suffering from seperation anxiety recently. He barks and barks and barks and barks... when we are not at home. Received lots of complaints from angry neaighbours. He is not alone at home, there is another puppy to keep him company.The collar works wonderfully initially. However, it stopped working after about 2 months. At first we thought that battery was low thus changed a new battery. But, it still doesn't work. I tried testing it by rubbing it against a rough surface, only sound and light, no static or whatsoever.The device was also too big for my 5 kg JRT. I tried tightening the collar till I can't insert a finger, but he still managed to shake it and moved the sensor to the back of his neck.Waste of money and it is really expensive here in Singapore, about S$140. But we haven't got much choice coz this is the only brand of static collar they sell here."
143474,2,"I bought this product because my cat would leave litter everywhere because she would jump out through the side of her box instead of using the ramp. When I brought it home I proceeded to put it together, this took awhile. You have to snap together some very flimsy plastic rods that kept on coming apart everytime I thought I had it together. Once I finished the very shaky frame I had to put on the plastic cover, it zips on all the way around. It's not as easy as it sounds. Once I got it all set up, my cat investigated it, she was fine with it. Then after a week, I noticed that it was starting to cave in, I figured she had been sleeping on it. Then one day I found that the entire thing had collapsed because my cat was jumping on it, I took it apart and realized that the plastic rods had snapped in half. I was so angry because I had paid so much money for this thing. My other problem was that it was so huge and ugly. I might have my dad build one out of plywood, it would be a lot sturdier than this thing and I could just decorate it myself so it would look nicer. I really like the litterbox, but I hate the tent."
35309,0,"I bought one of these so that we could go away on a long weekend and not kill my daughter's goldfish ($1 carnival prize goldfish--$25 feeder). It took me three tries to figure out the programming instructions--I agree with the others that encountered problems. I am fairly computer literate and the steps required to program the thing were ridiculous. I basically got it to work by accident. It is also not attached to the ""adjustable"" mounting bracket--it simply slides off. I found this out after carrying it across the room by the mounting bracket--it fell off and smashed into about a dozen pieces on my tile floor. So . . . it seemed to be reliable for the few days that we used it and it is relatively quiet, but if you lack technical ability or interpret ""adjustable"" as ""attached, but movable"" this may not be the feeder for you."
87925,0,"When we first installed the fountain we found it relatively quiet, but within a few days it had begun fits of louder operation -- a bit growly really. These noisy spells can be ended by lifting then replacing the reservoir housing. We have the reservoir completely full, so that's not it. Turning the pressure up or down does not seem to help, though the louder the water, the less conspicuous the motor noise. Not sure I'd buy this again. It'll have to live in the basement from here on out, since it's too loud for the dining room."
107927,2,"The comb fits alright, but I find that it frequently gets tangled in the thick, curly fur of my dog (cocker/terrier). Bought it for the Oster A5. I find the clipper works much better without the comb. Part of the problem may be that I have the #10 wide blade on my clipper, and the comb is made for the #10 regular width blade."
44642,0,"I think this is a great product. However, my finicky cat refuses to drink from it. I left it there for a month with another water bowl in a different location and she refused to use the pet fountain. I wound up giving it to a friend with 2 non-finicky cats. So, beware if your cat is attached to their water bowl."
37647,0,"The Omega is well conceived but it has one tragic flaw -- cat poop. The first time I rotated the box to dump the poop, I did not check first to see if my cats had covered their droppings. One of them hadn't. The stuff got caught in the filter grill where it became a dried mess that partly blocked the grill until I could take the box apart and hose it down. Even when the cats did cover their poop, the clumps sometimes broke up in the grill, then plopped against the top of the box as it was rotated, then fell - most of it - into the waste bin. I am back to emptying the old covered litter boxes with a hand rake while I save up for a Litter Robot."
920,1,"My Shih Tzus love the assorted rawhide twist sticks. They are a bit larger in size than the little twist sticks so I don't worry, as much, that they will choke on them. They do last for a long long time. I also like the fact that these rawhide sticks do not stain my Shih Tzus coats, carpets or bedspreads. I highly recommend them for your dog's chewing pleasure."
58252,0,"We got this for our 45lb dog and it occupied him for 30 minutes the first time we gave it to him. He had a little trouble getting a treat out. A miracle! However he is a smart dog and quickly learned how it worked. A scoop of food that used to last him 20+ minutes now only lasted him 10 minutes. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks, the plastic lid that screws onto the jug cracked and it is now useless. This is probably best for pet owners with carpeting since my dog would pick it up and drop it constantly to get the treats out which would be very noisy."
17319,0,"We purchased this collar from Amazon about 2 years ago. We had problems with it spraying when our dog didn't bark. I called the company and they sent out a new one. It worked well for awhile then it started shooting up like Old Faithful when I was filling it. The batteries also didn't last very long. We stopped using it for a year because I was frustrated with the issues we were having. I decided recently to try again, and that is when it was shooting out the Citronella as quick as I put it in. I called the company again and they said that they had recalled the model that I had so they sent out another new one. They also included spray and battery which I thought was nice of them. This collar has been working better, but when I don't have it on she barks alot. Sometimes I will put it on her without turning it on and that works. We have a new puppy so I hate to leave it on our older dog all the time since it seems to prohibit her from playing with the puppy.I am happier with this model, and like I said, ""It is better then nothing"", but I am still not getting the results I was hoping for. For those of you who complained about the unit being faulty, give Premier a call. They are really good about replacing it."
97782,0,OK but could be better. Was going to leeve it at that but need the words so I won't buy again.
189986,0,"I purchased the petmate durabed for large breeds. I have a Doberman puppy that weighs 35 lbs and he absolutely loves his bed. A concern I have is that if he weighed the actual amount that the bed says it could hold, I don't believe the product would last very long. I have to tighten the legs every couple of weeks or the bed would collapse. The bed definitely shows the wear and tear from everyday use."
205603,1,"A single foam insert costs about $3 from my local fish supply store. Buying a 3pk for just about the same price is an excellent value. The foam inserts can be used for a much longer time than the manufacturer suggests. Just rinse the insert, in conditioned water or water from the aquarium, and you are good to go until the foam insert starts to break down.Excellent value, and is easily cleaned and reused. Recommended for anyone with an AquaClear Power Filter."
107649,1,"This is my 2nd flexi - first one only failed due to my laziness--- it's best wit a well mannered, trained dog you want to keep on 'leash' but want to give some freedom. Watch your fingers!! This is improved from the model I bought 6 years ago."
96701,2,"The cats loved the other flavor, they won't touch this one. My bad, I ordered the wrong one. Love my cats"
98856,1,This collar is very well made and reasonably priced. The leather is thick but not stiff and gets softer with wear.
30479,0,I bought one of these and a Lee's net breeder. I like the Lee's brand much better than this one. The plastic is flimsy and the net even worse. I thought I was going to rip the net as I gingerly put it on the plastic frame! And I didn't get all the tiny plastic grass things -the picture shows 5 or 6 sturdy ones; I got only 3 (that also looked & felt as if they'd fall to pieces).
181108,0,"OK - but a heating pad worked better for my litter - easier to get onto - and more consistently warm. I was glad to have the Snuggle Safe just in case I needed to take the litter to the vets (or a puppy to the vets) in an emergency. Fortunately, we had no need for an emergency vet visit - The Snuggle Safe was just so rigid that it wasn't inviting."
41464,0,"My cats shed all over the place, thus, the need for a brush. This one- well, better than nothing. A friend of mine has a much better one, with longer teeth that catches more hair. The teeth on this are a little shallow and don't catch that much in the brush. They more just disturb the hair off of the feline coat. If anyone can recommend a decent one to me, I would appreciate it. Just could be designed better."
35944,0,"I think it's a good product... just didn't work for my dog. But, my dog is rather unique in that he goes insane outdoors when he sees another dog. So, not to say this product is bad. Just doesn't work with stubborn dogs like mine."
95871,0,"My dog is about 12 lbs. Her feces tends to slip through the cracks in the rake. This rake still works okay, but I will pick something else when I need a new one."
52858,2,This thing is not the sixe it said it is and the leather used is garbage . My dog got this peice of crap off in 1 minute . If you need a muzzle DO NOT BUY IT ONLINE go get one at a store so you know you have the right size
53639,0,These have a great concept...but my little dogs were able to chew chunks off of this way too easily. It's also hard to clean the inside and it got moldy...so I'll be buying the other kong products.
60324,0,"I have tried both on my dog over the last few years and have found Frontline to work much better than Advantix for keeping tics away. Frontline is much safer too for everyone because it allows the tick to stay long enough to die from the medicing whereas Advantix repells them faster, which can make disease carrying tics jump off inside your home, alive and well so from my point of view; their is not contest here."
108026,0,"It's good and it is easy to use, but it is not sharp enough and sometimes splinters my cat's nails."
97604,0,"I purchased this with the hopes that it will help me navigate my aerator pretty easily between my aquarium and my fish bowl (serves as an isolation tank when the fish are sick). I don't know if the problem was with the air pump or this kit but I had to crimp the tubes in order for the air to circulate in all of the ""slots"" .. or else it would just go to one tube and not to everything else."
140435,2,"I just bought this locally (Nov. 2012) because it offered 12 feeding perches and perhaps some squirrel resistance. I think the screen will limit gnawing if a squirrel does come aboard, but my feeder location doesn't have much trouble with squirrels.I'm more concerned about the central, plastic tube. It is made of three sections that fit together, overlapping maybe half an inch. Those friction-fit joints don't work reliably. My unit came with the tubes jammed together too far, and the central tube ended up bowed up against one side of the cage. I had to disassemble the whole thing and take several tries to put it back together to have it all look straight. I suppose it was assembled wrong at the factory, or else jammed in transit.I fear the plastic central tube may not stay where it should.Updated Jan. 2013: The good news: I watched squirrels climb around the cage and have trouble taking any seed.The bad news: This proved to be the least popular of my three feeders serving hulled sunflower seed. We have various goldfinches and larger finches (house, purple), in San Jose, California. They seemed to find it hard or unpleasant to reach far enough to take seed. Rain wet the seed through the ports and by collecting into the bottom pan. The seed grew mold, stuck together, and grew even more mold. We have a plastic-disk (frisbee-like) shield over each feeder, but this feeder had by far the most trouble with rain water.So, I've downgraded my rating and removed the feeder to try another one."
30592,1,My golden lab loves this squeaky ball. She likes the sound it makes while it is going through the air and each time it bounces. If your dog opens it up there is stuffing inside that needs to be thrown away. It is hard to chew open.
72619,1,"Both my little ones loved this item. They started scratching it immediately. I have tried to buy scratching posts, etc. and they have not liked them but this they seem to like. Would buy it again for sure."
153073,0,"I received the Cat Genie. It had some operational issues, but the company is very easy to talk to and we were able to get it up and running. The problem is it's been a month and the cats won't use it. I have worked with the company to use all the tricks to make the cats use it, and they won't. Maybe you can't teach old cats new tricks! If they would this machine is slick and you truly would never have to scoop cat litter again! But it is too expensive to have just sitting there unused by the cats. Also if you buy this item at Amazon, you only have 30 days to return it. I may have been able to get the cats to use it if I had had more time. If you buy directly from Cat Genie, it will cost you more, but you have a full 90 days to work with. So keep that in mind when deciding where to buy it!"

We settled on this bed and are so very pleased with it. Bodhi absolutely loves his new bed. He took to it right away and gets into the most comical positions we've seen yet! We were so very pleased with the immediate delivery and the price. Thank you very much for having this bed as a selection to choose from.Rick ThrasherCalifornia"
94725,0,"Our dog is not a chronic barker. She barks primarily at doorbells, door knocks, and other sounds similar to doorbells and door knocks. Hopefully if our apartment is ever broken into, the thief will ring the doorbell first.The collar functions as advertised, and for about a month it worked fairly well on my dog. We'd put it on a few minutes prior to the arrival of a friend, she'd bark one or two times when they arrived and then would quickly stop.Then she just started ignoring it and barked through the spray. Now she still barks up a storm and our apartment smells strongly of citronella. Visitors think we've been cleaning with Lemon Pledge.I can't fault the collar for not working on my dog. It seems to work well on other people's dogs (or at least they didn't wait very long before they posted their reviews).I have two complaints:* Rarely it goes off for no apparent reason. I've seen my dog just lying around doing nothing and the collar will go off.* The refills are expensive.We're going to try a shock collar next."
214980,0,"We got this for our 6 month old Great Dane puppy for Christmas. He absolutely loves it, especially since it squeaks. However, I should have paid attention to the reviewer who said to put it away after you play fetch and not to let the dog chew on it. Rocky chewed on it for about 20 minutes and worked the cover loose from the end. He's not a very aggressive chewer, either. We'll glue it back on and continue to play fetch with it, but he won't be allowed to chew on it anymore."

159815,0,"The unit appeared to work in silent mode initially. However, either the neighbor's dog got used to it or it never really worked. In audible mode, however, the unit worked wonderfully. Not only did the neighbor's dog stop, but also went away from the area. Of course, the dog's owners may not appreciate you using the unit on their pet.

21250,0,"I've been using Soft Claws for about three years now. They are little blunted caps that you fill with glue and put over your cat's front claws. When all 10 front claws are covered, they do a great job: the caps are blunt enough that when the cat tries to scratch the carpet or furniture, their claws just slide over the surface without doing any damage.They are expensive and high maintenance. I could imagine it being very challenging to apply Soft Claws to a cat who really hates having their claws messed with. After three years of practice, my cat and I have reached an understanding so that I can usually do up to three at a time without getting bitten, but I don't look forward to it. The ""thumb"" claws are the hardest ones for me to do, for some reason. The glue is like Super Glue and if you get it on your hands, which you probably will at some point, it stays there. The caps stay on for a couple of weeks; I usually have to replace 2 or 3 of them twice a week. My cat does pull at them with her teeth, but she can't pull them off and I don't think her pulling accelerates their falling off. You do have to keep up with replacing them, because even one sharp uncovered claw and they can scratch again.If you can train your cat not to scratch your furniture, that would be way easier than using Soft Claws. I wasn't able to train my cat to do that, and Soft Claws are the best option I've found -- good enough that I keep using them."
78101,0,"The material used for this protective mat is very good. However the mat itself is very small. It is barely wide enough to cover the cargo floor of my HHR, and is too short to attach over the front seats. It does stay in place with the clips on the front. It would be better if I could use it in just the very rear cargo area with the two back seats in the upright position but then my two dogs would not fit in the cargo area. Although the mat is as described it would be more useful if it were larger."
113262,2,Got this to replace the tennis ball my dog normally swims after and my dog hates this toy! Won't put it in her mouth in the house and not at all interested in swimming after it even though she loves the water. I don't know if the material tastes weird in her mouth? Total waste of money. Also - this Seller needs to improve their product detail page to give the buyer the option of selecting whatever color they want. Not all of these show up well in the water.

200080,1,"After hearing from a groomer and then reading reviews of this product, I decided to purchase one for use on our golden retriever. Brushes do not compare to this tool. It gets the undercoat that brushes cannot. I try to brush our dog out at least once a week, and when I do, the amount of hair that the ""Furminator"" is removing is absolutely amazing!! I am pulling half of a plastic grocery bag of fur off of her...how mislead I was when I was only cleaning out our dog brush three times per brushing!!! While she still sheds, the ""Furminator"" has assisted with the amount of dog hair I am cleaning up off of the floor and around her crate."
36575,0,"I just bought my second one of these, having owned the last one for 18 months.The only reason I bought this model again is the original flap was broken to the extent that the door would not stay in place and we had a hole where a door once sat. I needed a quick fix. I intend to buy a better model when my work schedule permits me to fit a different style door.The Cons:The tunnel that connects the inner and outer doors doe not attached securely, it clips together very loosely and can fall out.The tunnel attaches on the inside, and protrudes on the outside; it is not secured between the two sides. From the outside, with very little force, you can slide the tunnel out.The door flap is held in place by two very flimsy pins.The lock is easily defeated by a determined cat; one of our cats just bats its paws against it until it opens.The Pros:It comes with 3 different length sets of screws to accommodate different door thicknesses."
117149,0,I bought two of these for my kids hamsters and the one hamster does great climbing and doing everything the cage is for. The other hamster fell off the top when she started sliding and refused to go up again so now the cage is in the basement.Its also not as easy to get to your hamster since if she is in the tank you can't just open the top and reach in unless you have super long arms so you must remove the entire top which for a kid can be tough. I worry that they will not hook it right and it will get knocked off and the cats will have lunch.Often the hamster food ends up all over the place too since its set in the top part and if you are not completly steady it spills.

I never thought in a million years this could be harmful. The next morning, I woke up to hearing him throw up. I went and checked on him and sure enough, he had thrown up an ENTIRE egg. I had no idea that he could even swallow something that large! Luckily he threw it up and didn't choke on it. I immediately had to throw the toy away. I have definitely learned my lesson with giving him small chew toys. I just wanted to warn anyone with larger dogs to make sure they watch their dog the entire time they are playing with this toy and if you are not able to then you probably should not purchase this toy."

When I came back, he ate the whole thing.Next day, I cut it in half and just smeared a teensy bit of his canned food on it. Then I left the room. When I came back he again had eaten the whole thing.So, you might try this method if you didn't have luck at first. I really want him to munch on these, 'cause I've heard good things about what they can do for his 9 year old teeth.I'm gonna continue with this, gradually cutting out the ""treats"" smeared on top. And then if I can get him to eat it cut in half, I'll eventually try to get him to eat it whole."

I never used the cover it came with because my pet doesn't like anything that doesn't have a familiar feel or scent to it. I must say the disk does heat up well, and not too hot to touch, which is good. I'm looking for a softer heating pad that plugs into an outlet, and covers a wider area that won't put my kitty on a hill when he sleeps. Not sure how much luck I'll have, but I'm trying."

We also found it to be less effective; their teeth were more yellow and they developed bad breath more quickly in the few weeks that we used this product despite using electric toothbrushes with it. (They are used to electric toothbrushes so we know the toothpaste is the problem.)The tube is very small so it only lasted about 3 weeks for 2 dogs with nightly brushing.

This cat door was large enough for our new cat but doesn't appear to be cumbersome to the normal size cats. I needed to enlarge the door opening, and with the included template and clear instructions this was easy using a drill and a electric jig saw. Our door was hollow and this posed no problem as the door doesn't screw to the thin wood door, rather one half screws to the other half and sandwiches the door in between. I believe this is a better approach for a hollow door and is still fine for a solid door. The door is well made and looks good installed."

The Shih tzu with storm phobias stopped trembling and started to doze off during the ocean segment. I saw ears perk at different sounds from most. Since I can't ask them, I'm going to assume that it holds some interest for them. I think the training segments totally suck. I don't see how a dog can learn by hearing ""sit....good dog"" repeated for 10-15mins. I would think they would become numb to the words, if anything.

99718,0,"We need to order the Frontline TopSpot because our vet no longer carries this product--they only carry the Frontline Plus. I'm not sure why anyone would need the Plus product to control eggs, when the TopSpot product kills the host and therefore any eggs that would also be laid/hatch. Our dog has used TopSpot for years and has had no pest problem. In fact, we apply this product for the weight category BELOW our dog's weight and only do so every 6-8 weeks during flea/tick season. We are hesitant to apply this poison at a greater amount or frequency into our dog's bloodstream, but at the same time, topical products are not as reliable for pest control.When ordering this product online, I would like to guarantee its authenticity. I spoke to the Merial manufacturer, who said Amazon does not order the Merial Frontline products from them, and they do not sell directly to Amazon. With other supply issues on Amazon, it is impossible to find out exactly where/how Amazon is ordering this product. I would like to know where they are ordering this product so I can make a judgment on its safety and reliability. According to Merial, their U.S. manufactured Frontline products should have three things: 1) NO expiration date, 2) weight class of the animal in POUNDS on the front of the box, and 3) a lot number on the box that MATCHES the lot number on the vials.One of the Amazon reviewers said the lot number on the vials did not match the lot number on the box. This concerns me, and I am always afraid of getting a counterfeit product--especially one from China. I wish there was some way to guarantee the authenticity of this product on Amazon."

4035,0,This product is not airtight. I use it to store cat food indoors so that factor is not as important for my use. The lid can easily be separated from the container while in the closed position. There is a seal where the lid and the container touch but you can lift the lid to stick your fingers in between the lid and the container the seal doesn't do much good.The small opening on the top is great for easier access to scoop cat food out. This is the main reason I decided to not return the product. Ease of use outweighed importance of product being airtight.
158897,0,"After reading the instructions and watching the DVD, I introduced it to my 18 month old Amstaff. I let him smell it, let it hang on his nose, etc. Once I saw/thought he was comfortable with it I fitted it on him as per the instructions and DVD. I immediately noticed his demeanor changed and he seemed to mellow out right away. Then he started the clawing at his nose and finally gave up once he saw that he couldn't take it off and that I wouldn't take it off for him. Then came the walk. Before, he would immediately pull with a traditional collar. As I set out for the walk he was walking alongside me, I was impressed. Once in our walking routine I started to notice and hear his heavy, and sometimes seemed labored, breathing. I started to get a bit concerned, but as the instruction stated, ""Fit should be that you can just get one finger under the collar and it should look like a V"", which is how I fitted it on my dog. As the walk got longer, he seemed to breathe even heavier. Then came the ultimate reaction from him that made me stop using it. He all of a sudden went into a ""crocodile death roll"" in protest. The leash was wrapped around his head as well as catching his right front leg into the loops. That made me decide that this wasn't what I need to use.I will say that this product seem to work as advertised, but in my case, it isn't the right training aid for my dog to teach him not to pull. I guess it is time to do more research for other alternatives."
14368,0,Our kitten loves this toy. The only downfall is that the little mouse completely came off the orange stick within a week. He still loves playing with the balls and is pretty entertained but playing with the mouse was his favorite thing to do so he doesn't play with it as much.

However, as I have discovered in purchasing other generic products, they don't always fit the greyhound anatomy. In this instance, the narrow greyhound nose and head. Even with the included extra head strap, it wouldn't stay in place. I ended up purchasing the original doggles and so far so good. She doesn't look as chic as she did in the K9 optix but they seem to stay in place better."

121516,1,I am feeding five kittens at present and offered them three different kitten foods and they prefer this. They are presently five weeks old and the babycat34 is an excellent and well thought out product. The kibble is tiny (much smaller than any of the others I've seen) and just perfect as a starting dry food....they can eat it much more easily. If you want to start young kittens on dry food this is the stuff. It is aimed at kittens age 1-4 months and is very age targeted. It is really really great that a company has focused on such a narrow (but vital) need in this age of mass marketing.
78708,0,"Product was shipped as promised.

The thumbnail image for the XL is not how the belly strap fits under the arm pits.

The harness will slide forward, pinching the arm pits and leaving slack on the chest strap. I have to readjust his harness several times during our walk.Overall I like the Easy Walk Harness and it does what it says: keeps your dog from pulling."
163758,0,"I bought this to keep my Rottweilers out of the front seat of my Jeep GC. The Jeep has fold down seats, so I wanted to use it both behind the rear seat and behind the front seat when the rear seats are folded down.===The Good Points===* When I heard the rattles when the UPS guy delivered the box, I was waiting for disaster. However, after assembling the unit and trying it out, there are almost no rattles. The vertical poles use rubber grommets to minimize rattle, and the side wings are clamped on securely, at least so far.* Behind the back seat, the product almost works fine, subject to a few fixes. It slips in and out with no problem, and I can install or uninstall it in 2 minutes.* It is (usually) secure enough mounted behind the back seat to deter my dogs. No doubt they could push it over if they really tried, but they are more opportunists than dedicated escape artists.=== The Not-So-Good Points===* I was hoping to use the same gate when I fold down the rear seats. Here things were a bit more problematic. First, the base of the unit now sits on the folded seat back. While the seat back is a hard surface, it is sitting on top of the seat and seatback upholstery, which tends to compress. As a result, you have to keep tightening the gate so that it doesn't fall over. It takes about 30 min or so of tightening until the seat upholstery fully compresses. A length of 1x4 across the whole seat back spreads out the force and makes the problem a little more manageable.* The other problem with a hehind-the-front-seat installation is the gap between the bottom of the gate and the console between the front seats. It is just large enough to tempt a dog, and once they get underneath it, it falls over pretty easily (albeit with 90 pounds of canine muscle).I contacted the manufacturer, and they suggested adding thisGMI PetShield Bucket Seat Tubular Travel Barrier. Unfortunately the way my seats and center hump are on the Jeep, this really won't work. I plan on adding another piece of grating to the bottom of the existing grate, just enough to discourage nosy dogs.=== Things I Fixed===* The tension between the floor and ceiling is governed by how much you tighten two thumbscrews on threaded rods. The problem is that these will loosen as your car vibrates while traveling. My first solution was to add another nut below the thumbscrew to keep it snug. This sort of worked, although it would still work its way loose.The better solution was to put a small clamp on the thumbscrew that wedged itself next to the backseat. The clamp I used was one of the $1 cheapo plastic ones that are often on the checkout counter at Home Depot. The prevented the thumbscrew from turning.* The gate would also shake itself loose, no matter how tight I made the screws. The solution was to bungee the gate to the back seat headrests. It didn't have to be too tight, just enough to keep the gate from vibrating towards the front and back of the vehicle and working its way loose.* It is sometimes hard to really tighten the gate in place, because the threaded rod will rotate inside the sleeves/feet. So instead of tightening the thumbscrew, you end up just rotating the whole threaded rod, which doesn't tighten anything. Keeping a pair of channel-lock pliers handy fixes this problem.=== Summary ===I really had two applications in mind for this product- mounting behind the front seat and mounting behind the back seat. I'd call it a 2 star performer behind the front seat-it just doesn't seem to stay installed without being at least partially supported by the back seat. Mounting it behind the back seat-maybe a 3 or 3 1/2 star deal. It sort of works now, but definitely did not work the way it came out of the box.Overall I am disappointed, but it is just serviceable enough to keep."

14893,2,"My review is not for the product, but for the seller - BUYER BEWARE!The product PHOTO shown above is for Bayer K9 Advantix II. The photo you'll see when you add this product to your cart is for K9 Advantix II. What you'll actually receive from the shipper is K9 Advantix, which Bayer stopped manufacturing in March of 2011. I contacted the seller, asking about the discrepancy and was told ""The photo is NOT of K9 Advantix II, it is just the new packaging they have for the regular K9 Advantix"", prompting me to contact Bayer directly, describing the packaging I received. Bayer actually stopped manufacturing K9 Advantix in March of 2011 and went to K9 Advantix II (pictured above). The difference is the newer product kills flea EGGS, while the original product does not. While I read the description of the product, the photo itself is PURPOSELY misleading and it was until I received the shipment and checked my purchase history, that the photo of the old product appeared.Since my concern is ticks, not fleas, and as there is no expiration date on the product, I will use it rather than go thru the hassle of returning and repurchasing. Bayer did say there was no harm in using it also. I simply feel the seller here is mis-leadng an their fOllow-up email proves it, as they are trying to claim new product packaging....I'll continue to purchase this product online - just NOT FROM THIS SELLER."

My dog doesn't seem thrilled by it if he's excited, but he does seem to enjoy sleeping in it once he's calmed down. This thing is HUGE - definitely something to keep in mind if you drive a car as opposed to a van or SUV. I am able to wedge it into the backseat of my Regal - but it is wider than a single seat in back, it fits much better in my husbands Taurus. Also because of the massive size of this thing I can't even open and close the drawer in it because it is butted up against the front seat essentially."

43202,0,"So I picked this stuff up at the pet store and brought it home. Tidy Cats wasn't doing it anymore with the addition of the second cat. After adding it, I sneezed for a few days. My eyes were puffy, and I kept leaving the house for air. I kept using it because the stuff is to expensive I didn't want to waste it! After a few days the scent died down and the litter did its thing. I couldn't smell a thing from the litter box. I'm not a scoop every day person. I scoop when I smell the box, which was usually about 2 or 3 days before. With this stuff, well. I'm almost embarrassed to say how long I went without scooping. I don't have a scoop schedule, so... when I started smelling it 10 or 14 days later I just went ahead and replaced all the litter. So I'm not saying you should forget to scoop for two weeks like I did, but if you go by the ""when I can smell it"" system, you might need to come up with a schedule! Only getting unscented from now on, which works just as well and doesn't leave my nose and eyes irritated."

168251,0,"Because these collars are round, they're reflective from every angle, which is great. And when I say ""reflective"", I mean reallyREALLY reflective, which is also great. The reflective tape is woven through the whole collar, and there's lots of it, so it really picks up the light when I'm out walking my dogs at night.I would've given them a perfect rating, except for the fact that the collars are a lot bigger than they're supposed to be. The size is stated as 19""-24"", but even when it's buckled at the tightest notch, the collar is still a little over 27"", which is so big that they can slide easily over the heads of my two 75-lb Golden Retrievers. So it's a great collar for night-safety purposes, but really bad for dog-restraint purposes.The collars so inexpensive that it didn't seem worth the trouble to return them, so when I take the dogs out at night, I just slip the reflective collars on along with their regular collars, kind of like a necklace rather than a dog collar, which actually works pretty well. So overall, I'd recommend the collars pretty highly - just order a size a lot smaller than you think you'll need, or plan to use it mainly as a decorative accessory."
10294,0,"We bought this cage about a year ago at a major pet retailer to house our two gerbils. It lasted almost exactly one year, and then on Saturday one of the gerbils chewed through one of the top plugs and made a cunning escape. Luckily we caught him later that day (which really surprised me) but we're off to buy a new, chew-proof cage. I actually didn't dislike this cage as much as most of the other reviewers, but there are some definite pros and cons:PROS:- It's a cute cage, with lots of space for 2 gerbils to live comfortably.- The top ""handling area"" is pretty nice - my childrens' gerbils love it, and often spend a lot of the day up there sleeping. It's often an easy way to corral them when I'm cleaning the cage - I just wait until they're up there and take the whole top unit out, block the exit, and leave them there until I'm done.- I personally don't think it's that hard to clean once you get the hang of it. My husband did break a tube the one time he cleaned it, but it was because he attempted to put in the tubing incorrectly. Once I figured out how to do it I could get the cage emptied and completely cleaned out and reassembled in 15 minutes.- The wire portion of the cage is very strong and well made - stronger than the other cages we're looking at now.- You can buy lots of accessories for this cage on Amazon and at major pet retailers.CONS:- I feel that the plastic absorbs some liquid waste and gets an odor after a while. I don't know if this is actually the case or not, but I've noticed a slight odor that doesn't go away after I clean the cage. I'm very sensitive to smells so it may be just my imagination.- The cage is chewable, hence the escape. It took my two gerbils a year to chew through, but they're my first rodent pets so others may chew through faster.- The bars start fairly low on the cage, so LOTS of litter gets thrown out of the cage. We use the Carefresh compressed paper litter, but I tried granular and it was a mess-fest. I have to use my hand-vac about every 2-3 days to clean up around the cage area.- There are lots of extra ports for accessories, so lots of areas to chew and eventually escape from.So all in all I didn't hate this cage, but I won't buy another one of this brand. We're switching to an aquarium tank-topper cage in the hopes that it solves some of our problems. I guess we'll see!"

115288,0,"I bought the large containers after reading the reviews about the small ones not holding 40 lb bags of food. I have 2 dogs that eat different kinds of food so I needed 2 containers and wanted stackable ones due to space constraints. I thought these would work great but they will not hold the weight of a full container stacked on top of them. Not only did the top of the lower container start buckling, but since I thought maybe I had them seated wrong and had my husband push out the buckled one and switch them, now both have buckled and neither one's lid will close properly so they are no longer airtight. If you are just buying one or will not be stacking them they will probably work great for you but if you are buying them for their stacking capabilities, look elsewhere."
206741,2,"I've had this pump for about 10 days and it's been running fine. I did a water change today in preparation for a vacation I'm taking this week. After changing the water I turned on the pump and it didn't work. It's a tight fit in my sump, so it's not easy getting it in/out. I got it out, checked it again in a bucket of water, and got nothing. I could hear and feel it humming, but no pumping. I dismantled it and checked it out. Being just 10 days old it was very clean. I reassembled it, and viola! It worked! I wedged back into my sump, started it up again, and nothing. Long story short, third time's a charm. It's working now, but for how long? Very unsettling. I guess you get what you pay for."
65960,2,"My wife is nervous about clipping our spaniels' nails and bought this at petco today. These reviews are consistent... the red light stays on, even when you can clearly see that it's in a safe zone (I'm actually good at nail clipping and would never have bought this thing.) And, true to other comments, it's not sharp enough to actually function as a clipper, even if you know what you are doing without the lights working.Don't waste your money. Instead, find a clear nail with the quick easily visible, get some good quality clippers (read: sharp!) and start slowly from back to front, preferably with the blade away from the dogs foot. Slowly shave off a miniscule amount of the harder nail tip; like shaving parmesan cheese. Once you get a thin slice off, you can slowly take more thin slices. Don't overdo it. As you begin to clip more regularly, the quick will withdraw back into a shorter nail over time. Then, match the amount you've shaved with the amount you would take off the darker, opaque nails.It's also helpful if the nails are a little soft, like after a bath. If you don't overdo it, your dog will get used to it. If you go too far and hurt them, they will have a tough time letting you do it again."
58272,2,I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him. He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.

97253,1,I had purchased this Khaki Classic Cratewear set years ago from a local pet store and it was great! This is a must if you have your crate inside it provides a den like place for your dog to relax in and it looks nice. This fabric washes well so if you have the need to clean it don't worry follow instructions. After checking the pet stores in the area I was unable to locate this Cratewear until I checked on Amazon and found it not only in the size I needed but it cost about $30.00 less!
99926,1,"Awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup/dog. My two pekeingese just love these. You can use them for training as well as just a treat. They come in a variety of flavors. My pups like the liver the best. For senior dogs, these are perfect if they don't have the ""jaw"" power or teeth use anymore. They are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood. They are just 3 calories each so you don't have to worry about their weight. Absolutely recommend these to every dog owner!"
153045,1,"I just received my Cat Genie three days ago, and I already love it! I have two cats that are 5 and 6 years old. The younger one took to it immediately and, let me tell you, there is nothing comparable to not having to scoop poop! My other cat hasn't used it yet but is very curious. He smells it every time he needs to go and then goes in his old box. But it's only been set up for two days, so I am still optimistic. And I love the sanitizing solution. It makes my whole house smell clean. So not only have I gotten rid of the smelly, dusty clay litter, but my house smells even cleaner without any effort from me! I have had none of the problems that were reported in earlier reviews, but it sounds like those were solved by the company already. I highly recommend this product if you never want to scoop poop again!"

145041,2,I have an Italian Greyhound that likes to find the seam in a carpet and pull it so she unravels the carpet. I got this hoping I could spray areas and she would leave it alone. I have light colored carpet and I didn't want to have to put chili pepper all over. Well she didn't like the smell in the bottle so I thought that was promising but when I sprayed it she didn't care and kept pulling at the carpet. When you read the bottle is sounds more like it is to keep them from licking them selves.

196090,2,This toy is huge. My cat is 16 pounds and this is so much bigger than him. It takes up a good amount of space for being a cat toy. Some of the toys are too high up. He only played with the ones that hang down lower. I threw it away after a week. The Panic Mouse is a much better interactive cat toy.

196853,0,"I put my 4 gerbils in this playpen (actually ordered two to make it bigger) with newspaper under it and left to go clean their cage. When I walked in again after, I saw one of them running around on the floor- thank goodness the other 3 were still in there and I had the door closed, otherwise by-by gerbils; and we have a cat. I was impressed at how large the playpen was ( I could lay down in the two playpens attached and still have about a foot of open space.) ( I am about 5'6""), but the playpens are very short. A guinea pig is shown on the cover of the box in the playpen, but on the back it says the playpen is suitable for gerbils and hamsters...how does this work? No way would I put gerbils/hamsters in it unattended let alone guinea pigs, because normal adult guinea pigs can stand up taller than the playpen. The only way I would purchase this is if I had dwarf hamsters. The bars seem close enough together nd they wouldn't be abl to climb it. Now I have to return it."
167435,0,"After reading some of the other reviews I decided to try this product on some urine stains that I had discovered after they had been dried for several weeks. I totally saturated the stains and let the product set overnight and then blotted them up. I was disappointed to find that I could still smell a faint urine smell. And if I could then I KNOW my dog could. Perhaps it works well on fresh puddles that you can blot up and then treat, but it is no cure-all for old stains."

63542,0,I needed something to hang my Zoo Med combo lamp fixture from. This looked good on the site but in reality it's not as well made as it could be. I'm sure it would be fine for a single lamp but it's hard to keep the lamp balanced. It was very easy to set up although I wish the bottom platform had a way to attach to the tank. It just sets under the tank and I have my tank set up on small feet as I have a heating pad underneath for the winter time as well.

154570,0,"With no bottom connecting the sides, the Scoop Free unit is essentially a rectangular frame. The disposable litter pan fits in the center of the frame and rests on the floor. If the unit is not on a level surface, the disposable pan does not fit properly in the frame: the rake (or part of the rake) either gets stuck in or moves over the top of the litter. I did not have this problem with my Litter Maid - Litter Maids have their own bottoms, so there are no fitment issues. I like the premise of the Scoop Free unit. I wish that the Scoop Free had a solid bottom and that the disposable pan were placed on top of it. The solid bottom would make the unit rigid enough to be used on unlevel surfaces. It would also protect floors in the event that the litter pan became saturated. ."
142583,2,"On paper, this is a great invention. No more daily litter clean up, right? Wrong. The rake thing is constantly getting stuck, and inevitably it's in the middle of the night, so we have to get up and get it unstuck. My cats don't like the noise it makes, and I think they've gotten scared of it, since one of them has started to poop just outside of the box, and the other one started to pee on the bathroom rug (he's 5 years old, and has never had a problem before). So I switched back to my old litter box, and the litter problems have gone away. I still have the littermaid, but neither of my cats will step one paw in it. Plus, Littermaid insists you use their brand of litter, and I think it's one of the worst clumping litters I've ever used. It has NO odor control, so I'm almost glad my cats have stopped using it."
73531,2,I was a groomer for 4 yrs before I became a stay-at-home-mom. I still have a few family dogs (and my husband) that i give haricuts to. I needed another 7 blade and so I bought this one. I went to shave my husbands head and this blade left so many uncut hairs I was afraid I had put on an old blade accidentally. It was the brand new one and it did a terrible job of evenly cutting my husbands hair. I did keep it for a labradoodle I groom just as the beginning blade to us to get the majority off but I was not pleased in the overall clipping of this blade.
143165,0,"After reading many reviews of this litter box, I knew not to expect a miracle product. The LitterMaid meets my expectations in that it does what it says it will do, but there are some little glitches occasionally. I do wish it waited longer than 10 miutes before cleaning because I think that would give more time for ""clumping"". [I do use premium litter]. Sometimes the litter clumps stick to the rake and need to be pushed off with the hand scooper. I find that it works best for me to use a conventional litter box also. I have two cats, and at least the LitterMaid cuts down considerably on how often I have to scoop! It's a decent product; just don't expect perfection. UPDATE 7/9/07 [original review in May]: I finally figured out what llitter works the best: It's Arm & Hammer High Performance- natural and light weight! Try it."
110266,0,Bought these for my Aussie and my Springer Spaniel... Neither of them were interested in the lighter colored bones but both of them love the dark one which is still getting use almost a month later...
155578,2,I ordered the product about 30 days ago and it said they had the product available and would ship within 3 days. Then it got postponed week after week and now finally got cancelled...Not a really positive experience.David
7305,1,"I've been through MANY litter boxes, and this one is just great. My cats got used to it very quickly and it has really reduced the amount of litter I have to sweep up. I also no longer have to clean up after one cat who doesn't have great aim (she always aims high, so there would be urine between the box and the lid of my old litter boxes). I've never really done the liner thing because they are so expensive, but I read on another site that you can use 30 gallon trash bags instead of buying the liners. I tried it out, and they fit and work perfectly (I've been using outdoor bags since they are thicker than kitchen bags). I highly recommend this box!"

Also include drops of oxine in the waterers to keep spread of bacteria down. Can be used to clean eggs, clean all animal confinement areas, added to incubator water to prevent bacteria penetration in hatching eggs. 200 times stronger than bleach, yet safe for drinking!"
9602,1,"In my 55 gal tank I have a large Oscar, Jack Dempsey and 3 Red Hook Silver Dollars. After a long time of feeding them flakes and clouding the tank (more than it needs to be), I switched to these pellets and have no plans of going back. Even though my Red Hook's aren't cichlids, they devour these. My Oscar and JD love these pellets and do not like to share. I've also noticed considerable growth and more depth in color after switching. I like the fact they float and not get wasted. Definitely will try other Hikari pellet foods in the future. This is definitely a quality item!"
198111,0,"This is a fantastic idea, however, it will not stay attached to the shower wall. I've tried many tricks to get it to stay to no avail. I notice on the product photo there are 3 suction cups, mine has only two. Maybe that's the problem"

49669,1,"With 5 hunting dogs, what a hassle it has been for years to remove those damn ticks. Some you can't feel right away & some you can. 50-50 chance of removing the whole ugly tick. When that head stays attached what a bugger it is to remove. Our dogs were, to say the least, very uncomfortable with us using those sharp tweezers to get the head out.Not to mention how it hurt to remove those ticks from us as well. Try to pull a tick from a kids stomach with that sharp metal point. See what kind of reaction you will get. With all the tick diseases out now it is very important to remove them quickly. We tried all the methods we got from our families and friends who swore these worked - soap on a cotton ball & let it soak, alcohol on a cotton ball & let it soak, even lighter fluid on a cotton ball. These manner of removal were not accurate. Nothing seemed to work all the time then....................Along comes this spoon. Well, what a lifesaver. Works EXACTLY as it states. Used it on all our animals and ourselves as well. No muss, no fuss. Works every single time. It really does. Simply. Cost effective too. This is much cheaper than going to the emergency room to have a doctor remove the head. Eww.Trust me. Our dogs do. So do the kids."
207128,1,I needed a bowl for my dog's crate that she wouldn't be able to tip over or chew up. This bowl fits the bill. It stays out of her lounging space and she leaves it alone. It seems sturdy and surprisingly better quality than I was expecting at this price.

7736,0,"I love the Clevercat system, and so does my kitty. But, the liners are much too short! I wish they were longer and able to drape more over the sides - when you fill with litter (I use Feline Pine), you have to stretch the liner so you can put the cover on top. My husband tapes the liner to the box so it doesn't fall. We've tried garbage bags in a pinch, and they're ok, but sometimes have odor shields and stuff I don't want my cat around.These rip fairly easily - my boy looooves to bury his deposits, and he frequently shreds the liners. Would love to see something stronger and less expensive!"

159797,0,"OK, so I saw this after searching for something to quiet the neighbor dog's incessant barking at all hours of the night and it seemed like a great idea. However, it seems to suffer from mixed reviews and I suspect that it's because it is such a small and under-powered device. Imagine trying to annoy your neighbors by cranking up a small handheld radio. It just doesn't quite cut it. The thing is probably like a gnat in the dog's ear, so it may get the idea or it may not.So I considered other possibilities and discovered what I feel is a better idea: download a free tone generator app for your phone/iPad/computer and hook up the audio out to a real stereo. Then string a speaker just outside the door aimed at the neighbor's house. When the dog barks, blast the tone at high volume (the 16kHz - 17 kHz range worked best for me, but YMMV). The app lets you dial in a frequency from 1Hz to 20 kHz and just play it (note that you wont hear anything above about 14 kHz, but the dog still will ). The app i found was called Simple Sine in the Apple store, but there are a few other free ones as well ... search for tone generator. Anyway, it's worked wonders for me. I'm guessing this thing sounds more like a freight train than a gnat in the ear. I started out thinking I'd have to do this for weeks to get real results, but after one day of playing it when it barks, the dog which used to bark practically all day and night is now quiet as a mouse. I seriously haven't heard a peep out of it for two whole days.Anyway, like I said ... this thing seems like a great idea, but thought I'd offer another suggestion for those who may have a bigger problem that this doesn't handle. Also note that if you go this route, only do it while the dog is barking. The idea is to train the dog and not just be cruel and annoy/confuse it. Hope this helps someone."

I have had much difficulty peeling some disks. In some instances I couldn't get the backing off the sticky disk at all. In total I have had 4 NG disks and returned 3 disks. 4 out of 40 in total is not acceptable."

78092,2,"My 25 lb. cocker/eskimo had this toy shredded in less than a day. Granted, she does tend to chew her toys up, but I wrongly assumed from the other reviews that this one just might last....not so!!! If your dog tends to chew up toys, this is not the toy for you!"
143823,1,"Hello, plenty of people have reviewed this positively and I agree with all of them. I ended up getting one of the slightly noisy ones when I started it up (vibrating and stuff). I read some other solutions where they said to take off the motor, pull out the impeller and generously lubricate the shaft. I was worried at first because it sounded complicated since I'm not mechanically savvy, but it literally took less than a minute to do (the motor has a half twist to pop it off and then the impellar can just be pulled right off the shaft to reveal it). I did that and it worked like wonders. It's now a very quiet hum and has been like that for the past week (I've only had my tank for a week, I'm a newby to this). I used petroleum jelly to lubricate mine. I've read that it's biosafe. Another option is silicon lube. They say silicon lube is better because petroleum jelly can degrade certain kinds of rubbers (like latex condoms). Still I've read of people using petroleum jelly for years on their filters with no problem, and it was the only thing I had so I'm fine using it."

83643,2,It does the job but it's certainly not the best scoop on the market. It's so poorly made that when you bring both together to pick it up they dont line up. Then the metal is so thin that if you hit the ground the tines will bend.
106972,1,"Since my new kitten Meesa loves to run outside the minute we open the door, I felt she was adventurous enough to venture outside in a stroller. She also cries when I leave her alone and so the only solution seems to be to take her with me when I leave the house to go walking or to go get the mail.Both cats were very curious about this new object as it sat in the living room. I pretended it didn't exist for a few days and then started to put each cat in the stroller and left the zipper panel open so they could get in and out and not feel trapped. Once you go outside you will appreciate the safety the zipper panel provides. Your cat will be spared the inconvenience of being chased by dogs, that type of thing.So, after a few days, Meesa was ready to go outside. Since she was used to the stroller, she felt safe. I put her mouse toy in the stroller and lined the base with a soft towel. We then ventured out to get the mail. She was in bliss. Not only could she view everything from the safety of her mesh viewing window, she could also see me through the top opening and see out the sides. So, no matter if she was sitting, laying down or looking back at me, she felt safe.My main concern was that being in a stroller would cause her too much stress. I know how cats seem to dislike suddenly being put in new environments. It seems Meesa is rather adventurous.The Happy Trails Pet Stroller Features: Shock absorbers in the front wheels, 4 Pet viewing windows, Front Entry with Zipper, Waterproof Material, Top opening to view pet and a One-Hand Fold Mechanism for folding the stroller easily in half.If you are taking the stroller with you on a trip, it will store flat. Unfolds again in an instant. You will also enjoy the Ergonomic handle.Other features for your convenience:Parent-Tray for water/keys, leash, etc.Waterproof tray on the inside base of stroller - can be removed for cleaningLarge storage basket - You could use this for going on a picnic and taking lunch if you are heading to a park. Also useful if walking down to the mailbox or for carrying around cat toys or other kitten luxuries.The only thing I was worried about when I ordered this stroller was the handlebar. I wasn't sure if it was expandable. This might be an issue if you are very tall or want to stand further back from the stroller. I found I could easily push the stroller from the side while walking or walk behind the stroller without any problem. They could improve this item by allowing the user to adjust the handle bar position and length.Assembly: To assemble this item all you do is take the stroller out of the box and then you attach the wheels. Now, if only the instructions matched what is in the box. Fortunately it was easy enough to figure out, although I do think they need to update assembly instructions for the wheels immediately if not sooner. It seems they updated the design, but are still using an older pamphlet. I did not find a collet or a collet cover, but another metal ""hair-pin-like"" object that fastened the wheel onto the axle very easily. Like putting a hairpin through a metal bar with a hole in it. So, that was easy enough.Once you get the wheels on, there is a tiny hubcap. Once the rear wheels are attached to the rear axle, you just slide the rear axle onto the frame until it clicks and locks. The front wheels are already assembled and all you have to do is basically remove the covers and press the wheels onto the front of the frame base. Assembly took me about 10 minutes max.Suitable for pets up to 33 lbs - cats and dogs or I'd imagine other pets who love to get out of the house now and then.Very lightweight - easy to push with one hand8"" wheels - Perfect on rugged terrain and the shock absorbers make the ridemore comfortable.Fully lined canopy made from 600 Denier waterproof material - walk rain or shine.Easy to store, fold or take with you when you travelReplaceable parts - See the website for customer service.To minimize wear and tear, they suggest you keep all moving parts in the wheels lubricated with WD40, but they make a note about not lubricating the brake components or swivel locks.For Pets Only - perfect for older pets, new kittens, puppies, small dogs and other small animals.My new kitten and I love this stroller and I think you will enjoy this product. Now I look forward to going outside for more walks because I don't have to worry about Meesa getting lonely. She likes to be within 4 feet of wherever I am these days and follow me around like a puppy. She is currently sleeping on the desk in her comfy kitten bed. Eventually I'll train Meesa to deal with a leash so she can get out of the stroller when we arrive at our destination.Most pleased with this purchase!~The Rebecca Review"
196270,0,"my Eclipse Hex 5 is my favorite as I also have the 5 gallon corner Eclipse, the 12 gallon and another Hex, but there is no feeding door like the Hex and I like to let my gases excape also through that door and no contaminate seem to get in.. but the 12, 6, 5 corner and the 3 .. do not have this little extra that I like. After using a different system on my first try, I ended up with all dead fish and a soured tank. I will buy nothing else than the Marineland's tanks with the bio wheel. My tanks stay crystal clear and they are all easy to clean, vacume, and admire. Only big problem I am dealing with is the 12 gallon as the filter is not sized right and my water just runs over the top and back out without the cleaning that is so excellent in my other smaller Eclipes ..3 others. So what I did is buy a reasuable nylon bag .. add extra media .. as I had never had problems with amonia until the 12 .. so I added ammo lock with carbon into the bag, put on the bottom and now it seems .. still not sure as I just did this yesterday after getting bad readings .. but it looks like the filter is up highter and catching the icky stuff like the Hex. My hex has never had a bad reading so I know it is a great filtration system for this beginner."

7742,0,"This is a review for the Clevercat Top Entry Litter Box Liners - not the litter box. I like the box, but the liners are nothing special. I bought these thinking I needed them because they are specially sized. Unfortunately they don't stand up to extensive scratching and are easily torn.I was pre-lining the litter box with heavy duty garbage bags because these liners were always shredded when it came time to change out the box. Now I just double line with heavy duty garbage bags and skip the Clevercat liners all together. I have found this to not only be less expensive, but also more effective as the cats don't always completely shred the first layer of bag anymore since the garbage bags I am using are much stronger.Get the box, don't buy the bags. You don't need them."

81418,0,"hmm where do i start with this one. BE CAREFUL. This is not a life jacket, like for people. I have chihuahua's and they arent the best of swimmers. i had one of my dogs get turned upside down for a second in one and he freaked of course and paniced. we had to grab him. it needs more boyancy on the chest to keep thier head up. the dog does not realize he will stay afloat. so they swim thier little hearts out and can exhauset themselves and can go under with this vest. just enough to drown. i bought the same version locally. little dogs arent meant for water-they do not have the boyancy like a big dog and cant take tides-surf-currents-rapids-swells- etc.....So dont think this will keep your dog up long time- it will for long enough to grab them (thank god) and buys you the time to turn around in boat or backup. i had one jump off poontoon boat without one and i ran grabbed her skin to save her while the boat was running (split second timing) so thats why i bought one.i am an avid boater/dive instructor and breed chihuahua's. now if they only made a dive outfit -lol"

22503,1,"I have three cats, and this grooming tool works well on all of them. It works especially well on the one who sheds the most. I was really shocked at how much hair this got off of my cats. I am trying to use it more often to get them accustomed to it, as none of them really like being brushed in general. In just a few brush strokes (often, the most I can get in a sitting) yields a good handful of hair, mostly undercoat. One evening when my heaviest shedder was being particularly cooperative, I got a softball-sized ball of hair off of him, and I could pet him without getting covered in hair for about a week or two. I definitely recommend this grooming tool. There is a clear reduction in the amount of shedding and hair on my furniture, carpets, clothes, etc. None of my kitties had hairball issues (probably from the kind of food I give them), but I expect if your kitty is plagued with hairballs, this would help with them too."

109047,0,I purchased this collar for my 50lb Lab. Since the description said it was for a &lt;40lb dog I purchased it thinking it would run a little big. Turned out that I was too right. I have the collar as tight as it will go and it still only makes contact with her neck 40% of the time. She barks right outside my window every night and when it does hit she is quiet the remaining duration of the night. I recommend changing the description to size of neck range along with weight of dog.
10258,2,"We purchased one of these cages before we started raising dwarf hamsters extensively. It was difficult to clean and would come apart everywhere and have to be pieced back together every time. A couple pieces broke too soon and too easily. We did not use the water bottle - it is hard to see the water level and I am not sure they get enough water using it. It is also hard to get a hamster out to play. We quit using this cage but I did take it out to put a new hamster in one night. The hamster got out at the point where the wire curves and died at the paws of our cat. At the point of this curve the wire is too flexible and bends easily. The entire cage is too flimsey and should be better quality with stronger wire and plastic as well as better fittings. I feel this cage is too small for a Syrian and the bars are too far apart and too flexible for a dwarf. I would suggest an aquarium with a hinged lid, a Silent Spinner wheel, a dish, and a hanging water bottle which will run around $40 total. The kids can make other things for the hamsters with legos or disposable items with cardboard. We save all our paper towel and toilet paper tubes. As breeders we have used several types of cages - this one went into the garbage."
44441,0,"First: my 2 cats and 1 small dog love this! They are drinking much more water now than they did from their bowls, and they go to the fountain often. I think one of my cats just likes to watch the little waterfall.I'd owned this (the jumbo size) for a few weeks before it started gurgling loudly. Adding more water seemed to mostly fix it, giving the sound more of an ""indoor water feature"" quality. Then, tonight, 6 weeks into ownership, the fountain began the (previously unbeknownest to me) infamous leak. No visible damage or cracks, and I've been keeping it filled and relatively clean (ie, have only dissembled and scrubbed it once, but I always remove anything I see floating in the bowl). After failing to figure out where the water was leaking from (and a lot leaked in a short time...about 1/3 of the basin emptied onto my hardwoods in 30 minutes), I immediately googled it and tried out the suggestions I found there.Had the power cord been jostled during a cleaning, causing the water to trickle down it? No...Had I put it back together incorrectly, so the parts weren't perfectly aligned? I adjusted it carefully; it still leaked.Had I tried removing the filter? I...hadn't realized that was an option. I removed the filter; instantly, the fountain was silent and the leak stopped.Obviously, Petmate is serious when they ask you to change the filter monthly. I'd rinsed it out a few weeks ago, and figured I would change it soon. I'll update if adding a (new, clean) filter causes it to begin leaking again, but for now, removing the filter entirely has fixed the problem."

Although it's dusty, I don't think it's any worse than any others. It clumps better and my litter box has less pieces that fall thru the cracks. Plus, the scent is much better than any other litter. I tried all sorts of litters...newspaper, corn, and other clay and clumping litters. This beats all of them."

147520,0,"I purchased this for my growing puppy a month ahead of time. Very cute on her, but the fit isn't perfect. For the size of dog they recommended it for, it fits lengthwise (neck to rump), but not so much width wise (around the stomach). The belt that goes around the neck and stomach area are a little big. It could use some additional velcro on the sides to hold on the somewhat oversized belt. I will probably rig something up myself. For the cost you can find it on Amazon, it's still worth the price."
196894,1,"I bought this bottle to replace one of the types that you opened the top to fill. Needless to say this bottle is 10 times better than the other, no more changing bedding every 2 or 3 days because my guinea pigs are floating away with the excess water spillage.The bracket leaves a little to be desired it isn't extremely sturdy and the bracket itself will not hold the bottle up, the metal tube needs to rest on something in order for the bottle not to slide out of the bracket. I found this out when I wanted to mount the bottle inside of the cage and not the outside. I got around this by super gluing a couple of thick plastic washer to the back side of the bottle, now it can't slide and the bracket holds it up.The bottle holds a good amount of water I am not sure it is really 32 ounces though. Between my two guinea pigs I would estimate that it would last more than a week before I ""needed"" to refill it. All in all it is a good bottle, the bottle itself is made of durable plastic and it really doesn't have issues with leaking or dripping."

184443,0,This is a standard Premier leash with about 12 - 18 inches of glow in the dark/reflective tape sown on one side of the leash. I would have preferred the tape to be on both sides to increase visibility from more angles. We use this leash at night and our regular leash during the day. I'm not sure how long the reflective tape will last. Being placed close to the clasp means it is closer to the dog's head and less likely to be bent and broken off. The glow fades rather quickly once it has been charged by light.PROS:- reflective tape reflects well- placed near dog's headCONS:- tape only on one side of the leash- tape only 12 - 18 inches long- tape not long enough to show where the human is- glow fades quicklyIf it is on sale and you want a little more visibility at night then this leash may do the trick. I think a reflective collar may be a better idea as it would work from more angles.
205733,0,"I had one of the original dog doors from before this company changed hands, it was solid grey, with no window. They were robust, and still work beautifully.I bought another one for a dog house, brown with plexiglass inner door, a few years ago, and it wasn't as good as the original grey one. Lighter weight, and didn't seem to seal as well.This is my third one - building a dog door for my patio slider. The basics are still there - but much more flimsy then the brown one.

My 2 cats went in the same location in the pan, so the receptacle overflowed after one day. Also, the rake would pull the clump and litter away and then they would urinate on a pan without litter! Not a good smell! This did not liberate me from cleaning the box, I was dealing with litter box issues twice as often!(...) PS: Don't bother with the privacy tent. It wraps UNDER the tray, so when litter misses the receptacle it is trapped in the tent and you can't easily get it out. What a pain."

When I filled the bottle about 3/4 full with water, and carried it on my shoulder with the strap, the bottle fell off. The screw top isn't strong enough to hold the top with strap to the bottle. The result: the bottle falls off and spills all the water. It might work better if it had a fanny pack type waist carrying strap."
17081,0,"This is my first citronella anti-bark collar. It works fine to curb the barking of the dog wearing it. However, it corrected/sprayed my dog when he was playing with my child and my child squealed in delight at what a good dog he was being. That was the first spray my dog experienced. I was extremely upset to discover that the microphone will spray my dog for any loud noise near his neck. If you own two dogs that bark when they play or if you have a neighbor's dog that can get close to yours through a wrought iron, chain link, or picket fence, your dog can get corrected/sprayed when that neighboring dog barks at yours. I guess in that case it would be okay, because it would be teaching your dog to stay away from the fence when the dog is barking, preventing any fence barking/fighting. I just reserve it for times when my dog will NOT have the chance to be corrected by a person's voice or the bark of a dog he's playing with. That was sad and very unfair.

152968,0,"First of all let me tell you I've used litter maid, litter robot, litter free (the first generation cat genie that went broke) and now I'm on my third Cat Genie. While I must say that Gat genie is by far the best product of them all, the unit seems to last only about a year before its starts making trouble for you. I've had the bowl flooded, the hopper and the genie hand stuck more times than I care to remember.To be clear, while the unit is functional it works great and you basically can forget that your cats use it, sometimes you go a whole months without having to deal with it. The stench when the unit is flushing is pretty bad. The pellets get all over the house. Get used to it. Even the beds... That lets you know where your cats sleep while you're not home.When the unit gets stuck it is just REPUGNANT. The smell is unbearable. Even with gloves it makes you want to throw up. I've noticed that the rod inside the hopper is quite sharp. I know it has to be to breakdown the poo and everything else that the cats have swallowed but its sharp enough to cut skin. Imagine my surprise when I felt removed my hand and noticed blood coming through the glove. Pretty scary to have cat poo on an open wound. I have to wash it really good alcohol, and triple antibiotics and then a visit to the doctor just to be safe. I was given a strong oral antibiotics for a week just to prevent any infections. Thankfully nothing happened but I'm sure I could have gotten a serious infection if I had not gone to that extent.The toll free number at customer support is always busy. I've never been able to reach them and I've been a customer for years. You might wonder why I keep buying products from them. Well the answer is really simple I cant stand cleaning litter boxes and while flawed this is still the best solution available. Either they are extremely busy handling all complaints,which is very scary or the number simply is not reachable from Puerto Rico. They need to have a non toll free number reachable from anywhere the product is sold.I have two ragdolls and therefore the Cat Genie is a little small for them, the hood which probably would have reduced the tracking a lot is useless because the cats would not fit.The beeping sounds are really annoying.Overall this is a great idea with a mediocre execution. It has come a long way from the days of Litter Free but it still has a long way to go. In any case even with all of its flaws its still a whole lot better than Litter Robot and Litter Maid. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with them. This is so far the only marginally usable convenient product for an automated litter box"

115286,0,"This is the best option available for stackable and airtight containers. Most containers available just aren't airtight.My first issue is the 40lb+ is ridiculous. I could barely fit 25lbs in before it started spilling out the front. You have to stand it on end if you want to fit the full amount in and of course it is no longer stackable at that point.The second issue is, when stacking, you cannot fill the top vault more than half way before the weight of it causes a slight bend in the bottom vault which makes the lid impossible to screw on.

I am not sure if that's safe for the dog, myself, or my furniture, as it's clear it's the flea repellent that smells so strong. 2) The reflector material comes off almost immediately. 3) The buckle that is supposed to hold it in place is cheap and I have to resize it around his neck often.That said, the price is great, since these things can be very expensive. I am not sure I will buy again, though, since I do not want to have to go through that three-week limbo of now know if the smell means something harmful."

133866,0,"I normally give fish oil capsules from Nature's Made, but after seeing this product with high number of reviews I wanted to try it. The bottle came by itself (as opposed to include with other products) and well packaged. My dogs seem to love this oil. However, I noticed that both dogs start having runny bowel movement after I fed them the oil in their food. I am stopped using this for a while and start using capsule fish oil again to see if this fish oil is the culprit. All I want is to give my dogs the best fish oil for their health, and most economical purchase. I usually buy the Nature's Made FO when they have specials ""buy one get one free"". I was worried that maybe the Nature's Made brand may not be pure FO and I don't want to poison my dogs."
211578,1,I bought this for my chihuahua and it has been perfect. The carpets on each step keep it from being slippery and the whole set up is extremely stable. I highly recommend it for anyone with a small dog.

He hates baths and is beginning to hate them more and more with me giving them to him daily. It's not the only treatment he's getting for the skin allergies, but I was hoping it would help more than it is."

199254,0,"OK I was disappointed to see that the FURminator is actually the top of a clipper blade mounted in a plastic handle. I could have probably made one out of my collection of clipper blades! Having said that, when used in short strokes, it does seem to remove the dog's undercoat. However, it is tedious and my dog is very bony (greyhound mix) so it isn't very useful on him. I tried it on my cat and it seemed I had to push hard to get it ""into"" her coat, and she objected to that. Maybe it is because she wasn't freshly bathed. So, if you have the time, energy, and patience to do this, I'm sure it works well. I think I will stick to the PetSmart Grooming $55 shave every couple of months instead."

150903,0,"I like the idea of these more than the end results. The fact the bowls slip out of the hangers is nice for refilling, cleaning etc. However, I did note that the entire unit has been knocked off the side of the crate more than once (I did not have the bowl knocked out of the hanger as another reviewer noted though). I also found, after buying four bowls, that some hang more evenly/horizontally than others and it is not consistent bowl to bowl. I do plan to try to bend them back to horizontal (they were made inconsistently - it is not shipping damage or anything) - I am just not sure I expected to have to do that. I don't think it is a crate difference since all four hang at different angles in the same spot.A side note of sorts - I have also noticed that the cat on the outside of the crate can easily reach in and grab things out of these since now the food is conveniently hung in a stationary position up against the bars. Just an FYI if you have animals both in and out of the crate and are trying to keep them from eating each others' food for whatever reason."
197835,0,"We purchased this toy on the recommendation of several acquaintances, one of whom claimed that their two labrador mixes loved this ball, and would spend hours just pushing it around by themselves, fascinated by the ""ball-within-a-ball"" concept. Since we have two dogs, one of whom is young, curious, and very playful, we were hoping, perhaps foolishly, that this would be a toy that would be able to keep him entertained, at least for a short while, whilst the human members of the household were attending to necessary chores, etc. We care about our dogs very much, but there are moments when we have to direct our attention towards other duties, which can be difficult with a very high energy dog.Since most dog toys are designed for the human and dog to play with together, and our doggy tears through bones in minutes and there are only so many treats one can give him in treat dispensing toys without overfeeding him, we were searching for a toy that would at least pique his curiosity long enough that it would be able to keep him occupied in those moments when we have to pay attention to something besides him. This was not that toy. For some reason, no matter how appealing we tried to make this toy, and no matter how much we ""oooh""ed and ""aaahh""ed over it to try to get the dogs interested, neither of our dogs (Labrador mix and Golden Retriever) wanted anything to do with this toy.Giving it three stars because the idea is a good one, and the construction is decent, the plastic it is made out of seems pretty sturdy and it would probably take a fair amount of chewing before a dog could completely destroy it. (The small ball inside is made of flimsier plastic, but it seems like it would be very difficult for a dog to get ahold of that to chew on.) It's a good concept for a dog toy, and it seems like other dogs like it from what we've heard, but be aware that your dog may simply not be interested, even if he or she is, like our dogs, very playful and happy to play with any other toy they are presented with.We were not able to ""test drive"" this toy in a pet store because none of our local pet stores carried the large size (10 inch) we needed since our dogs are large, but because our dogs typically will play with anything, we didn't really think it would be a problem. For reasons that are unclear, this is the only dog toy that our dogs have simply not wanted to play with."
153101,0,"This is a terrific product, and customer support is fantastic. It works as it claims it will.All those things said, I have to be honest and tell you one of my cats won't use it at all. He goes on the floor beside it.The other cat, small though she is, stand in it and urinates out the door or over the sides. I've even purchased the optional dome, and she still goes out the door.The walls are too short and the doorway is too ""widely open."" I purchased four more sets of walls and stacked them tightly and strapped them together. It raised the sides, but she's still going out the doorway. I'm going to order 1, maybe 2, more side sets and hope that takes care of the problem. She climbs onto the sides as she's getting into the box anyway, so I doubt the sides will be too high.Now if these design problems were fixed, it would be the best thing ever invented for a litter box! Catgenie just needs to work on the design, so it better suits all cats and not just the ""perfect ones"" who don't have opinions. I don't know about you, but I've had 5 cats (only two currently); and they've ALL had very strong opinions and no problem getting that opinion known."

One cat in particular was inside fighting with Amber and making its mess for several days while we were out of town.

Installation to replace the conventional kitty door was pretty easy, and Amber had no trouble wearing the magnet on her collar and learning to use her new door. Highly recommended!"

It is soft but doesn't have the sherpa texture.Also, the bed comes in a box (from Majestic) folded in half. It took a couple of days for it to lay properly. I agree that this bed is very light weight. I am using it for 2 dogs that are each under 20 lb. Therefore, it is sturdy enough for them. I would not recommend it for a 50 lb. dog."

And when it gets really worn it sticks out. But I just pulled the ends out when that happened.My dog absolutely loves this toy, it simply his favorite.Stocked up and bought 3 of these the other day :)"

61836,2,I tried it on the audio to see if it worked and it worked infrequently when my dog barked in the house. The barking in the house was very loud. This would have no effect out in the yard on neighbors dogs so I used it from a window. It had little effect on their need to bark but they found it annoying and would go to the far side of the pen. Bark free was not sensitive to barking and did not work unless I pressed the button on audio. It certainly was not cheap. Thank God these horrible neighbors who had dogs penned about 60feet from my window are no longer there. In this county there are no enforced ordinances.

We has an animal behaviorist come in and help us with various techniques to work on with our dog to lessen her fear and aggression. The behaviorist said that in her experience these collars are effective 50% of the time, which these reviews seem to reflect. I feel it's worth it to try it if you have an anxious dog before other, more extreme or expensive products (e.g., drugs). Whether it works or not is probably more due to your individual dog, rather than the product itself."

I purchased this for around $6.00 through Amazon (give or take a few pennies). For a toy this small, it is borderline expensive... Especially considering the fact that it IS made in China. The pig has a sound box inside it, which does deliver noise to entice a dog's curiosity. I don't think this will stand the test of time though, even if you're like me and you supervise all toy play time with your dog."

But with the gentle leader it was amazing and after 3 walks he no longer tries to take it off. He doesn't even lunge at other dogs!! I love it!! Its the best $13 I've ever spent!"

She likes this better than our movies but She only watches it sometimes. She's not quite as enthusiastic about it as the cats in the preview. So, I'd say if you know your cat watches TV and is fairly active, go for it. The loop feature is great! And if your cat is not that attentive, hey, at least it wasn't a very expensive cat purchase and it can't hurt. :)I really like the product."

The non-pinch top is good, easy to install unit, works. Height is perfect, width more than adequate, and it's just flexible enough to install in odd places. I recommend it. I doubt however it is something that could withstand more than a couple of years of being beaten by dogs and kids. Packaging was horrible, but item arrived in one piece with all its parts."

155533,0,"My girlfriend wanted to buy something to hide the litter box in so it wasnt in plain site. Its easy to put together but the one I received didnt align perfectly and had to file one of the sides for it to align. If it werent for that I ould be giving this 5 stars. But at this price you expect it to be perfect when putting it together. This would have frustrated a lot of buyers possibly to the point of returning it.Once we put this together we also found out that the typical literbox with the covers wont fit. You need to buy a smaller one without the cover for it to fit. That wasnt much of an issue since we could get one at walmart for 4 bucks.Another tip is to line the inside with the plastic see through sticky paper used for books (sorry, the word for it evades me right now) prior to assembling the whole thing so the wood doesnt absob any smells and its easier to just wipe and clean."

If color doesn't matter to you then you may be ok with this. It is definitely not a cream color ... try more like a pale pink. That must be why they are selling it cheaper than normal. I'm sure I will get used to it but it looks like a bad batch got out ... yikes!

53623,0,"I looked at many harnesses and knew I wanted a front-pull, martingale harness. When I was looking at the SENSE-ible, I didn't notice it wasn't a martingale. So, I was disappointed on that score when it arrived. But that's my mistake. It is well-made, and the profile is low--in other words, I can pet my dog without having to dodge a million bulky buckles. The colors are extremely limited in the small sizes.It didn't control pulling much better than back-pull harnesses.If you don't care about the martingale feature, then I can recommend this. However, I'd suggest that you reconsider. Without the martingale feature, the harness shifts around significantly. With a martingale, I can leave the harness loose, but the dog tugging snugs it up without pulling the harness around, which would, I fear, lead to chafing or discomfort."
17814,0,"This collar worked the first day as a charm.Then no more, the mechanics and spraying and all works fine, not problem, but I do can not figure out why the spray does not go on her nose anymore, I loosen it and tighten it and still no good.Also I think she got used to the smell. One time she was barking her heads off I ran in the yard and it was like I had 50 citronella candels lit at the same time, and she was still barking. Hey at least she won't have any bugs on her.I need to try again and study how to make it work again."

The feathers are attached to a string, which my cats immediately chewed through. I keep re-knotting it, they keep chewing through it. It would work so much better if it were fishing line or some kind of strong nylon. Also, the plastic handle which comes in two parts is difficult to put together, and while doing so it creates tons on teeny tiny splinters, which then get stuck in your hands. I had to cover those joints with packing tape. In all a great idea, done cheeply and poorly."

171894,0,"This makes the not so fun task of cleaning of the poop somewhat more pleasant. You don't have to bend over and pick up the mess any longer. The rake which is included is relatively effective even when working with grass. However, the tines on the rake could be a bit more substantial. They do tend to bend relatively easily. Once it has been used, I don't think that you really want to work on bending the tines back into place. If you're cleaning up a poop in a deeper wet snow the rake will be almost useless, as the tines just bend back. You can use the shovel portion once frozen and scoop under for those!Took away a star from the original after several months of use, the tines are bent differently. Sounds benign, but when one of those awkward ones grabs on the ground, and it flings poo at your dress pants, you're not going to be happy."

But since I don't have an infestation I assume it would have taken much longer for the fleas to make their way to the trap.

It indicates that you are supposed to spray the top of the poop, then there's a step where you must flip the poop over to spray the underside. Well, if I'm gonna flip the crap over, I may as well just pick the damn thing up. Pardon the pun, but this product is the biggest 'waste' of money ever."
90054,0,"This hat is really cute- it's basically everything its advertised to be, but my maltese hated it. It seems like the strap under the chin was going to choke him. The one picture I have of him wearing it, he looks miserable. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
17826,1,"This is a fabulous product! My mixed-breed rescue dog barked at every noise. With the Gentle Spray he learned to be quiet in 2 weeks. Now he only wears the collar for occasional reinforcement. I followed the product's directions, and now the words, ""Good quiet,"" are all he needs. He disliked the citronella, but it certainly did not hurt him."
179228,2,"Maybe at one time these were built properly, but we bought two recently that were pure crap. The yellow ""flowers"" don't quite fit in their holes, and pop out. The base has to be aligned PERFECTLY with the storage bottle in order for it to go together; trying to line these two pieces up frequently results in a lot of the feed splashing out. The two of these units we bought are sitting in a corner, wasted money. If you're interested in high-capacity feeders, look for the Best-1 72-oz. We got two of these at the same time we did these two Perky Pets, and love them. I STRONGLY suggest you do not waste your money on this poorly engineered, poorly constructed, and poorly thought out product."
207609,1,"May not be pretty as my 4 year old put it, but it looks like the picture and works as stated. I do have a very small turtle though I added weights to my dock and it will hold 1 lb 5 oz up out of the water before sinking under.Had the grainy sand stuff but rinsed it off before putting in the tank (who would not wash something new before exposing there animals to it any way?). No scrubbing as it is foam afterall. I like it, my kid's turtle likes it, and it is as advertised so thumbs up.I also think it is great ZooMed provides products I can afford that work. I also use their turtle filter."
94857,2,"We've had had alot of problems with our blue heeler barking uncontrollably whenever visitors stop at the house. We were hoping this would deter her barking by at least 50% to something tolerable. Boy, were we disappointed.At first, the spray startled her but did not stop her from barking. After getting used to the spray, it doesn't even surprize her anymore. It just makes the house smell like citronella as she barks away until the visitors are gone (and these are people that frequently visit).I purchased another three cans thinking it would just take a little longer but it looks like it will be a wasted effort. We opted to purchase the spray collar instead of the shock collar thinking it would be the more humane approach to breaking the annoying habit. When given a 50/50 chance.......well, that's why I don't go to the casino."
115437,1,"I purchased this a few weeks ago. I placed this container right where we are having issues with ants. I put some dog food in it. Not a lot just enough to test it. Absolutely no problems.I find the reviews for this item to be more about other complaints then just keeping bugs out.Why would anyone throw a full bag of expensive dog food in a container before testing it ? Why leave it out side ?If you need to leave out side one would think a person would know critters will eat through plastic to get the food. Some complaints are over stacking. Yes it says stackable, if its protecting the contents in side the container isn't that a major plus.Most reviews for this item are are not about how it protects the food inside but rather what it doesn't do out side the container.My only complaint is for something so simple and made of plastic. It sure is expensive, yet so is the dog food my dogs eat. They don't eat the cheap junk, a healthy dog eats good healthy dog food."
104076,1,This dog toy was delivered as advertised via ground shipping - I think it took about 5-6 days. It had a loop of string on the top that we cut off before giving to our dogs and they enjoy chasing it around and making it squeak.
28536,2,"I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum."
114278,1,"I bought this collar so that I could use the Tracker Flash Hunting Dog Collar Lights, red and green, when I walk my son's dog at night. It is a very strong collar and it works fine for that purpose. My son normally uses a collar that is some sort of fabric reinforced plastic that doesn't absorb odors on his dog. But that collar has the usual side release buckles on it and the Tracker Flash Hunting Dog Collar Lights will not fit on it."
67496,0,"My poor car--she loves this when it's up, but it keeps falling off. It also made marks on my wall. I may not have allowed it to sit long enough before my cat sat on it, so it may be my fault, but it's still pretty frustrating. Warning: follow instructions EXACTLY."
186767,0,"My puppy chewed through the red plastic handle and after that started on the ""rope"", which is many thin threads braided together. She was able to break the threads with no problem. If your dog likes to tug and doesn't chew, it should be fine, but for aggressive chewers -- it isn't indestructible."
192561,2,"I bought an everlasting treat ball because everyone told me how wonderful they are, and I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is fairly calm for the breed, but does tend to have a bit of a seperation anxiety problem as soon as I leave. I got it yesterday, popped the caps on either end of the ball, and gave it to him on the five mile ride back to my apartment. By the time I had gotten home, he had already popped one of the caps off and chewed it up, so I took that one away and popped the third cap on, and gave it back to him, and both caps were off and eaten within probably fifteen minutes of being at home. I am completely unimpressed, I spent over $16 on these treats and the ball, and the Everlasting Treat ball was useless in a matter of minutes. I still really like the idea of this product, but the ball itself needs to be manufactured in a way that would really grip the treats a lot better."
29552,0,"I bought this toy locally expecting it to last and last.....well 20 minutes later my 8 month old pup weighing in at 40 lbs. had it torn open and eating stuffing.Exposed seems, weak tennis ball, tight corners are all negatives in a toy meant to be super tough.The reason I gave it three stars is that he company sent me 2 replacements as compensation.BTW, he has already torn them open too."
199323,1,We have a very furry Chow mix dog and this works great on her. She doesn't seem to mind it and it pulls up a lot of hair. I would definitely recommend this product. The larger would one probably be best for big dogs.
170887,2,"My cat is smart, she walked around the mat in order to avoid it. Won't buy this again."
118558,2,"This is a good idea for a product, but the design is poor.After I had ordered the 2-pack for around $7 with shipping, I found a 4-pack at the 99 store, so I felt that I paid too much.The design makes it difficult to put the two halves back together once you have loaded the food or treats.I would recommend cutting a small hole in a tennis ball. That is what I have done and my cat seems to like it better.If you still want this product, let me know, I'd be happy to send it to you for the price of the shipping."

37393,0,I was a little disapponted with this item .It doesn't stay warm but 10 min at most.But it will stay warm long enough for the puppy to lay on top of it and get to sleep if they have had a active day and are very tired.I like the snuggle safe it larger and stays warm for 10 hours.I have three of those.One I have used for three years
196454,1,This filter seems to work quite well and is very easy to change. I only have to put in a new one about once every 30 days. Doing that along with regular cleanings and water changes seem to keep the aquarium in balance and the fish healthy.
12881,0,"The actual cage once put together is awesome, however assembly was difficult. It took me (and then my husband) about 40 minutes to put this thing together. The plastic snap together pieces are very awkward and are tough to snap together. They don't like to stay together, and then putting the ramps and platforms in is quite gymnastic in nature, lol. But it is together, and it is solid. It is a lot bigger than we thought it would be and our 2 year old male ferret loves it! We had to take the slide part out and add a ramp from his old cage because he was just too big to fit up the spiral, but it is all good with modification. He is sleeping happily in his hammock now, enjoying his new home. The rollers on the bottom are a nice touch as well."
42305,0,"Unfortunately, my little dog is between 6 and 7 lbs. so based on reviews of the small Snoozer Console Car Seat, I chose to try the large seat. I have a RAV4 SUV and this size is way too big. I'm going to return it and order the small and cross my fingers she fits comfortable in it. I think it is well made and very comfortable for the dog. Based on the stated dimensions, the small should just barely fit. Will update if it works!"
160496,0,"I bought two of these, one for each floor in my house, as an additional scratch post with the bonus of a game to play. They seem sturdy and well-made. However, in regards to their intended use... Well, let's just say it wasn't as successful as I was hoping, but at least they're washable.The scratcher in the middle actually rarely gets used. My cats usually love these type of cardboard scratchers and will use the plain ones I have enthusiastically, but this one doesn't seem to be attractive for that purpose. I'm not sure what it is, maybe the surrounding ball channel, that keeps the cats off of it. I placed the one in the basement near one of their favorite scratch spots down there but they keep ignoring it in favor of the sofa. Sprinkling cat nip on it gets them interested temporarily, but that doesn't last long. Curiously enough, I've kept some of the old cardboard inserts in the garage and my cats have discovered those and will use them as scratch pads now, but never used them while they were inside the toy.The ball running in the track is a neat idea and at least two of my four cats actually get the idea and will play with it when I'm running the ball around. One will occasionally play with it on his own, another will put his little toy mice or fur balls into the channel and bat those around in it. It does not seem to be much of a ""play by yourself"" toy though. They are more likely to interact with it if you show them how to use it and play with them.The main issue I'm having with this toy is that it seems to be more attractive as a place to pee on than play with or scratch on. It may be the type of plastic used or the shiny surface, but something about it says ""pee on me"" to older cats. Usually, my oldest will pee into the ball channel, but sometimes he'll miss. Pretty much the only times I've had to replace the cardboard inserts were not because they got worn out from scratching, but because they got soaked in cat pee. I had to place a puppy pee pad underneath the toy to prevent the surrounding floor from getting wet. I'm not the only one with this problem either. A friend of mine has one in her house and stopped replacing the cardboard inserts altogether because her oldest cat pees in it as well. Luckily it's easy to take out the insert and ball, wash everything, and put a new insert in, but it's certainly not the intended use."

182847,0,"This is a great way to keep your litter box clean without daily maintenance. Just check it every other day or so to empty the waste receptacle and clean the rake.Only problem is, it worked great for about a year (the length of the manufacturer's warranty) and then broke down on me & my felines! The rake would get so far and when it got to the point where it had to lift the waste it would get stuck and make this loud clicking noise until you pushed the rake the rest of the way. There is no replacement part or service available; only buy a new one! I'm buying a PetMate now; we'll see how long that one lasts!"

I will need to further investigate if there is another shampoo to help relieve the itch."

I never had any problems, but if you have dumbo rats or baby rats, it might be an issue. My girls loved the extra space and I also noticed they slimmed down a bit from running around so much! Some of the slides and slopes were hard to clip into the levels but we have not had any problems with quality or parts breaking."

One of them, a Pit Bull, has taken it into her head that I must be destroyed every time I make an appearance in my back yard. She can see me and attacks the fence, barking incessantly. I bought the Lentek Bark Free in an attempt to quell the noise, but the device only seemed to make the barking more furious. The problem lies more with the dog than with the device, so I am giving it 3 stars. A new fence is in order instead."
28453,0,"The pup liked this toy very much, but I do not recommend if you have any type of carpet in your house. We don't even have carpet - just a few wool rugs, but the toy was soon the most disgusting thing in our house. All the rug fibers and dirt and slobber matted around the nubs on this toy, making it very unpleasant to touch. We tossed it outdoors, and it wasn't much better. Those nubs grab everything gross and use slobber as glue to make sure that it stays that way."

5345,2,"This incident report is about the Angel's Eyes powder used on a sixteen (160 Pound poodle, 7 Years old. The product was purchased based on advertising and received promptly.When used the first day we noticed our dog could not keep his eyes open because of apparent light sensitivity. This continued until day two or for approximately 30 hours and gradually subsided.When the manufacture was called it was blamed on Liver allergy, which had never surfaced before. It was suggested we take the dog to a vet and he/she determined product sensitivity we could return the product for ""up to 50% refund. If you are a perspective buyer I am sure you can do the math and understand why we did not follow through. (After the cost of bringing the dog to the vet and then shipping it would have cost me more)The bad side - we spent about $80.00 on a product that did not work for us . The good side - our dog was/is just fine once the side effect, adverse reaction wore off.Buyers be careful of this productRobert Bulmer/ Naples, Florida"

62066,2,i have used this product before and has worked great. however this batch isn't quite up to par. it repels fleas(but not much problem with them in winter anyway) but has not been effective against ticks. hopefully second dose will work better.
194816,2,"I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.Note that the ""Zuke's Jerky Naturals"" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog."

150791,0,"About a year ago, my dog and I discovered this adorable, softly 'voiced' toy. Since then, my two year old beagle has had an obsession with these overstuffed, fluffy creatures. Unfortunately, the toy - while cute and soft - doesn't hold up well under my animal's hunter instincts. While a few of her 'herd' have lasted a week or more, she's been able to take one of these apart in as little as 15 minutes. That said, she has as much fun with the 'sheepskin' as she has with the toy in tact, so we keep buying. If you have a pet that doesn't destroy stuffed toys, this is a great option. Its sound is a muffled 'baaah' that is nowhere near as annoying as the typical squeaky toy."

162200,0,"My 30lb aussie mix ate the rings off in less than 5 minutes, but he enjoyed just chewing on the plastic bone ends by themselves. The toy lasted longer than most do for him, but his mouth is slightly too small for the ball, which is all that is left of it. This is a very heavy toy, not good for fetching."
103506,1,"I purchased this substrate from Amazon because I had heard good reviews about it from the YouTube fish tank community. I set it up in my 55 gallon aquarium with a DIY black background, and boy do the plants look stunning! The black really brings out the color in my fish and the green/red in my plants. It has a large amount of nutrients in it, and I suppose you could use the substrate alone without fertilizers or CO2. I just use a $9.00 250m bottle of Flourish, an aquatic plant fertilizer that I bought at Petsmart. It lasts for 2 years for the size of my aquarium, so it's a worthy investment.My only complaint about this product is that it is kind of misleading when it says that it has beneficial bacteria in it to cycle your tank. Please don't take it like it will instantly cycle your tank. It comes packed in water which is cycled, and smells very foul when you cut open the bag. ALSO, make sure that when you open the bag that you open it up over your aquarium or over a tub/outside, as it is almost like vacuumed sealed and it will splash. I made that mistake and it spilled all over my floor. No big deal, though. Anyway, you need to let your aquarium cycle completely just like you would with any other aquarium.The substrate itself consists of very small sand particles and small sized granules. The package says that the small particles sift down to the bottom of the tank naturally to allow for optimum root growth and CO2/Nutrient supply, which is mostly true. Some of the particles still are on the top layer of the substrate, but overall the statement is true.The bag also says that you do not need to wash this substrate before filling your aquarium up. I have found this to be completely true. Because it comes packed in water, there is really no residual dust on the granules. You may have a little cloudiness for 2 hours to a day depending on the amount of filtration/size of the tank, but it's again no big deal. Only 3 days after setting up my tank the water was crystal clear.Overall I would give this substrate a 4/5. Would buy again, but not at the normal price it is listed for (30 bucks). I'd buy it from my LFS which sells it for 17 per 20 lbs."
89479,0,"I used to buy this brand all the time for my previous cats that passed away about 4 years ago. We did not have anymore cats, but we just go a new kitten in November. I bought other brands, but I remembered that I used to use Van Ness which you can't find at Pet supply stores anymore. These bags are not the same. The cat scratches through the bags and ripes wholes. I switched to the Jumbo johnny cat bags which are pricey but much stronger."
146462,1,"I can't believe there are not a ton of rave reviews for this product, I KNOW it's what saved my 3 month old rescue puppy from dying when he had distemper. The vet and I had tried everything. I also did what Dr Pitcairn recommended in his book on natural dog and cat care. Although some days were better than others, my baby slowly became a motionless limp rag within a couple weeks or so of fighting this horrendous disease. He seemed to have coughed the life out of himself. It appeared totally hopeless. Heartbroken, I made burial arrangements and called my vet to discuss euthanasia (which she was ready to do). Then I called a close friend for moral support and she was adamant that I try Pet Nutri-drops. I got the product, didn't like one of the ingredients, but thought - what have we got to lose? With each dose I saw improvement...within a few minutes!! It was amazing!!! By the time another dose was due, his symptoms had regressed but weren't quite as bad as they were before the last dose. The reason it works so fast, according to the company, is because it bypasses the digestive track by ""shunting"" through the stomach wall directly into the bloodstream, where it delivers large doses of Vitamin A, D and E plus some B and trace minerals. I gave the product to my baby for a month though he was doing great after a couple weeks. Now he's 12 years old and in excellent condition. As I recall, this product is specific for bringing sick animals back to health, but not as a regular supplement. I'm sure you could talk to the company if you want to know about that. BTW, my vet said that a dog has about 0.05% chance of surviving distemper. I sure hope veterinarians read this; they could save more dogs from needless death. What else could have saved my dog's life? The battle was lost. The only thing that turned things around (and it was obvious within minutes of each dose) was this product."

They are slowly making their way through this one, though to be fair it is taking them much much longer than any other hammock I have purchased for them. It helps that it is shaped triangularly and the clips are in one place and its difficult for them to climb up to where the hammock hangs. It is very soft inside, comfortable (or so I presume) and can be machine washed. The biggest problem I have with are the zippers, the hammock would be much more durable and useful if it was one solid piece. instead of having zippers up the sides."

She spends about forty minutes pushing it around the house. Since this ball is made of rubber, it's a lot quieter than a lot of similar products. All that being said, my other dog, bless her heart (she's very loving and cute), couldn't figure out the ball. She just sits and stares at it, or maybe sniffs it. For the life of me, I can't get her to push it around. However, that's not incredibly surprising. She's always been a bit on the umm... not so bright side."

154950,0,"I had used the littermaid mega box for more than 5 years before switching to this ScoopFree box. The main reason is that it is hard to find the right clumping litter for the old littermaid box. Not to mention the difficulty in cleaning the old littermaid box because of all the nudges and indentations in the box molding.I have used this ScoopFree box for a month.This newer ScoopFree box is way better in terms of ease of cleaning. If you think you do not need to clean because you are using an automatic litter box, you are wrong. Occasionaly you still need to clean the inside of the box if you see dried pee. Make sure you also buy the hoop.Now the main problem with this product. The disposable cartriage has a very poor design. The idea is a big step forward but the design is poor. It is just made from paper. The bottom of the cartriage has a plastic like sheet to prevent pee to leak through. Now that is good except that sheet only covers up to the four edges! Pee is like water, it just leak through whereever there is a gap. There are four uncovered edges at the bottom and it is very likely that your cat(s) pee on an area where there is no crystal or if the crystal there already has saturated. I have to put a very big plastic storage lid under the entire litter box to catch leaked pee. It is not uncommon to see a pool of pee on the lid after a week of use.A better design for the cartriage is to have the plastic protective sheet shaped like a bowl. I think for the price of those cartriages, it is something the manufacturer can do."

The only real problem for the cats comes from the flimsy construction. It's not like the cat would actually fall through it, but the cats seem to think they will. A more firm plastic would have been appreciated.We believe the problem in usage lies in our cats and ourselves, not the product. More written assistance with problems getting the cat to use the product would be appreciated because included directions and troubleshooting help are very sparse! Their website is easy to navigate, but it just doesn't provide the help needed in certain areas.The product comes with catnip, but why? Are they expecting you to use as part of the training or is it just a nice treat for the cats? They never do say.At this point, we're hoping our cats will become acclimated to the CitiKitty being on the toilet soon so we can finally take away the litter box next to the toilet.

151127,2,"Every tutorial for this collar (and all collars) specifically states that they need to stay under the chin of the dog in order to work. This collar does not have a closure hook or clasp so it must be put on over the dog's head. Well, in order to get it over the dog's head, it has to be much larger than the neck. The collar slips down and does not stay in place and therefore cannot work properly. It should be made with some sort of a hook closure to put it on and off without going over the head...

I was very dissapointed to learn that the additional collars did not come with the protective training caps to put on the extra collars to start training the dogs (the training caps allow you to put the collar on your dog but it protects them from getting shocked so you can first train them to learn where the boundry is and only hear the tones) so, I called innotek to find out how I am supposed to train my other two dogs. They told me I could buy a kit that has the extra plastic caps for $10 per kit! and the kit includes the removal tool and extra prong extenders that already came with the collars in the first place. They then suggested that I dissasemble the collar between training each dog and install the caps on the next dogs collar. Sounds easy, but when you are trying to train 3 dogs each day on this month long training program, the last thing you want to be doing is disassembling a collar three times to accomodate the different dogs (my dogs range from a lab to a chuahua). Long story short, it probably would cost Innotek about $.01 to add the little plastic caps to each collar sold, but they wern't smart enough to think of that to keep customers happy and rather than pay and extra $20 to buy parts I don't need, I will probably go to Lowes and try to find something to act as a protective caps. I'm just ticked that I can't start the dog training yet. thanks innotek!"
154726,1,Never had an automatic litter box before. i did a lot of reserch on them before choosing this one and have not regretted buying this one. It works great. I get close to 21 days between changes. and there is no odor. The first time i had to add some regular litter to help train my cat to use it but she took to it great after that.
191665,1,"In our home, Maxx gets excited when asked if he wants a 'chicken cookie'. He'll do anything for one of these dehydrated discs of chicken. Between the size of a quarter and a half-dollar, these 'cookies' are easily snapped into smaller serving sizes (very useful for training treats). They come in a see-through plastic container with a screw-top lid. Besides the size and convenience being a plus, so too, is its ingredient: 100% pure chicken. There are no additives, no fillers. Another plus is that, this product doesn't have an offensive dog food smell. I feel that I'm giving my dog a healthy treat when he's rewarded with Chicken Nibbles.Whenever friends visit with their dogs I give them Chicken Nibbles, too. They love them so much that, their owners inevitably ask where to buy them. They used to be found at a big box pet store but, no longer carry them. I'm delighted to have found them at Amazon.com. Now we can all buy them right here.About Cost:A container usually lasts a few months so, the price is not unreasonable. When you consider that, you probably buy a variety of treats in smaller quantities (more frequently), there is not much difference in cost. When you don't have to make a trip to the pet store, there is savings, too, in having it delivered to your home. There are further savings when you buy through Amazon Prime; there is only an annual fee and not one for each time that you make an Amazon purchase."
7825,0,This spray covered the smell the first few times but my cat kept going back to the same place to pee even after I cleaned the carpet and after a few times it was not working as well. I wish it stopped the smell enough so that my cat couldnt smell it
26347,0,"I have had several Lupine collars and the product is absolutely the best there is. These can't be destroyed!! The colors stay sharp and it doesn't fray no matter what you do to it (and we're pretty harsh on our dog stuff around here).My ONLY complaint is that this collar doesn't have a 'click' buckle to open and close the collar, it has to be slipped over the dog's head. Kennels do not accept these types of collars and they're not ideal for dogs with great big heads (like mine). I assumed all Lupines had buckles on them and didn't even think to look more closely!!"

11174,2,"I purchased this as a back-up spare after my original all-tape Flexi Classic got caught in a crack & the tape was damaged. I did not realize that this leash includes a section next to the collar attachment that does not retract.The first time I used it it somehow snapped back while I was fastening it on my dog's collar. It took a chunk out of my finger that bled for almost an hour; it was painful for several days after and still isn't fully healed. I haven't used it since, and have ordered an all-tape leash which I hope will be the same model as my old one. I have used tape Flexi's for over 2 years with no problem, and this is a poor substitute. The design is awkward, and since the non-retracting section hangs loose it is inconvenient to carry or store. I rate my tape Flexi's ( I have 3 in all, two of them 25' Classics) 5 stars; I would not recommend this model at all.Flexi now makes so many different models that it is quite confusing, so be certain that the one you order is the one you really want."
170670,1,"I bought this jacket to use on my then 90lb Boerboel (South African Mastiff) puppy and there is room to grow. She had never swam before and the jacket gave her the confidence to follow the other dog out into the lake. The jacket does a good job supporting her weight. It was a little big on my 80lb lab mix, but gave me the peace of mind that he wouldn't drown if he tired. Kyjen has a good reputation and I would recommend this life jacket to other x-large breed owners. This product was filled and shipped by Amazon and received just a few days after placing the order."

56709,0,"The opening is too small - the cover is attached nearly 3/4 the way around, which only leaves a small entry. Thought my Shih Tzu would like, but she never slept in it. She only got treats and toys I hid in it. My mistake - she's a nester, not a burrower (never burrows under covers). She sleeps in a nesting bed, similar to this one,Slumber Pet Dimple Plush Nesting Bed 18 In Pink, where she curls up next to the sides.Update - gave bed to the neighbor's puppy dachshund. He LOVES it! He doesn't have to sleep in his crate anymore! Yay!"
110488,0,When the crate arrived it required minor assembly. I have a 13 week old Pomeranian and I almost feel guilty leaving her in there for more than 5 minutes because the space was a little smaller than anticipated. I would definately reccommend a size up depending on the size of your animal. Price wasn't bad considering the satisfaction of the product. Will post pictures shortly.

131629,2,"This thing is a blast and my German Shepherd really loves how it flies. It almost hovers sometimes... she could catch it 9/10 throws. Lots of fun.But... it falls apart. I didn't ever let Juno chew this thing, it was a fetch-only toy. She is an aggressive frisbee catcher, I guess, often snapping them out of the air or pouncing on it as it tumbles through its landing. Anyhow, it's weak around the 'feet' and that is where the first tear happened. From there, a similar tear afflicted the other 3 feet and eventually the feet were nearly coming off, exposing the tubes inside. Eventually one section of tube worked itself out of the fabric. It still flies as of today, but it's about 8 or 9 days old. Not exactly an economical choice. I'd recommend this if your dog doesn't actually catch the frisbee... or is extremely gentle with it when it does. Great idea, just not durable enough."

2724,0,"This retractable leash incorporates a bag system to make it one of the most convenient methods to walk your dog.The leash system is easy to use. Pushing the release button allows you to control the distance that your dog can walk ahead of you. The handle has a rubber grip which is comfortable.A small port that holds the bags for picking up your dog's messes, is convenient. However the 'holding hook' doesn't hold the 'filled bag' very well and frequently, after completing a walk, I have found the bag missing.The durability leaves much to be desired. The spring loaded mechanism lasted only 10 months for me. Given the price, that is not acceptable.I have switched to a conventional leash since this unit broke.Conclusion:The concept is great and the system is convenient. However, the durability makes this a less an average value. I don't recommend this item."
71995,2,"It's NOT working!The cats walk in front of it very casually. I can't believe that ""CATSTOP"" didn't work. Yes, I've tried to put it under roof, on the wall, on the fence, in front of door..... Nothing worked!"

I had this in the second stage, right after a couple of sponges. The purigen was unusable after about 2 weeks. I read that you could clean it by soaking it in a bleach/water mixture for 24 hours, but its a pain to keep opening and closing my filter. when i open my filter, i want to be able to clean or replace media, and then close it again for a couple of weeks. This product is too expensive to be used as disposable media. im sure this product is fine for many applications, but it just doesnt really work for me."

The outer cover easily comes off for washing, however the inner mesh (that holds the stuffing) does not come off nor is it water proof/resistant. The inner mesh is also very flimsy and you will tear it taking the cover off and on. All in all the bed is good but has a lot of room for improvement before its worth the price."

I liked the idea of a flea trap, but I have to say that it has been a big failure. It was easy to set up. I located it just next to my dog's favorite sleeping spot. I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and maybe there are 3-4 fleas on the sticky pad! I'm still using it, hoping for the best, but I've moved onto other possibilities... I am updating my review of this product. Although the trap doesn't work well for me where I originally located it (near the dog's favorite bed), the trap does work in my basement which has tons of fleas! The fleas seem to be attracted to the light and then they get stuck. So, it does work in specific situations."

26047,0,I am using this product for a Hedgehog. It works really well for at night to help keep the cage warmer. He doesn't actually sleep on it but not having to worry about him going into hibernation is nice. I would recommend this product for small animals. It is a little bulky so make sure you have a larger cage.
80973,0,I don't usually write reviews but thought that this one needed one. We bought the hedgehog Egg Baby and thought that it worked out great. Our dog (about 50lbs) really seemed to enjoy it until he thought that the head was a ball too and liked it too much. He tore open the head (from the inside where they pull the balls from) and pulled all the stuffing out. We still use it and just stuff an extra ball in there and now he can't really destroy anything but the balls. I was also excited when I received it to see that the toy came with two free replacement balls which is always a plus for a dog owner whose dog destroys any squeaky in sight.
49391,0,"Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but ""small"", which were not that small. I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient."

111437,1,"I have 2 Maincoons - When they were young I gave them Iams thinking it was good food for them. Later after extensive research I switched very slowly to Felidae regular with good results (coat, energy, lack of urinary problems for one cat who tends to get them).In their 10th years I switched to Felidae platinum but I did it again very slowly - probably over a period of 3 to 4 months. First mixing a quarter platinum with 3/4 regular, then 1/2, etc.I am very pleased with the Platinum version: the food bowl is always available but the cat that was too plump lost weight and the cat that was too skinny gained some. One day I ran out and gave them some regular Felidae from a sample but that lead to quite a messy litter box (too much fat for older cats).I highly recommend this brand - a slow transition is key though."

Well...she didn't DESTROY the toy but she did chew the foot to the point of getting to the stuffing! So it may last longer than a traditional stuffed doggie toy....but it definitely can be destroyed! She also has some difficulty with it because of it's size. Probably better for a little larger dog."
185267,0,"About six weeks ago, our two small dogs were suddenly swarming with fleas. We tried two different flea shampoos, including Ovitrol. There was some minor relief, but the fleas were back in force within two days. However, this may be due more to the nature of the infestation rather than the shampoos. We got limited relief from Cedarcide and even Advantix II took five applications before we saw significant improvement."

I loved that thing due to my travel schedule, convenience etc. If they only made it quieter!At first I loved the new version. It is bigger, there is a sleep timer for no cleaning at night and the rake is removable. It worked ok for a few weeks and then found daily I was having to remove waste. I used to use Pet Gold litter and played around will the fill level. I was about to return it when I started reading reviews of all Littermaids. So I sprayed the bottom of the pan with cooking spray and changed to Worlds Best litter with an accurate fill level. No problems since. I even line the litter recepticle with a plastic grocery bag and it does the trick! The litter is more expensive and it smells like corn. Cats played around in it a bit at first although I find them sneezing less due to less dust from the old litter. Oh, and there is also an air cleaner on the unit.So, working through the kinks has helped and I like it again.."

Ever since though, he has figured out how to get the treats out of the ball quickly, then chews them up like biscuits.Thought the interlocking screw-on idea might keep the treats in the ball longer, but I think my dog just chewed off the end of the central threaded stick and then easily removed the treats as usual.Enjoyable but expensive for the short amount of time they last. Also, not sure of the calorie count? My dog is an 85lb young male german shepherd."
5448,0,"I can't say much about whether this product would eliminate stains around my dog's eyes, because I can hardly get her to eat at all if I'm putting this on her food. Or she doesn't drink her water until the ""soot"" of this powder settles to the bottom if I put it in her water.I think the issue may be that she sniffs her food before eating it, and the powder then goes up her nose. She hates that, so then doesn't want to eat the food. I get her to eat some by mixing it in with her treat of cooked chicken livers, but that isn't every day and I can't mix in nearly the amount recommended if I want her to eat even that. Too bad. All I can do is keep wiping her face every day with the cleaner pads, no matter that she hates it. She hates the powder in her food more."

171625,0,"The main cover itself has worked well for 4 months. Our 75-pound dog -- with long toenails -- can get in and out without moving it or damaging it. Our 1997 Toyota Corolla does not have very well-defined headrests in the back, but it was good enough.However, both of the straps that hold the cover onto the headrests disintegrated in just 2 or 3 months. Literally became brittle and snapped. This may be because we live in sunny California, keep the cover installed 24/7, and store the car outside. But I expected better durability.The good news is that we could easily thread a thin rope through all the metal grommets, then behind the two headrests in one big ""loop"", and tie it off. The cover sags a little but with our car and dog, still works sufficiently well that we are happy using it.P.S. We use this along with a seatbelt harness (Solvit 62296 Pet Vehicle Safety Harness, Large), which everyone should consider. If there is an accident your dog might have a better chance to survive."

However, I have had this for approximately 9 months, and after about 6, one of my smart kitties figured out how to get her claws inside of the feeder, and get it to move, so she started sneaking extra meals. Upon trying to keep her from doing this (by putting gorilla tape over the edge so that she couldn't sneak her nails in between the tray and the lid), the tray occasionally became stuck and the motor died. This only happened on one of the trays (I have 2). So, if you have a smart cat, I wouldn't recommend this item."

I thought this time I'd try this brand since it was so much cheaper and it said it was 100% Norwegian, which I've heard is the best. The pure Cod Liver Oil I had been getting smelled fishy (was unflavored Nordic Naturals ""Pet Cod Liver Oil"") which I would assume is how all REAL cod liver oil smells, but this stuff smells like castor oil, and when you refrigerate it, it becomes a semi solid which you have to wiggle out with a butter knife. The kind we are used to, the Nordic Naturals, needs to be refrigerated too, and unlike this product, it pours out smoothly and retains its consistency...and it smells good and fishy like my precious angels like it!"
63615,2,"This is a great idea for a collar. I loved it when I first received it. The next day I noticed the collar was starting to fray quite a bit, which continued to get worse.

36897,2,"This isn't a good toy for chewers, the plastic is too soft.Unfortunately, my dog likes food puzzle toys. She is already a masterKONGsolver, and recently got a ""Premier Twist 'N Treat"". Both involve chewing the toy. We have been trying to train our dog to roll the Tricky Treat ball. We have NOT left her alone with it so it is still in one piece. Unfortunately, because all her existing food puzzles involve chewing the treats out of the toy, she is having trouble figuring this one out. She keeps trying to chew it, and won't try to roll it. The main design flaw in my opinion is that it is made out of very soft plastic, and even light chewing will very quickly destroy it. Something like a ""Buster Food Cube"", which I believe is made out of more durable plastic, is probably a way better version of this style of toy. However, the Buster Cube is hard to find in stores.Bottom line: if this is your dog's first food puzzle, and your dog isn't a big chewer, then this MIGHT be a good toy. However, if your dog already knows how to solve things like Kongs, and/or is a chewer, then I would not reccomend this for your dog."

I had to remove the lower ""sling seat"" because it was in the way for climbing up the middle of the bungalow. Overall, it's OK and was worth the money."

612,2,I filled the water to the fill line and it leaks. BTW the seal was fine. When I put it down and the water went into the bowl it did come out. When I picked it up to move it to the back of the car the water didn't go back into the bottle but spilled out of the bowl. I tried filling it below the water line and the same thing happened. What a waste of money.

108614,0,"The SCAT MAT works as advertised and is well manufactured. However, the real world-presents challenges which drastically hinder the usefulness of the SCAT MAT.1. Floor-placement in a doorway: I have 3 cats--all of various temperaments and sizes, and all of them quickly figured out the MAT was causing the shock, so they jump over it with ease. Another fatal flaw is that YOU have to step over it all the time, which becomes more challenging at night-and when you forget it's there-which you WILL at some point, so you too will get ZAPPED!2. Counter-top placement: This is a challenge--if you USE your counter-top, then putting the MAT over top of items on the counter is a non-starter for several reasons. If the items are metal, it will cause the mat to continually ZAP and discharge the battery-not to mention it could become a fire hazard. Even if your counter-top is bare, the cat will likely slide on the mat as it rushes to get off of it--and if you have items around it-they will likely get knocked off the counter.3. Moving the mat from place to place: Now that my cats KNOW the MAT is the hazard, they avoid it--wherever it is placed, but resume jumping onto furniture, counter-tops, or other places I was trying to keep them OUT of, since they know the mat isn't there.The MAT does work as advertised, but if you have a smart cat, they will steer clear of the mat or mats you have strategically placed, and continue to thumb their noses at authority and go wherever they want to--since you cannot cover all territory with a mat or several mats, especially at these prices. Anytime you place it in your way (like on a chair, in a doorway, or on the counter--you have to remember not to touch it yourself and carefully turn it off and move it when you want it out of your way...which is less than convenient."

There were several instances where the collar shocked the dog repeatedly in the ""safe"" zone until we took the collar off of him. These instances were few and far between, but I still would not recommend having the dog on the collar unsupervised though.The reason for my bad review is not the product, but the company itself. After getting the use I needed from the product I listed it for sale on eBay. PetSafe's legal team waited until shortly before my Auction ended and flagged me for using their company product name in the listing of their product. With their competitive nature the company would not allow me to sell their own products! I was a loyal customer of theirs, but now I am not. This caused me a huge inconvenience in selling the product. This kind of act from large companies against individuals is not acceptable.Do not support a company that does this to their own customers. I would recommend finding a solution from a different provider for your pets needs."

147479,0,"Ceilie is our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix who is feeling her years! We started giving her these tablets once a day and she seemed to love them for the first week. After that, she really didn't want to take them any more and seemed very reluctant to put them in her mouth. Indeed, we'd noticed that she'd been a bit gassier but the last time we finally encouraged her to eat one she brought it back up within minutes. Maybe it was just too much for her delicate tummy. Really, I think they gave her heartburn!Every once in a while we give her one as a sort of ""booster"". She doesn't seem to have a negative reaction to the occasional supplementary use. For daily therapy, we give her the Happy Hips duck or chicken jerky treats sold by Dogswell. Amazon carries these treats and offer great prices for them. She has responded extremely well to the Happy Hips products, loves them, and they don't upset her tummy!"
75165,0,"My cats went bonkers over the Panic Mouse when I first turned it on, but they quickly developed a tolerance to it. One cat now lies on the floor in front of it and passively whaps it when the mouse wand moves past him. Another cat sits still and allows the wand to ""pet"" him. A couple other cats quiver in the background and watch the wand spin around with eyes like pinwheels, but they do not interact with it, no matter how fast or slow I set the toy. Perhaps it is the loud whirring noise that puts them off.The Panic Mouse seems sturdy and relatively well made, so I don't plan to write it off just yet. I think younger or more active cats would enjoy this cat toy more than older, lazy cats who just want to be adored.

In any case......we applied it to our 4 maltese yesterday afternoon and by last night TWO of them were having a bad reaction (bright red skin, scratching and just freaking out) and the other two were scratching the spot! We called the 24 hour emergency hospital and they said to bathe them and to give them Benadryl. If they don't improve today we have to give them antibiotics. My smallest is suffering the most right now, scratching the spot and crying. I just gave him another 1/2 of the Benadryl and hopefully it will help. Going to send Advantix the bill for any vet costs.

29052,1,"I've been an aquarium enthusiast for about 40 years now. Like many of you, I have used (or have tried to use) an air pump to help provide some extra action in the tank. The last brand to make a supposedly ""quiet"" and premium air pump now makes them so loud that it's impossible to have it in your room. I abandoned the use of them completely. I became curious about the power heads for aquariums. It totally transforms the tank into a much more fun environment for the fish (currents) and adds a huge amount of extra air into the water. You can adjust the air flow all the way down to zero, if you want, which makes it silent (I like quiet tanks). But I keep mine at full bore, with the air running, because it isn't really that loud. You will crack up when you see your previously passive fish become active and begin ""body surfing"" the currents in your aquarium. Remember the larger tanks at the City aquariums, with all the brisk movement in the tanks? It's like that. It does not overwhelm the fish and they love it. Air and water flow intensity are both adjustable. Totally transforms the tank into something fun for the fish and fascinating for the viewer. Highly recommended. Oh, after I saw how nice it was in my 37 gal., I bought another one for my 29 gal. It's a whole new experience now."
117622,2,"The product was very promptly delivered. The problem was that it needed to be shipped back almost as quickly. The product broke after two days of use. The handle piece and spring device broke off. The plastic parts on the side are not glued in and although the circular pieces have what looks like screws, they are merely slid into the holes. While this makes putting it together easy, it means the rods are loose and wobble (which could cause more wear and tear down the road).The biggest problem with this product is the fact that the metal in the side bar where you open and close the gate bends so when you try to tighten the top, the gate can't close (because the plastic piece fits like a lego without fastening). So to be able to open and close the gate without adjusting the tightness on the top, you have to leave it loose. That kind of defeats the purpose of having a sturdy gate.The only solution is to only use the gate one way and put the gate BEHIND the door jam. Then hope that your dog is not too big to rattle the gate and have it fall backwards because the jam should prevent him/her from pushing it forward.As I said, customer service was very prompt and I received the replacement very quickly. The only problem was we originally were told they'd be replacing the piece and did not tell us they'd be sending UPS with a packing slip to pick the old one up. I think it was fixable at home, but receiving a new product is better so I can't complain about that. The new one has the same issue, of course, because it is problem of design/quality rather than a default in a random one.For the price and if you have small enough dogs (I have a beagle and sit for a Jackabee as well), it's probably worth the the money when it's on sale. And probably not worth it, when it's not."

For the Door itself, I'd give a 5.The negative with the product is that our cat has such long hair that it blocks the transmitter on his collar from reaching the door to allow it to open, so we have taped the door to allow it to always be able to be opened by both of our cats, as we have since been adopted by another one.So far we have not had any problem with other critters coming through the door which was our concern and why we ordered a door with the electronic collar transmitter.Because we overpaid for a product that only works partially in our case, but didn't want to go through ripping it out of the wall that was built as part of a large remodel, we are only partially satisfied with the overall product."

We have a male cat that is very alpha, and as such, he marks (by brushing his forehead scent glands up against) everything and everybody in the house constantly. He also has a habit of chasing any males that come in the house. Using a Feliway diffuser has reduced his chasing behavior considerably, as well as the frequency of marking.

192455,2,"I bought the Everlasting Treat Ball (Large sized) for my 45 lb mixed breed dog, who is an aggressive chewer. This is the same dog that went through a red Kong in a day, and a Kong Extreme in a few months, and will liquefy any tennis ball in seconds. I heard great reviews on this and read about it in a book as well, and after MONTHS of debate decided to pick this up at my local pet store when it was on sale. I just gave it to her less than 20 minutes ago and she already has several chunks out of it.It did ""challenge"" her for a few minutes, as I put kibble and treats inside. She got the disk out in a few minutes and enjoyed that (chicken flavor) then went crazy getting at the food inside. So crazy, that she has taken several chunks out of the plastic already. And eaten them. Great. She did seem to have fun rolling it around getting the food out, but then went to chewing on the plastic.For a replacement, I got theEverlasting Fun Ball Largein large from the same company- and its been over a week so far and she loves that toy!!! Its basically the same thing as this instead it is actually a green ball with more room for treats inside, and made of more durable material. Also, unlike the treat ball, it does not have any ridges for my dog to bite into and rip pieces off. And, its a bit cheaper. I'm writing this after I've had that ball for at least 6 months, and she plays with it EVERY DAY and there isn't even a mark in the thing.So, all in all, skip this and go for the FUN BALL instead!!!"
134356,0,"I bought this filter for our 30 gallon tank, after our old one blew out after a thunder storm. It Worked Great for just over 30 days, I had crystal clear water and my fish were happy. One day I woke up to this really loud grinding noise, so i promptly cleaned it out 3 different times, and it still made the noise. Luckily I saved my receipt and so i brought it back and got the same exact filter, and once again it worked great for a limited amount of time, This time it was past the 60 day return policy and now its louder than ever, and has trouble starting up when its been off, or some times it just shuts off on its own. Very frustrating and Noisy! I will not be buying this filter again, I like how well it cleans but The noise and the constant breaking isn't worth it. Im going to spend the extra money and buy a canister filter in the near future!I would only recommend this product for a temporary fix!"

178720,0,Got this for my little girl. She's been wanting a frog but I didn't want to deal with a messy aquarium setup. This seemed like a fantastic idea. It WAS a great idea if only they had finished thinking it through.NOTHING holds the bottom on so moving it gets annoying because instead of using the handle (why is it even there?) you have to pick it up from the bottom.The handle that came with mine does not allow the lid to open all the way so if you need the lid to open and stay open you have to remove the handle.The dish that holds the water is too shallow. By the time you put in enough water to seep through the slits on the clear container you've filled the water tray to the brim which also hinders in moving the cage.As I stated before this would have been an excellent idea for keeping frogs if only they had put just a little more thought into it. Luckily the tadpoles we raised turned out to be tree frogs and now I'm searching for a new habitat for them as they need more vertical space and less water.
131954,0,"I LOVE Fromm pet foods and agree with an earlier review about my dog's coarse hair becoming soft and smooth after eating Fromm, but this particular variety is his worst enemy. He puts his tail between his legs and delays eating it until late in the afternoon when he just can't stand the hunger pangs anymore. Unfortunately, I had purchased a 30 lb. bag and he is a small dog. We made it (barely) through a third of a bag before I sold the remains on the cheap to a friend. Her dogs didn't care for it either, but her somewhat overweight dog ate it anyway (because she eats anything).Our local supplier of Fromm said that this variety is the least popular.Ironically, one of my CATS loves it! Must be the fish in it!Anyway, I haven't given up on Fromm foods for my dog, but I will never buy this variety again."

209989,1,"The best thing about this tent is that I can literally take it out of the bag and have it set up in ten seconds. It takes maybe thirty seconds to fold it up again and put it back in the bag. For me, this means that I'm motivated to get it out and my cat gets to enjoy being outside far more often. The tent is compact enough to fit on my small back porch but there's more than enough room inside for my cat to walk around.I have a two-year-old cat who likes the outdoors, but I don't let her roam free since I live right on a busy street. My cat is a little escape artist sometimes, but I haven't had any trouble putting her in the tent and, later, getting her back inside safely. She seems to get more relaxed in the tent each time and definitely enjoys feeling the breeze and looking around at birds. She hasn't tried to claw at the mesh. It's especially nice to put the tent on the grass in the back yard and sit outside with a book for a while.This product works exactly as I would expect it to, and it's very convenient to use. I recommend it to anyone trying to choose a portable outdoor enclosure (unless you want something really big)."

The leash hook in the carrier. It is located on the inside top middle of the carrier. Very hard to get at when you can't see inside, especially with a squirming puppy. If it was located on the bottom at either end, it would be easier.2. Use as a car seat. Attaching and unattaching the carrier is a process, not at all easy to do. There are no instructions, just pictures and that does not help.

When in automatic mode it usually stopped wherever it felt like--sometimes upside down, sometimes sideways. Sometimes it started off turning clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise.Often--probably 3 out of 4 cycles-- it dumped large amounts of litter out the left side of the unit onto the floor.We tried all of the troubleshooting ideas, varying the amount of litter, resetting the unit, plugging and unplugging--nothing worked.Neither would it function correctly when the switch was turned off and on manually.I just returned it.

36925,1,"Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball / B0002DK26MI really like food dispensing toys, because I like for dinner time to be interactive and exercising for my puppy. He sleeps through the night and during much of the day while I'm at work, so anything that encourages him to move around and exercise is a plus.This is by far my favorite food dispensing toy. There's a single hole to pour kibble in, and there's no tricky balancing act required, like with so many of these toys. When I first placed the toy down, my puppy (aged 4 months, 12 pounds), had no idea what to do with it. I rolled it around every few days and he was happy to vacuum up the food dropped by the toy, but he just didn't catch on to pushing the ball himself... until I added a couple of small, smelly, freeze-dried liver bits into the ball and then he went crazy. He absolutely loves his food ball now that he's figured out that he can make it give treats, and I always pour a couple of tiny ""surprise"" treats into the ball to mix in with his usual kibble. Even though I bought the large size, he has no trouble padding after it and pushing it around with his paws. It makes dinner time much longer and more interesting, for both of us.I have had no problems with durability with this treat, although I'm blessed with a puppy that doesn't chew much (yet!). Still, the plastic seems very sturdy, in my opinion. I also do not notice a plastic smell, although maybe it dissipated over time - we've had it for several weeks now.It you use treats in the food ball, I recommend trimming their size - we use treats for training and we cut up all the treats we buy, usually to the size of a fingernail clipping. The dog enjoys the treat taste without filling up or getting sluggish and fat. They are also much easier to mix into the kibble that way.~ Ana Mardoll"

I throw it, she brings it back and drops it and I make it sing. Once it stops singing, she sits and looks at me and I throw it again. She can make it sing on her own, and will carry this all around the house, but she loves to fetch it! This is one of the best toys I have ever bought for her."

75755,0,"This muzzle arrive in good condition and on time. It is well made. However, I did not measure my dog's muzzle before buying this product. Rather, I used the breed comparison next to each size to determine the correct size for my dog. the muzzle basket was a good size because my dog was able to open her mouth and pant comfortably. Unfortunately, the muzzle strap was a bit longer than I expected. I cannot secure the muzzle around my dog's head because it does not tighten enough to fit her head. I put the muzzle on the hole closest to her head, but she was still able to get it off in 10 seconds. I am not sure if she still would have been able to remove this muzzle if I had purchased the size below. (I bought the size 7 for Samoyeds and my dog is a Catahoula Leopard Dog)"

I got this to force him to hold it until he's let out. He's peed himself a time or two and this absorbed it. However, he is able to defecate through the tail opening, so, I actually had to narrow it somewhat. I think it's helping him learn where it's ok to go because even when he's out of the diaper we're having less problems."
58438,0,"I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys. I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it. They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater. It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around. She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her. I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity. Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x-ray in looks like something dangerous. Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess."

68046,1,"There are a few things which will make my dog drool - cheese, steak and these. She loves em and I love to give them to her. The also smell pretty decent for dog treats. They can be pretty big for a small dog and could be difficult to break for some folks. They are made in the USA (you may be surprised how many treats are made in China) and the price is great too - 5 stars!"
66331,2,"Hi, My name is Mort and I am an 8 month old lab and New Foundland mix. I love to chew. Santa brought me this for Christmas. I loved it! Mom was not happy that the ball and the treats lasted less than 8 hours in the house. Mom says I need to take better care of my toys! Not a toy for a puppy that LOVES to chew!!!"
210501,0,It works really for my cats but the urine clumps sometimes get chopped up instead of put into receptical. This is not a major problem and the litter still seems to stay pretty clean and still much better than before. The only problem I have is that the guard around the spinning pan is supposed to be held in place by the ramp that collects the litter but it seems to come off and spin around out of place. So now I have to tape it to the ramp that is holding it so it won't move.
120543,0,"Product is durable but a serious chewer can tear it up if left unsupervised. Chewing will leave small bits of hard plastic sticking up from the surface that can make it hard to throw forcefully without gloves. Bottom line: if your dog is a serious chewer, do not leave them alone with this toy."
125832,2,I tried the Hartz pads because they were considerably cheaper than the brand I usually buy (Nature's Miracle). There is NO comparison to the absorpency of the two products. The Hartz pads leak through and I found myself washing the floor and changing pads every couple of hours. Not such a bargain after all.
44788,0,"The pet fountain runs just fine, it is quiet, and there are no problems except that my water-loving cats will not drink from it. These cats jump on the sink when I brush my teeth, and are often in the tub when someone gets out of the shower, so I thought this would be great for them. I'm thinking they would like it better if the water wasn't so quiet -and was more of a splashing fountain. It's been about three weeks, and no interest. There's no convincing cats - either they like something or they don't!"

They leave a load of hair everywhere they go, and now, thanks to the furminator, I don't have anywhere near the amount of dog hair on my furniture, my clothes, or gathering in corners of my wood flooring. Sweeping up dog hair has been a daily ritual, a couple of times each day, and now it is cut by probably 50%. Anyone who has long haired dogs will love this tool. It is Great!!"
159497,1,"The first one we had lasted a really long time, (3-4 weeks) the second one (which they replaced free of charge) seemed to last half the time. Not sure if they are changing/working on the formula but this is a great toy and worth a shot for heavy chewers. Milo simply loved this toy!"
134155,0,"We had a problem with this cat food. All of my cats but one developed loose stools on this cat food. It took me several bags of cat food to figure out that it was this cat food that was causing the problem because it did not kick in right off the bat. I had been mixing this with their old dry food and I was supplementing with canned food during the transition, so it took a bit to narrow down this new food as the source. The smaller cats developed the diarrhea before the larger cats did. I believe there is just a bit too much fiber in this formulation or perhaps it is the berries in the ingredients that trigger the loose stools. I would not have a problem mixing this with Iams or Science Diet if I could figure out the threshold where the loose stools starts. For now, I'm just going to stick to supplementing with canned food, which has almost no filler in it. On a final note, the cats were not thrilled with this. They would eat it but would go for any other food in the house before they would eat this, if given a choice."
139968,1,"I have used this type of comb with the rotating teeth for several years on MYSELF! It really helps gently remove the snarls from my hair in the morning or after I wash my hair, leading to fewer split ends and silkier hair. I bought it the first time in a pet store because when I saw it I suspected it might work on my hair too and was glad that I did, given the nice results."
111827,1,"I was a little skeptical that my picky eater would like this. He always seems to know when I try to slip something in his food. He absolutely loves this stuff and eats it right off the spoon. I can't say if it works as far as helping to put on weight, since its only been a few days, but I am hopeful. Definitely worth a try!"

158257,0,"I bought this for my 2 year old bulldog Kara. It was easy to put together and the size of the kennel is great for her. However, Kara is an escape artist and this is just not strong enough and not held together enough to keep her in. I will have to buy locks or ties and tie all of the sides together so that she can not slip through the corner."
176084,2,"The ferrets love it. However, I was dissappointed in the quality. On both ends where the caps come off to put your critter in were broken.

182369,1,"It's a tennis ball and it squeaks! What more could a dog want? My two dogs love these. I agree with the other reviewers about the squeakers not always lasting, but it varies. I've had some that last months. For my dogs even after the squeak is out they still like to squeeze the air out and play with the ball so it's not a waste of money in my house. In most cases we end up losing them long before the ball or squeak gives out."
75166,1,"This is the ONLY toy my 8-year old cat plays with for more than 3 minutes at a time...and often more than once a day. He actually ""asks"" for it to be turned on! Sometimes he plays with it for so long he exhausts himself and ends up lying on his back just trying to hit it with one paw 'cause he's too tired to do much else. It's an amazing cat toy, unlike anything else on the market. Go for it!"
151507,0,"its overpriced and intentionally designed so you need another one to be effective.

By that time it was too late. A few days later we found Mr. Duck with his stuffing on the floor. Poor Mr. Duck. Bubba, our dog, really did like Mr. Duck though. It was a good relationship that Bubba and Mr. Duck had, but like so many relationships that take off quickly, it ended quickly with broken hearts and Bubba pooping cotton for three days."
53235,0,"A couple of years ago, a friend gave me one of these feeders and I loved it. It is so much fun to have the little hummers come right up to the window. But recently I put sugar water that was too hot into the feeder and it broke. Yup......not tempered glass. So when I saw the good price Amazon had on this wonderful way to watch hummingbirds, I ordered two. They arrived today but oh my, they aren't up to the quality of the original one. The suction cups are ridiculously flimsy. Thank goodness I had saved the cups from my original feeder so I was able to start using one feeder right away. But only after I spent a very long time trying to get the bottle out of the plastic bracket which seems to be made more poorly also! Never had a problem with my gift feeder! I notice that these 2 feeders were made in China. I don't know if the first one was but it was definitely better made. With all the problems with Chinese products lately, I think I will start checking the source of all my purchases!"

45030,1,"Four stars because the crate didn't come with any setup or care instructions - absolutely no information at all. After some exploring I figured out how to set it up but even just a small piece of paper would have been nice. Also other comments mentioned a pad in the bottom, but mine did not come with one.I got it because I have a 20lb cat that doesn't fit in our other carrier and I wanted something that would give him a little room but still be easy to carry. The crate seems to be really durable in general, and the size will work really well for my huge kitty. I like that it has side and top access, and also that the handles have a little padded part like a duffel bag."
143310,2,"This produce may look like a time saver, but when it runs the smallest amount of waist will kill the motor and the system will keep on reversing and keep on trying to pick it up. When it does finally do so it only will pick up half of the wait. There is no way of cleaning it. Don't waist your money on this, if you are looking for a good automatic litter box check out the Litter-Robot."
82423,2,"Not enough info in description. I know this is for a 20 gal tank but I have seen tanks of different shapes - some longer but not has wide, some shorter but deeper etc. Needs more then just the amount of water it will hold - the info needs to include the demensions of the lid so that potential purchasers will know what they are buying. Sorry this is not a comment on the actual product but on the desciption of the product, but I know of no other way to ask my question."
155442,0,I searched serveral sites for a reasonably priced Litter Box cover. This one was one of the most affordable I found. The unit was very easy to put together and is reasonably attractive for what it is. My cats seemed anxious at first so I left the door open the first day. Now they seem to be happy with the added privacy this allows.
44170,1,This pet fountain is so much better than the last one we owned. The sleek look and almost silent pump are fabulous. The only time it starts to make that gargling noise is when the water is running low. Our kitties love it too.
85265,0,"This unit works fine unfortunately my dogs keep knocking it over, I watched both of them feeding and noted that the access door is low and would work well for small dogs, so to make it work for my dogs I have had to put on bricks.Also the capacity is less then 25lbs"
170973,0,The product itself is very simple and my dog absolutely loves it. She slept in it comfortably for a 3 hour ride and didn't bother me to sit on my lap (a real plus!) The only reason I gave only 3 stars is that installation is not as straight forward as you would think. I have a full size pick up with plenty of room but I had to rig up something to keep the back part on.
160551,2,My cats have showed no interest whatsoever in this toy. But I think if I remove the corrugated and ball I'll have a nice palette for mixing paints.
74001,2,My cats absolutely hate this product. Im so sad because it looks like an amazing idea and effective too if I could get it in their mouth.
121743,1,"Works so far (some web indications of variable/short life - let's see). Mounting is accurately described (area adhesive - stick on glass) This makes unit non-transferable. Web suggests support from below tank and don't use adhesive - yeah, heat transfer may be a little less, but heater remains removable. Note: attempts to remove adnesive bonded heater will likely destroy heater !!!"
154090,0,"This is a wonderful toy! I have a 4 month old puppy who keeps himself highly entertained for around 20 minutes with his cube.I can handle it being noisy, but my only complaint is that it's hard to clean the interior. That's why it's 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. The instructions tell you to turn and pull the center piece, but I haven't been able to do so and my neighbor who has a mini cube also hasn't been able to pull it out. I've stopped using it until I can find a way to clean the interior."
39678,1,"I love this product! I was skeptical about ordering it based off of some bad reviews that I had read, but figured I would give it a shot. I am so HAPPY that I did! It is so easy to use, and clean up is a breeze! There were comments that litter spills out, SO NOT TRUE! As long as you assemble properly there will be no problems. This is literally the best thing I have ever purchased on Amazon (and trust me I buy A LOT)! If you're hesitant at all about buying this product, don't be!"
179077,1,"We live in New York City and have two cats - younger cats, 18 months and about a year old - needless to say, it would be really nice if we could rid ourselves of the litter box forever. We had originally purchased a cat toilet-training system from another company - it was not nearly as good as this one, in fact, it was a total failure - flimsy plastic, and you couldn't punch out the insert gradually like you can this one. At this point we are almost there - we have punched out about half of the insert, and the cats are acually perching on the toilet seat and aiming for the hole - just incredible. We are very happy! The plastic is strong and easy to clean -"
117476,0,"The ingredients in Joint Max Triple Strength seem just right for my 9 year old golden (who is a bit arthritic) and my 6 year old golden with a reconstructed knee. But part way through the first tub they both began to refuse to eat them as a separate treat. In order to finish the tub I had to hide them in their dinner. They are typical retrievers and are not picky, so i don't know why they simply refused to eat this product any longer (the chews were properly stored and only a weeks worth were removed from the container and inner bag at a time). Of course you may or may not have this issue with your dog."
57369,2,"I have used Frontline for years on my cats and it worked great. I could smell the product as I applied it to each cat, and the flees stayed away. Now i apply the Frontline to the cats and nothing happens. My cats are still scratching like crazy as if I had applied nothing on them but water. I can no longer smell the medicine as I apply it to the cats. Frontline must have changed its formula and it was not for the best."
78424,1,"I was hesitant to buy this because I wasn't sure if it would make a difference, if I was just throwing away my money. But boy, has it made a difference! Walks used to be something we did because it was good for our dog, good for us, but we spent half the walk with him pulling or us yanking him back. That stress caused the walks to be really frustrating and stressful.With the Easy Walk Harness our dog hardly ever pulls and when he does it is very easy to correct, the most subtle of movements gets his attention. It's great!Regarding size: I measured him before we bought the harness to make sure we were getting the right size. I calculated him to be a large but on the high side, nearly an XL, so I measured twice and he was a couple of inches short of an XL so I went for the Large. I'm glad I didn't go for the XL in the end because I had to adjust the L quite a bit to make it small enough to fit him. So, if you're thinking maybe you should go up a size, don't!"

10759,0,"Our Chihuahua-Terrier mix absolutely LOVES this toy. But beware......we have to have supervised play with her while using this toy. As in the ""Disappointed"" review she will chew a hole in the toy within 5 minutes if left unattended.

121739,0,"I purchased this at the end of April in 2011 and received it and put it to use in May 2011. It quit working in August of 2012. I would have thought that it would have lasted a bit longer than a year and a third.It did it's job when it worked. The sticking power of the mat is only so-so, perhaps the heat melts the glue? I had it under the tank for my bearded dragon. There was no water and it was turned off for several hours every night. The mat was not damaged in any way that I could see, it just quit. The worst part is I am not entirely sure when it quit because I didn't have the foresight to check it regularly.Oh well."
88878,0,"Sometimes you luck out and other times you get burned. I followed the directions exactly and the pump was not quiet. When I grasped the inlet valve located in front of the pump strainer the vibration noise lessened so I attached a vice grip and that made the noise tolerable but scared off the cat. Now I've devised a lo fi solution consisting of a 2 inch thick rubber gasket , a saucer shaped rock and 2 pieces of light switch insulator material which works just as well but the cat is still wary. I've noticed that replacement charcoal filters are expensive 3.50 each and need installation every 4-6 weeks. The power supply for this is 9 watts supplying a 2 watt motor and it's not an A/C/D/C adaptor but a 120 V a/c to 12 volt a/c adaptor which can also explain the motor noise. I know direct current is quieter than alternating current by the nature of the wave forms. If you run this thing 24/7 expect to use 78 kilowatts per year or 6.5 kw per month. 9 Watt x 24hrs x 30days. 6.5 kw is how much power usage I average per day. The product thus will not be winning any energy star awards. If you only run the motor 8 hours a day you can cut those numbers by 67% but still an ongoing not insignificant expense. Let's talk about maintenance. You're supposed to totally break the unit down/including the pump once a week and clean it. How much is your time worth? and do you have enough chores to do as it is? are valid questions to ask yourself in this busy time we live in. [...] I have however decided to keep mine. Here are the positives. Your cat gets filtered water. You don't have to fill his dish with water twice a day which saves time in the short run. You probably can get away with cleaning the thing out once every 3 weeks. I have sensitive ears but even though I have the unit near my bedside, I don't run the pump at night. As previously mentioned the pump may be considered quiet but it's by no means silent. I had to jury rig mine and it's still not silent. The cat seems to like it. Too much of a pain to send it back and incur return shipping charges. Make sure you keep the fountain topped off with water. Oh yeah, I also water my bird using this filtered water so he gets better than tap too. I'm gonna make lemonade out of this lemon but still stand by the 2 star rating. [I've had this fountain for 6 weeks now and have raised my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I've gone through a few cleaning cycles and like the way the motor comes apart for cleaning. I believe i'm actually starting to like this product and the rock and gasket are now gone. My cat appears healthier so the little bit of trouble and expense are worth it. The product is really not that difficult to maintain. The reservoir's function is to keep the level in the fountain to within 1/2 inch of the top. I've found that it's better to keep it filled to about 1/4 inch from the top. When the level get's too low the pump will begin to cavitate(sounds like a little choo choo train) and that means it's sucking on air which is not good. I'm glad I bought it now.]"
23097,1,"I have to say that this item works wonderfully. I'll keep the review short and to the point with it's pro's and con's (my personal experience anyway).Pros+ Grabs all of the extra undercoat. I can literally get handfuls of hair after one session of combing.+ Very sturdy/quality craftsmanship. It has a good weight to it.Cons- My cats ( I have two )tend to get tired of the combing pretty fast. I'm not sure if it pulls too much or if its just the repetitive motion that annoys them after awhile.- Sometimes it kind of loosens the dry skin/dandruff underneath the coat making things flaky.In the end, this product definitely delivers and is worth getting. Cats can be picky about it, but it's worth annoying them a little to save your house from being taken over by cat hair."

It was heavy and hard to squeak, so I thought it might be too tough or her, but I was wrong! I have jolly balls for my horses and they are quite durable, but don't get the dedicated chewing that a terrier can inflict. It might be better or a fetch toy for a larger dog or less hardy chewer."

168738,1,"This product is exactly what our Rhodesian Ridgeback needs. She has hereditary hip dysplasia which causes some soreness and stiffness in her right hip. She is still young, so we need maximum protection and prevention. I have done hours of research on this specific topic, and we choose Dasuquin. The reason for the price is this product is one of the only of its kind guaranteed by the FDA to have the exact amounts of nutrients stated. Other brands can be misleading and are not regulated in being forced to provide what is listed. We have been using Dasuquin since the beginning of 2009 and will be indefinitely. We saw immediate positive response and have continued seeing the same quality over the years... no more limping, no more hopping or holding a leg up, no more pain after laying down for a while, nothing. Price, convenience, etc. are not worth such a serious, painful issue with our dog.As a side note, this vitamin requires one tablet a day for our 90lb dog... whereas many other brands that are 'cheaper' require 5 or 6 tablets a day to get the same doses of nutrients. So, in the end, the price ends up actually quite similar or sometimes even cheaper.Large Dogs (60lbs and over): Glucosamine 900mg, MSM 800mg (per tablet)"

66283,0,"I purchased this bed for my 90 lb shepherd twice. i used this bed for about three years. Dog loves it. I bought it for him as he has back problems (spondylosis). However in the three years, he has had two accidents and urinated on the bed. The cover is NOT waterproof. The interior core was soaked with urine. I tried hosing it down the first time and letting it air dry outside. It took forever to dry and got black small spots (mold). Had to throw it out. The second incident happened less than a month after I bought the second new bed. It is winter so trying to hose it down outside isnt even an option. It would be a five star bed if it had a waterproof cover. Otherwise, its s waste of money."
150020,0,"I have to admit, this product is great for giving off beneficial UVA rays. As for providing heat, a regular house bulb does the job just fine. I tested and compared the temperature difference in the tank with a thermometer and there are no significant changes whether using a regular 100W house bulb and these Zoo Med Repti Basking Bulbs. Regular house bulbs are much cheaper to buy. If you ARE planning to invest in tank fixtures, you should buy a bulb that gives off both UVA + UVB rays, both of which are very important to your reptile's health. A good example of this product would be the Power Sun UVA Bulb from ZooMed. For heat, regular house bulbs about 100W should do the trick. For other reptile care tips go to www.reptilecare.com"
112877,1,"I bought this for one of my cats because she HATES having her claws trimmed.The first time I put them on, I trimmed the claws too short which resulted in her being able to pull them off sooner than she should have.The next time, though, I trimmed off just the tip of her claws. Almost all of them stayed on for nearly 7 weeks! Yes, she tried to pry them off once in awhile, just like she would with the normal nail sheath if it didn't come off on its own, but she wasn't able to pry them off. One of them lasted over 8 weeks. I cut it off at that point, trimmed her nails, and put a fresh set on.The glue holds VERY well if you get it down in there like you're supposed to. They stay on very well, again, as long as you don't trim too much of the nail off. I just put the third set on my cat this morning, and I'm still on the first tube of glue! You do get better with practice just like with anything else. So, don't be discouraged if the first set doesn't last as long as expected, just figure out what went wrong and correct it if you can.These are great, I highly recommend them. They don't interfere with her balance or anything like (shudder) declawing would for those who would even consider declawing. Plus, they allow me to trim her claws every 6 - 8 weeks instead of the 4 - 5 I do my other cats. All my cats are about 1 year old now, so still young. They look great on her as well. I hope someday she'll be better about having her claws trimmed and I won't need these anymore, but until then, I'm sure glad to have them!The only thing I can even think of that might be considered a ""con"" for these is that you don't always find the ones that eventually come off. But, that's not really a problem with the product itself, just a function of it's necessarily small size ;)If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would."
213805,2,My dog a Chi and is scared of it. The pieces are so big that he is scared to get into the box. I tried staying there with him and hope he would go out of desperation. He would not use the litter. I tried moving his feces to the box when he did it on my floor. He still showed to desire to use the litter. I feel it was a total waste of my money.
167356,0,"This system is simple to use and affordable compared to most CO2 systems, but if you're willing to put in a little effort and research you could build your own CO2 fermentation system that works just as well (if not better) for a fraction of the cost. Still, not everyone is willing to build their own, and this system is a decent compromise. It's also pretty safe, since the CO2 injection is slow and gradual and won't cause fast pH drops. Make sure you have a decent buffering capacity just in case.My only criticism is the ""activator"" and ""stabilizer"" packets which Hagen sells for this product - they are too expensive for what they are (basically yeast and baking powder) and a home-made mixture seems to work better for me anyway. With Hagen's mix, I couldn't get more than about 9 ppm CO2 in my 10 gallon tank (about 3 - 4 bubbles per minute) but a simple mixture of baker's yeast, sugar, and water gets me twice that and lasts just as long (2-3 weeks). Most people aim for 15 - 25 ppm or so (but no higher).In any case, if you have adequate light (2.5 watts per gallon or more), your plants will benefit from CO2 injection and Hagen's system does what it advertises.One tip: buy a simple air valve for the tubing so you don't get a siphoning mess when you're re-filling the CO2 cansiter."

I tried the ""advance"" button (BTW, that has about a two-minute delay before it actually executes after pressing the button), but the feeder constantly stopped midway between two tray openings rather than fully opening the next one. I tried a new battery, same result. This thing had potential, but it is poorly made, and not something I would ever trust to feed my kitty for even a day or two. I send it back to Amazon, and fully expect them to resolve the issue...I think I have only done one Amazon return before, but it went well."

10496,1,We have tried several varieties for my old cat and this is the only one he would EVER take. He licks it right out of the tube (no wrestling required) and it really helps him to feel better. I don't use anything else now even if they are less expensive because I know they will be impossible to get him to take and I don't want to waste my money! This one is great.
194206,2,"I bought a Thundershirt and an Anxiety Wrap for my two Airedales. While both products worked in helping to calm the dogs during a thunderstorm, the Thundershirt was much easier to use. Just place it on the back of the dog, then fasten the velcro straps. No problem at all.The Anxiety Wrap, however, was almost impossible to get on an already anxious dog. You have to place it over the dog's head, then pull the legs up through the leg holes, then fasten. I know it sounds easy and the video at their excellent web site makes it look easy, but it isn't, particularly with a dog that's worked up. Getting the Anxiety Wrap on stressed out the dog almost as much as the storm did!Both products worked, but the design of the Thundershirt is much more user-friendly. Having used both products, I strongly recommend Thundershirt over Anxiety Wrap."
18798,0,"As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line, I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it, I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix, and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still, our dog has tossed it around, and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable."
144782,0,"It's a great idea, play ""fetch"" with your dog without having to handle the ball. But this device is a little difficult to control. It doesn't ""let go"" of the ball where you think it will, at the end of the extension of the throw. It's a little sooner than that, so the ball's trajectory is unpredictable. The product warns that you have to have a large area with no obstacles to use it. This is somewhat limiting for a city dweller. I am hoping that with practice I can become more precise with it. I would like to see this product developed into a version with better control so it can be used in an apartment. Nevertheless, it's a fun toy to play with, and at such a low price there's no risk in trying it."

192356,0,"We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!"
117541,2,I bought this for my dog who weighs a little over 12 pounds. The support rack for basket is very week & dropped to wheel top during first ride in parking lot. If I had taken it on the road or for more than a few feet my dog could have been seriously injured. The carrier storage design is good but support resulting safety issues are scary!
116717,0,"First of all, if you are buying this product, my heart goes out to you for having to deal with CRF in your pet, and please be hopeful--even very severe cases of renal failure can be stabilized. My cat was dx'd with Stage IV CRF so severe that euthanasia was insisted upon by two vets...and is now stable and doing fine over a year later.I use Epakitin, but I *alternate* it with safer phosphorus binders that are more of a hassle to dose (Mylanta) because my cat developed metabolic alkalosis from exclusive use of Epakitin.Epakitin is milled calcium carbonate (teacher's chalk) which binds phosphorus. I think Epakitin is safe for animals in the *early stages* of kidney failure rather than acute or late stage renal failure, in which carbonate levels can rise quickly and be fatal. All animals in kidney failure require maintenance phos binders with their food, but if your pet is in Stage IV of renal failure, Epakitin may suddenly and dangerously raise carbonate levels, raising the blood pH (metabolic alkalosis)--resulting in a sick, anorexic and eventually comatose pet--ask your veterinarian about the potential for alkalosis before administering this medicine. I would especially caution anyone with a Stage IV CRF pet in an unstable condition, with vomiting and bowel trouble, from using Epakitin on a 2X daily basis.About using Epakitin instead of Mylanta because of ""taste"" and ease of use. The most powerful phos binders are aluminum and magnesium hydroxide, found in most OTC antacids. These compounds convert to water rather than a base when they bind phosphorus, so they are more likely to keep your pet's blood in a safe pH range. I know many dogs fancy mint (eat your toothpaste, anyone?) but cats ABHOR the safer Maalox and Mylanta (""Classic"" is least minty) and you will naturally want to turn to Epakitin when they shred your face trying to dose them with Mylanta. Not so fond of it myself. But it is the first thing I grab when I have heartburn. So I have to say ""too bad, so sad,"" and syringe Mylanta. I've learned the hard way to wrap the cat barbershop-style in a thick towel with a strong binder clip behind the head and use a 5 ml syringe with a solid plastic plunger (rubber plunger syringes stick and do not last). Every cat in the world will knock a syringe across the room and whatever you squirt in their mouth turns them Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist."" The Mylanta ordeal just takes a few minutes, and then the cat and I go on with our lives.If your pet is really sick, *please* be careful with Epakitin and do not administer it twice daily--I reckon you just dropped some serious $ at the vet and won't be having labs checked in the short time it takes for alkalosis to develop.I highly recommend Vetoquinol's other product, Azodyl, even though it's ridiculously expensive. The magic ingredient in it is psyllium husk, so if you are financially strapped you can get psyllium husk from the health food store for pennies. My 17 year-old CRF cat kept crashing until I started mixing Azodyl in her food with 1/4 tsp of extra psyllium added."
37707,0,"This litter box is sort of OK. The tabs that hold the top onto the bottom are rather difficult to work and make firmly connected. Once it is turned over, one had to shake it abut rather vigorously to get the contents to loosen and fall into the drawer. It is better than my old one, with all the scooping that created dust, and not as expensive as the electric one that has costly filters that have to be replaced, I guess there is no exceptional way to deal with litter boxes."

24408,0,"Our 45lb lab/shepherd mix LOVES to chew. She recently started chewing on ""her"" chair we have in her room (thankfully it is an inexpensive fold out chair) so I decided to take this toy back out of retirement. We got it for her a few months ago and she really loved it, but after weeks of hard chewing the ends started to get sharp bits sticking out. I was worried because it was causing her gums to bleed but it doesn't seem like she is in any type of pain and she really seems to love it so I'm letting her have another trial run tonight. I'm going to get her a nylabone ""souper"" next."
45989,0,"I purchased this bed for our lab mix and basset mix that love to lay in front of the space heater. Out of the package, my first impression was ""I can't believe I paid $50 for this!"" The outer cover, altough it looks very fuzzy, is so thin you can literally watch TV through the material. The egg crate padding is not the quality that you would put on your own bed, it seems more like the accoustic grade egg crate. The heating pad does warm the bed nicely and our dogs love that. I do not expect this bed to last long, however, we have only had it for a few hours so it is a bit early to say. I definately think for the price they could beef up the quality. Would I purchase this bed again? No."
156084,2,"I bought this for my Golden-doodle, who is 18 months old and an AVID chewer. This looked to be sturdy and durable, and from the reviews I read, money well-spent. Boy, was I wrong! Within 2 hours it was trash, torn to shreds. A better buy is the Everlasting Fun Ball, which is a few bucks more expensive, but well worth the difference!If your dog is a moderate chewer, then this one may be for you...but it was a waste of money for us!"
71520,0,"Before I bought this, I had the ""hammock-style"" barrier in my back seat. It kept them from falling on the floor and was supposed to keep them contained in the back seat. My dogs quickly figured out they could jump over it and into the front seat.So I bought this Kurgo Backseat Barrier, which is higher and sturdier. I don't understand why everyone is having such a hard time with installation. I read the directions, and it was self explanatory. I thought it was easy to install, but the clips that are used to hook under the seat aren't very big and are kind of flimsy. It still works though.It has kept my dogs in the back seat, however, I have one energetic pup who has figured out she can put her paws on top of it and peer over. Although she hasn't jumped over it yet, I'm very sure she could.Overall I'm happy with it. It looks good, is durable, and does the job. It's not 100% guaranteed to keep your dogs in the back seat, but it surely has cut down on their crazy back-and-forth jumping that used to drive me nuts while driving. I do think it's a little overpriced though but there's not much else out there to choose from in the way of backseat barriers, at least for sedans."
213490,0,"I've tried a lot of different cat litters to see what works best. I love the smell of cedar wood, so I was really hopeful of this cedar cat litter. Unfortunately, it doesn't mask the smell of the cats' bowel movements. It also doesn't clump the urine properly, as it falls apart when scooped. There's clearly some sort of additive that tries to get the cedar to clump together, but it ends up just being this slimy, sticky goo that's not only disgusting and smelly, but DOESN'T ACTUALLY HOLD TOGETHER.What I've found does work is putting a layer of pine pellets at the bottom of the litter box then covering it with crystal litter. The crystal litter mummifies the feces so the smell is gone quickly, and it evaporates the urine so you don't even have to scoop out the disgusting urine monstrosities. The only thing is that the crystal litter does not evaporate all the urine before it soaks down to the bottom, so there's always some wetness at the bottom of the litter box. Hence the pine pellets, which soak the urine right up and masks the smell immediately. The pine litter comes as hard pellets and when a liquid touches them they soak it up and fall apart into saw dust, so you know what litter has been used and what hasn't, and you can easily tell when it needs to be changed. Using the pine litter alone is not effective at masking the feces smell though. In fact if only the pine pellets are used the feces smell is powerful. So I've found, through lots of trial and error, that the best combination is the pine pellets at the bottom and the crystal litter at the top. As far as the cedar chips go, if they came in pellets in stead of flakes I think they could be just as effective as the pine pellets, but in the flake form they're useless."

It doesn't really fly, it falls with style. The hang time is not even half of a regular plastic frisbee, and my dog knows the difference. She doesn't even have the same interest in this.

34817,2,"Yes, a lot of rabbits like this type of food. Mine did too and it made her sick and I had to take her to the vet. Now I know this is the worst type of food. My vet told me to never get this type of rabbit food ever again. Seeds especially can be dangerous to there digestive tract and cause serious problems. This is not what rabbits should eat, please look at timothy hay based pellets with no added ""treats"". Yes, they do like this, but it can cause horrible, painful digestion problems and impacted bowls. Rabbits need unlimited hay and pellets should be timothy based. The exception is growing young rabbits, they may have alfalfa based pellets but this kind of food is never good for any rabbit. If your rabbit gets constipated and has tiny poos or stops going altogether it is a serious health issue that can cause a painful death-they really need hay and a good pellet food to prevent problems.some info below from the house rabbit society (they have great health info about rabbits-litter training,housing,etc)A good quality rabbit pellet DOES NOT contain dried fruit, seeds, nuts, colored crunchy things or other things that are attractive to our human eyes, but very unhealthy to a rabbit. Rabbits are strict herbivores, and in nature they rarely get fruit, nuts or other such fatty, starchy foods. The complex flora of the cecum can quickly become dangerously imbalanced if too much simple, digestible carbohydrate is consumed--especially if the diet is generally low in fiber. The result is often ""poopy butt syndrome,"" in which mushy fecal matter cakes onto the rabbit's behind. This a sign of cecal dysbiosis, which can foment much more serious health problems.A good quality rabbit pellet should have at least 22% crude fiber, no more than approximately 14% protein, about 1% fat and about 1.0% calcium. Check the label on the rabbit pellets before you buy. Most commercial pellets are alfalfa-based, which means they're higher in calories and lower in fiber than timothy-based pelletsPerhaps the single most important item in the rabbit diet is grass HAY, and it should be fed in unlimited quantities to both adults and baby rabbits. A rabbit fed only commercial rabbit pellets does not get enough long fiber to keep the intestines in good working order. The long fibers in the hay push things through the gut and keep the intestinal muscles in good tone. In addition to keeping the intestinal contents moving at the rate at which nature intended, hay may also help prevent intestinal impactions caused by ingested hair or other indigestible items. (For more information on problems associated with slowed intestinal function, please see [...]Alfalfa or clover hays, although tasty for the rabbit, are too rich in protein and calcium to be fed ad libitum. Instead, offer fresh grass hays such as timothy, oat, coastal, brome, Bahia or wheat. If you can't find good quality hay locally, you may wish to mail order hay from Oxbow Hay Company or American Pet Diner. Oxbow carries the coarser ""first cut"" timothy hay that is higher in fiber. American Pet Diner carries both first cut and the softer, more fragrant ""second cut"". Second cut hay is lower in fiber, but some rabbits who refuse to eat the (putatively healthier) high-fiber first cut will often eagerly accept second cut hay. Less fiber is better than none at all!Fresh, moist greens are about as important as hay in maintaining a healthy intestine. Try broccoli, dark leaf lettuces, kale, parsley, carrots (with tops!), endive, escarole, dill, basil, mint, cilantro, culantro, spinach"

31438,1,"We have had a serious problem with our cats' marking behavior for several years. They would pretty much pee on anything vertical (walls, furniture, appliances, etc). We had tried several remedies without much success. Last fall, we remodeled our family room and we were determined to keep the new room ""pristine"". We heard about Feliway and decided to give the diffuser a try.Feliway actually worked! We put 1 diffuser in the living room (same old carpet and furniture as before) and 1 in the remodeled family room (all new materials). Marking stopped in both rooms, as well as in areas that are immediately adjacent. In the past 6 months or so that we've used Feliway, we've had 1 episode of a cat peeing on some papers, so the problem isn't 100% cured, but the improvement over daily marking is huge. (We did get a recurrence of some vertical spraying in 1 room when we were late in refilling the diffuser. Refilling it stopped the behavior again).Feliway isn't cheap, but it still costs less than cleaning or replacing damaged furniture, paint and carpets. It's no work --just plug it in-- and the house smells good again. Hallelujah."
81430,2,I purchased this vest for my 75 pound lab. it fits fine and floats. that's about it. The durability of this item is sub sub par.

I would recommend if you have an active dog that swims and plays spend the extra money and get something way more durable.
84348,0,This product works as stated with some comments.1) It appeared to be broken when it is really just out of battery power. The little screen will still be lit but it won't dispense. If you replace the battries it will work again.2) The programming interface is not intuitive but if you have the instruction guide it works just fine. Don't lose it!3) It gobbles up batteries! I would suggest rechargeables.4) I agree that it dispenses really large portions. I only have one cat and once a day feeding on the lowest setting is enough.But I only have to worry about little Charlie once a month so it's a great product!

I've put her favorite soft dog pillows on top of it to get her to enjoy it. She'll lie on it for a day, then by the next day, she's pulled off her favorite dog pillow and she's sleeping on the concrete floor again.

I am kind of disappointed about that because, after reading all the glowing reviews on here, I thought for sure this would be a big hit. Unfortunately, not so...

My other cats sometimes will perk up to it for a minute or two, then just lose interest and walk away. Bummer!"

I don't like the tent-like opening because it makes it difficult to slide the box in and out. And if you have an automatic LM900 Mega like me, you can't even flip up the receptacle cover to take out the receptacle! Again, Littermaid has the most ridiculous designs."
52514,0,This very pretty toy just can not stand up to a parrot's beak. My Sun Conure tore it apart in one day. So I made several different toys from it for my cockatiels.
120665,0,"The product itself works well. The smell only subsides temporarily. I had to buy my own hose spray due to my package not including the actual hose attachment as stated. That is probably my biggest complaint about this purchase. In all fairness to the company, I never complained to them directly but, I didn't feel like going through the hoops."
166405,2,"It is a wonderful idea, but this model does not work. I tried it on 2 dogs and 7 cats all with different hair lengths. I got two fleas who were just stunned. I really really wanted it to work but it just didn't. Even when I touched the tines I felt nothing, not even a tingle. SAD"

187284,1,"We've ordered two of these... the 36"" and the 42"" for our Husky. From what we had read on various sites on the internet, the 36"" should've been fine. However, he'd wake up every morning and start crying (his crate is in our room). As soon as I'd let him out he'd stretch out and go back to sleep. So, about a month ago, I convinced my husband to get the 42"" crate, and: Problem solved! No more crying- he fits great and has lots of room! We still have the 36"" as our ""travel crate"" since it'll fit better in my car (civic sedan) and if worse comes to worse he can fit in it, just not as comfy. He'll be one year old this month (we think)."
94829,2,"I purchased this collar October '09 and when I tried to refill it today, it just leaked the charge out around a seam. So it lasted just over three months. I did not register the item within the 15-30 day window so the 1 year warranty is void. I don't know if they would have covered it, there's lots of wiggle room in the wording of the warranty. It did not get rough treatment. I used the same brand to recharge it. It worked for my mini-schnauzer's barking but not as well as the shock collar set low. When it spritzed him he acted way more ""shocked"" than with the actual shock collar, like he imagined a viper hissing at him."
132331,2,"I am very cautious about what I give my dog and always watch her carefully when giving her a treat she can chew. I am always worried about her choking on something. I heard everyone rave about greenies and decided to give one to my dog to try. She was 6 months old and I gave her a petite one for her weight (as the recommendation said). My dog is really careful about chewing her treats before swallowing. She really liked the greenie, but as was chewing it, the treat got really slimey, and a big chunk accidentally slid down her throat and she swallowed it. She then gagged and vomitted it back up. After the incident, I threw away the other greenies I had bought and never gave her another one. Now I have been hearing many incidents of greenies causing obstructions and it just re-iterates to me that I've made the right decision in not feeding them to my dog anymore!"

I will either break a milkbone in half and wedge it in there, or put some of his food in there with peanut butter in the end so he has to work at it a bit. He really likes it."

71519,0,"I read all of the reviews before deciding to purchase this pet barrier. After looking at everything available and comparing price this came up as my best option. The seats in my Honda Civic are relatively tall so I thought I could attach this thing a little higher on the seats and I'd be good to go. Well, I left my german sheppard in the back seat for a few minutes and I came back and she was sitting in the front seat. Even though there was only about 6 inches of clearance she managed to get over. The top part of the barrier with the window was crumpled down when I looked at it. If you have a dog who wants to be in the front seat I recommend getting one of the metal cagelike barriers for the car. It will save you a lot of time and hassle.IMPORTANT:The bottom of this barrier attaches under your seat with a closed plastic hook. Make sure you have a place under your seat to attach a hook before purchasing this."

95369,0,"It worked out well on my cat at first. She didn't really notice it was there. After she did though she proceeded to pull it off. The collar snaps together fairly well, but it is easy to adjust the size to be big enough for her to slip her head through. She's not used to collars, so it's not like she'd like it anyway."

62932,0,"I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online. The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall. The only issues I have had are with the delivery. One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere. The delivery time is also something that needs improvement. I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th. It took a week before it even left the facility. It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery. Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly."

63503,2,"I would love this product if it didn't break so easily. I never saw my cats go as crazy for a cat toy as they did with the fishing rod so I really wish it worked. I even brought the first one back hoping it was just a defect but the second one I got in exchange broke even quicker. I tried an hour to try and fix it but to no avail. I left a message with the manufacturer of this product, Bamboo Pets, but no one called me back. I am so frustrated!"

168901,0,"Honestly I am at my wits end. I read all these amazing reviews and my vet also suggested Dasuquin but maybe the damage is just too much. He is also taking pain meds that are not working well either. My GSP is going on 9 and has rapidly declined in the last year from his many antics and daily off leash woods walks. He has fallen off cliffs and out of trees so maybe I'm expecting too much. This will be my 3rd try...I just can't stand to see how he stiffens up at night. I have no idea how he still runs during his happy time in the woods. His knees are the main problem from what xrays reveal and surgery won't help since he won't rest enough to heal properly. Apparantly both knees have been torn through the years. He sits at such an odd angle and his legs give out at time but dogs just don't complain like us! We'll see if the third time is the charm!The German Shorthair Pointer is a wonderful dog but never again...they require an enormous amount of exercise, even at his age. Hunting is always on his mind and I want him to be mobile enough to do his thing until the end &lt;3"

192802,0,I've never tasted this (or any other dog food) so I can't speak to the taste or what it does once it's ingested. But our pet store recommended putting a small amount on top of our puppy's dry food to get him to eat. He is more interested in this canned food than his dry food and sometimes leaves only the dry food behind. He seems very healthy...no complaints.
152315,0,My first battery expired after 8 weeks or use. The 'correction' setting was 2nd highest and the collar was shut-off at night; worn virtually all day. I may try to reduce the power setting as the dog is now 'trained'. The PetSafe Training Guide advised a 3 to 6 month life. A little short of expectation.
216750,1,"We have Vizslas at home with chonic ear infections. They love water and their long ears tend to hold the water and they are susceptible to infection. We tried antibiotics and other vet recommended salves and balms, but the best preventative method is a flush with Malacetic Otic at least twice a week and up to daily.I personally don't like the smell, but its effective and that's what really matters for my pups.We pull back the ear flap and squirt a small amount directly into the ear canal. We hold the dog's head and massage the base of the ear for about 30 seconds to loosen the wax. Let the dog shake it out and break it up (may want to do this outside if there's a lot of build up). Wipe inside the ear flap and just inside the canal with cotton wool (we unroll cotton balls). Poke as deep as you and the dog are comfortable."
88307,1,I purchased this originally for our cat when we switched her from wet to dry food to make sure she was drinking enough water. The cat loves to drink and play from time to time with the water stream. In addition we got a dog and the now both share. The dog definitely adds much more dirt and debris than the cat but the filters work well and cleaning is fast and simple. Highly recommended as you won't be disappointed!

107496,0,"It may be just my dog's fault, but my rat terrier has it down to an art to bite it right ont he seam of the ball and break it in half. Several years ago, these balls didn't do that and lasted me awhile. These will last me anywhere between like 30 minutes to a couple days. I think they're seam quality has deteriorated.

There is no other pan that fits this size cage. I Tried to buy a metal one from JB Pet and it was lower quality than HVAC metal and came damaged 2 times from UPS.Also, I have a water bottle attached to the side which drips occasionally onto the ABS pan.

7902,0,"once in place, the gate is very sturdy, which is somewhat surprising because the assembly doesn't seem particularly great in terms of quality. i do worry at some point that parts of the wood will break, especially the latch which, as another reviewer mentioned, is fairly hazardous to fingertips.edit: while i initially gave it 3 stars, i would now give it 2. this gate has held up somewhat poorly. i do not think it will last much more than a few months. it's held together by these little bolts that seem to loosen with everyday use, instead of screws which could be re-tightened. if you have this gate in one place and only rarely move it, then i'd recommend it at this price. but, if like us, you move this gate in and out of place multiple times every day, i can't recommend it. it won't hold up!"

It seems durable and sturdy, but my dog chewed on it for about 5 seconds and got bored with it so now it's just sitting in the middle of the floor where she likes to leave her boring toys. If I move it to the side she will sure enough bring it back to the middle of the floor to show her intense displeasure.If your pups just like mindless destructive chewing with no reward, such as mental stimulation or flavor, then give it a try. Otherwise, skip this one. Nylabone has better products."
89768,0,my dog loves this toy but within 5 minutes I had to take it away because there was stuffing everywhere and he was eating it.I purchased the large size because I have a 40 pound 5 month old pit bull puppy. Within 30 seconds he already had a hole in it and within 5 minutes there was stuffing everywhere including his stomach. Then about 2 minutes later the squeaker was out. boo! He was so sad when I took it away but it's just not durable enough to be a dog toy. maybe a kitty cat toy!by the way..it's not just that my dog is rough. his favorite toy is a $2 stuffed bone from target and it has lasted 2 months!
197522,0,I love this dress but I had to return it because it was too small for my 3.8lb Yorkie. The return process was very easy.
145085,2,"Maybe I have a weird puppy, but my 3 month old ShihTzu loves the taste of this spray. We were having an issue with him chewing on the legs of our kitchen table. When we spray the table legs with this spray, he goes after the legs even more. We even tried spraying it on his waste to keep him from licking it, but that didn't work either. Since it doesn't work, I'm not sure it's good for anything else, so I guess I'll throw it away unless I can use it as a glass cleaner or something! Maybe some puppies don't like the taste, but I don't think I'd recommend it to another ShihTzu owner."
85228,2,"ConairPro Turbo-GroomIII kept this product (Dog Clippers) a while before rating it because being new at clipping dogs, I wanted to be fair. First of all this clipper will heat up to the can't touch at the head end of it at all (half the way through). Second it does not cut the dogs hair to my satisfaction. It certainly does not do well enough to do half of one large dog without heating up. It has been properly maintained, but doesn't even measure up to the job that my 30 year old Oster does that I had purchased many years ago to do kids hair. That one not being as big will take longer of course, but will trim a whole big dog well and does not heat up at all."

153201,2,"I have 2 cats, a boy and a girl. and neither one uses the CatGenie as intended. The boy has CH which causes him to walk with a shaky, jerky gait. He uses a litter box with no problem other than flinging litter a lot. The girl had been de-clawed by a previous owner, and has temperamental litter box habits.My problems have been:Litter trackingExcessive activation under ""Cat Activation Mode""Problem peeing while in the cleaning cycle, due to above complaintDe-clawed cats may not tolerate the feel of the pellets on their pawsNoiseSmellsFirst, sound and smell: We live in a small New York apartment, so the CatGenie had to go outside our bathroom, i ran the water lines through the wall. When it goes off, it is loud enough to be annoying, about half way between air conditioner and vacuum cleaner in loudness. IT is loud enough to wake me up. Smells come in two varieties, feces/urine and the smell of the solution itself. The solution has a smell that can only be described as cloying. at first it's not bad, but over time it develops a sickly sweet familiarity to it. Sometimes when the cleaning cycle starts, you can get a strong odor of urine and or feces, usually when its run in the morning after sitting all night with urine in the bottom. Also, the pellets have no odor fighting capability at all, so when a cat defecates, you get the full smell until a cleaning cycle is run, which is a 10 minute wait in cat activation mode, and even longer in automatic mode.The boy views the CG as his personal spa. When I put it in cat activation mode, he discovered that by entering without doing anything would result in a fresh warm place to lie in. At the end of the cleaning cycle, the pellets are warm from the dryer, and its almost as good as laying in the sunny spot. As a result, he would repeatedly enter the CG to trip cat activation. This repeated running not only wastes solution, but also results in non stop noise and the CG not being available for the other cat when she needed it, resulting in problem peeing, either on our bed or on a pillow. Also, since the cleaning solution leaves the granules sticky, they would cling to the boy, and be carried all over the house. Others have wrote about the tracking problem, I got the jumbo version.Our girl has some behavioral problems stemming from being de-clawed, one of which is being temperamental about the litter box. One problem de-clawed cats have is that cat litter can be irritating to their paws, and apparently, the CatGenie's plastic pellet granules are not good for her. She did best on World's Best Cat Litter, which is made from corn husk, and is soft on the paws. As a result she was slow to adapt to it, and would find solutions to her problem outside the box.So, if you have a cat that is un-fazed by litter box changes, has good box habits, is not a litter flinger, and you can put this in a part of your house so that noise and odor issues would be tolerable, like a large bathroom or laundry room, then this may work well for you. My CG has functioned exactly like it should, no clogs or jams, it's just that my situation was not compatible with the CatGenie."
196688,2,"I ordered these for my cat as my dog seems to benefit from her kind...but hers are practically as big and she won't eat them whole. I tried quartering them with a pill splitter, but she spits them out as well. She gets sick on canned food, so I can't try crushing them in that for her. Will see if my daughters would like to try with their cats I guess."

20518,0,"This was inexpensive, especially compared to a lot of other carriers, and the body of it is sturdy. The door, though, is flimsy: the pins that you adjust to open or latch the door are just plastic (the knobby things you use to move the pins are even worse), and I worry that a stressed-out cat could snap them. My cat also likes to hide or snooze in the carrier, so he sometimes swats at the open door. If he breaks it, this will be an expensive hideout for him and a warning not to be cheap for me."
75620,2,"First of all, if you have carpeted floors, just close this page. This thing doesn't move on carpet.The sound that emits from this creepy device is shrill; it scares my cat.

90212,1,"this was a great find, i had been looking for some time. my boyfriends mother lost her bischon and wanted some kind urn. this has everything she wanted, she can put photos and the ashes in. it was large enough to accomidate a few other items inside as well. all around great product!"
58027,2,"So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out. So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually. Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy. I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope. She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope. I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle."

Other than that it's cool. No frills.
132099,1,"Assembling this cage was very easy. Did it by myself in under an hour. It is even more sturdy than I had expected. The cage is larger than what one expects from looking at the picture. And the tubular frame gives this cage the strength of Fort Knox. :-)My single male ferret baby had been in a 24x18x22 folding dog crate. When I first put him in his Ferret Nation cage he war danced for 10 minutes straight! Then he spent the next 1.30 hours running and climbing until he at last conked out in his hammock. He now has an older cage mate and they both are very happy in their roomy cage.On to the practical aspects of this cage; Neither of my boys can walk down the steep ladder. Both walked down the first half and then fell off. So the larger boy simply jumps off of the shelf to get down and the younger boy uses the hammock to climb down. For that reason I have the bottom of the cage covered with a piece of carpet cut to fit the tray, and a large towel bunched up for padding and tunneling underneath. The full width front doors make cleaning this cage extremely easy. It also makes it easy to attach crocks, bedding, hammocks and litter boxes. The storage shelf was an unexpected convenience. I keep their litter and scoop in a large plastic container and their food and treats in a second container and there is still room for their carrier. Very roomy!. This cage is worth every penny!In the future I plan on getting a female ferret and the FN #143 add-on. And I will be buying from Amazon as they definitely have the best price."

I use a stretchy large rubber band from a exercise kit and it works well for her back end problem,but it is wearing out and I need to find another one. This product is good for dogs that need to be helped from the front end or chest area. It also did not fit her right. I even tried to reverse it and fit it on her backend, but it did not work. She can get her front legs up on the step, but needs help with her rear legs."
168511,1,"I've been using this product for two weeks now. Main objective was keeping my cat off the kitchen table. This was pretty hard, as she is quite fearless and was used to having her way anywhere in the house. The table is now totally cat free. I also used it to keep her away from a specific room by placing it at the door; she now barely comes near it. Purchased two more which are on their way to me.Btw, Aluminium foil does a pretty good job as well keeping her off the kitchen counter."
122673,0,"I debated back and forth about whether or not to buy a cheap, generic, silver clamp lamp for half the price or this one. I decided on this one mostly because I liked the black color and how it would blend a little better versus stick out like the silver one. Overall I'm okay with my purchase, except for the actual clamp part, which is the main reason why I was purchasing this lamp. I wanted to be able to secure the lamp onto my hedgehog's cage one, because I have a cat who occasionally decides she wants to try to get on top (my main concern would be the expensive CHE bulb breaking if she knocked it off) and two because I remove the top of the cage in order to clean and didn't want the lamp to slid off or have to take it off every day.The swivel part of the clamp is very confusing to put together. There are no pictures, just written instructions which are not easy to follow. It even took my engineer boyfriend a bit to finally conclude how it was suppose to go. The final results are not very secure feeling. It's holding so far but it still makes me a little nervous. For the price, I would expect something a bit more secure. Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to make it with some sort of pin instead, but who am I.I'm currently using it with a 60 watt bulb, but will be switching to a 100 watt bulb as soon as it arrives. The lamp is barely warm to the touch, and I'll update after some use of the 100 watt bulb.Overall, it was an okay purchase, but I would think twice about forking over twice the amount of money again on this lamp."
73794,0,Length:: 0:33 MinsI wanted to get my dog a sturdy handsome leather collar. This one seemed to fit the bill but I was concerned because of the variety of reviews. The collar itself does seem sturdy and I believe it will hold up well. I am a little disappointed in the fact that the embossing detail doesn't seem to extend throughout the collar. I believe this is a quality control issue. The stamped detail fades after the eyeholes. I will post a video review just to help others considering this purchase. I don't believe it is worth going through the hassle of returning at this point so I am going to keep it. Possibly an ok purchase but does not merit more than 3 stars due to this issue.As for the reports of cheap leather I am no expert but it seems ok. It is just unfinished on one side. I will include visuals in my video review as well.
142423,0,The forks are not long enough to reach the pan and get the waste. It always leaves some on the bottom no matter what litter I use. Also the litter scope needs to have a flat edge because it don't get all the way to edge off the litter pan to get anything that is stuck.
110817,0,"I thought this was great, my dog is afraid of it. It's made of hard plastic and my wimpy dog was afraid of it as soon as it turned over once against the floor. I've tried wrapping it with rubber bands to soften the roll but too little too late!Update... my dog's older brother loves it! He's a little bigger and is a total food whore so I thought he'd like it. He's just visiting but I'm sending it home with him and I think it's finally gonna get some great use!"
28450,2,The impression I got was that you were buying 3 dinos for $ 8.75. Received only one....not such a good deal now. Last time I will order from them. Rip off!
140528,0,"If you just want a little kennel, this is a good option. It seems a bit flimsy and it is not big enough for big animals. Otherwise is good to transport little animals. More than enough for my little cat."
185154,1,My very old cat took to the warmer immediately. She now spends most of the day on it (even when it's not on). Once in a while the younger cat gets a turn.
150019,0,This turned out to be completely opposite of what I thought. It is a nice dog costume but the dogs have to wear it in the front not on their backs and its very hard to keep on a hyper dog!
7809,1,"I have used this dander reducing serum for almst 13 years now with over half a dozen cats with no ill effects. I had a moderate to severe cat allergy when I started using this, and it has allowed me to be around my cats without suffering. I do also regularly brush my cats, use an OTC allergy pill, and have a vacuum with a HEPA filter, but I think the shampoo really helps. I also stretch it out by wetting a washcloth with warm water before adding the serum. I have had friends over with cat allergies who aren't regularly exposed, and they're fine being around my cats. My cat allergy is now only mild, but I still use the shampoo, just a little less often than I did before. I brush or comb my cats out when they're done before I let them go, and they always smell so nice after they've been done. It does an excellent job at reducing dander and pulling off some of the loose hair."
158771,1,"This item was shipped really quickly which was great because my dog had chewed up her other collar that is similar to the gentle leader. I have used this collar before and it worked wonders for the dogs that pull because it turns their head to the side so that they are unable to pull you. However, I now have a 2 1/2 year old border collie mix and it is not working as well as it has in the past with my other dogs. I think that i just need to keep working on the training with this pup as she is a little to smart. Normally, I would highly recommend this collar and it will prevent the dog from having enough power to pull you really hard but I have learned that it is not as effective with all dogs."
45775,1,"This collar is absolutely fantastic! As long as you follow the instructions, fitting the collar was relatively easy. After one walk, my dog is hardly pulling at all! She now walks on a loose leash. I will be interested to see how she does when I walk her with my other dog. She is still pawing at the collar a little, but I have a feeling this behavior will disappear once she gets used to it. This is a fantastic collar that wasn't very expensive at all."
146143,0,"This was a really great deal for how much i paid... basically one grooming covered the initial purchase price.however, there is a few things i didn't like about it:1. the DVD is very very old and hard to follow2. the interchangeable clippers are flimsy3. the clippers do not run smoothly and sometimes makes a popping noise that scares my dog.4. my scissor handles broke the first time i used thembesides that, everything else was very nice. it comes in a neat bag for easy storage and i can't complain for the price"
92914,0,"UPDATE: I suggest the ""Martingale"" collar withOUT the chain. Rather get the all fabric model. The chain is so heavy it constantly slides down (gravity) and puts the collar in an improper and unsafe position around my dogs neck.ALSO: TRIPLE CHECK SIZEPREFERENCE: I Got a RED (all fabric, no chain) one and it's not only great, but EVERYONE loves the way the RED accents and looks so good on my Blue Nose American Pit Bull Terrier.-----------------------------------------------------------Good sturdy quality. Got large, which is just a bit too large after adjusting it to the smallest setting.Also, the chain portion is so heavy, that when there is no tension on the leash, the mental slides down and into the wrong position, making the effectiveness much less, and constantly readjusting it around back to the top of my dogs neck.Also, the metal makes a lot of noise when shaking at a normal walking pace, or when my dog shakes his head.See: STARMARK COLLARS. Blue Plastic Pinch collar - is the greatest collar I've ever used."
61749,2,"I received the package, but when I went to use the product one of the six applications had leaked all of the medication. I paid for six and in effect received 5 treatments."
151883,2,"I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment. Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged."
11326,0,"StarMark Every Flavor Treats / B0009YF43UMy puppy is in treat training, so we have plenty of different treats on hand. I slice them thinly for training, so that he doesn't get too satiated in training and so that his weight won't become unhealthy. I really didn't need any new treats for training, and certainly not these treats that work out to almost a dollar an ounce! But we recently bought the Everlasting Fun Treat Ball and found out, after it arrived, that our regular treats would not fit in the new ball. These treats were recommended for filling the ball. I hate to throw good money after bad, but I thought maybe these would be a fun enough diversion that it would be a worthwhile treat for the puppy, so I went ahead and bought some.The good news is that these treats do fit in the Everlasting Fun ball - almost as if the ball were made with these treats in mind! The treats slide in between the ""teeth"" of the ball opening easily, and the teeth don't catch at the treat (and my fingers) as they had in previous attempts to fill the ball. The treats are also very pretty, the different colors and flavors are neat for us humans to look at. The bad news is that the colors and flavors seem lost on my puppy, who much prefers his Omega ball, with its puppy kibble and occasional freeze-dried liver piece. He'll play with the Everlasting Fun treat ball and these treats if I give it directly to him, but when left to his own devices, he'll go back to his liver-laced kibble. I was expecting these treats to be exciting enough to hold his interest, but he seems kind of bored with them, and he seems to eat the treats more because they are there and less because they entice him - definitely not like the four or five other types of treats we use.This 5 oz. bag will fill our Everlasting Fun ball at least twice and maybe three times, but the ball is small enough that this isn't terribly impressive. Since he doesn't seem terribly interested in the treats, I'm thinking about slicing them up and adding them to his food, just to keep them from going to waste.~ Ana Mardoll"
175919,1,it turn out to be a very durable bed for puppy that loves to tear things up
18700,0,"When they say ""small"" in the title, they do mean small. Very small. The toy fits across the palm of my hand. I have large dogs, this is like a cat toy to them. It seems relatively sturdy, we'll have to see how it holds up. I gave it three stars because it is well-constructed, and you do get extra squeakers. But just note that this is a very, very small toy, so don't bother if you have anything larger than a Chihuahua."
152619,0,"I thought Theo was suppose to be a good aquarium heater. The reason I disagree with the reviews I read in the past is that the heater is unable to keep my aquarium at the temperature I'd like. No matter how low I set the dial, it still keeps my tank at 90 degrees.The overall form factor of it is quite nice. Easy to operate and set up. Because of those things, its not a total loss. I just wish it would turn off when the desired temperature has been reached.And for those out there who are wanting to ask: I have a 10 gallon tank (even though that doesn't matter. I should be able to get a 200 watt heater and have it work since it should just shut itself off when it gets to temperature). I have tried unplugging it and plugging it in, but that doesn't work. And it hasn't been taken out of the tank without first being turned off (even though it is able to cope with this)."
18624,0,"This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above, and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium,' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be). I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not, as I'd hoped, as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight). The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger, and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him. Oh well."
136836,1,"This product was recommended to me by a family member. My dog is a mini doberman mixed and he had a shedding problem that was driving my family CRAZY!! His hair was literally everywhere....in places you wouldn't even think it could be....floors, refrigerator, bathroom, blankets, stove...I mean everywhere!We started giving him this product and within DAYS we noticed a change. He's been on it now for a few months and there is hardly any hair in my apartment! It is absolutely incredible how much this product has reduced his shedding. Every vet I went to said there is sadly no cure for a dog's shedding.....well, he was mistaken. THERE IS A CURE! AND THIS PRODUCT IS IT!!Definitely recommend this!!!"
127693,0,"I know everyone is talking about how they got this for their big dogs but I bought this for my FOUR pound Maltese. My puppy loves toys bigger than her and loves to play. She plays REALLY REALLY HARD and she's BY FAR the smartest dog I have ever seen so I figured she'd love this toy. Of course she did. The problem was the quality of the Squirrels. She got this toy on Christmas Day and she had the ear off and the back seams torn out of one of the Squirrels...but she loves that one eared Squirrel and takes it with her everywhere. Good thing they make refills for the Squirrels. She doesn't really like the Tree Trunk but I think it's because she hasn't played around with it much yet. (She got a ton of toys for Christmas and is still exploring them all).I would recommend this product. However, I would just suggest you buy extra Squirrels right away."
71994,2,"I tried the Contech CAT001 CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent in my backyard for over a month. Cats walk directly in front of it, it detects them but has no effect on them at all."
27554,0,"This little chipmunk is very hard for my 7lb pup to do any damage too, except for the tail. The hair-like fabric that it's made out of is easily plucked out of the animal. I've noticed my dog walking around with the fibers stuck to his mouth. Overall though, these Kong Material products are great!"
186048,1,After using this for the first time on my dachshund that suffers from skin irritation in the summer heat I noticed an immediate improvement. Used it twice now and the second time seemed to be an even better response. Visible difference in skin condition.
28400,1,We have three dobermans and a bulldog and this is great. The raised bumps must feel so good bc I won't even attempt to take it away. I highly recommend this product for chewers. You could get a a little blood from the gums but the dogs love it.
11224,0,"This little light does work, but not consistently. The light flickers in strength and sometimes won't come on at all. I can get it to work, and it did the job, but I wouldn't recommend it as a reliable option."
164540,1,I have used this several times for cat urine. My cat peed on our cushy ottoman because she had a urinary track infection and was trying to tell us. I deep cleaned the ottoman with our Bissell Shampooer then poured this Cat Odor Off all over that area. It must dry completely. I could not smell any sign of cat urine after that. It's been four years since the accident and I still cannot see or smell any sign of cat urine on the ottoman. This stuff worked great!Also our cat missed the litter box and got it on the concrete floor. I wiped up the urine and poured the cat odor off on the area and it killed the urine smell.Cat Odor Off also has a pleasant smell. I originally bought this at our local veterinarian. I would recommend this product!
157123,2,"I just noticed that in the picture the treats look pink, but the ones I got they were black.Anyway, I thought this would be a good treat for my friend's old cat since they were soft. I wanted to test them out with my cats first to see if they would like them. I have four cats and neither of them would eat it, they would smell it and that's it. It was pretty obvious they didn't like them, and they have eaten other cat treats before. I then tried my friend's cat, he also wouldn't eat them."
100623,1,"For the most part I like this bed. It is quite heavy once it is filled with water and hard to move. I still can't believe how much water it took to fill, and it took a little doing to get most of the air out of the bed once it wss filled. Other than that I am satisfied with it. The lining seems quite durable. It took a while to get my dog to lie on the bed, but once he got used to it he started laying on it on his own. He seems to like it, and I did notice that his belly was much cooler. I am thinking of getting another one for my other dog. The real trick is getting them to lay on the bed without being afraid of something new and different. I am sure it probably works better for short haired dogs, which I have, than those with longer hair, but it does seem to work.I wish I had something similar for my bed."
87594,1,"This purchase was to replace a previous collar of exactly the same make and model. Although it had received several years of vigorous, continuous use, it was still in very good shape. Only problem was, the dog's neck grew and he needed a longer collar. So, since the last one held up so well, we knew its new replacement had to be one of the same quality.Delivery was speedy and well packaged, as is typical with Amazon purchases."
47936,1,"We are proud parrot owners and recently aquired a new baby parrot. Our older parrrot rides on top and the new baby rides inside. It comes complete with a rain cover and (faux) sheepskin pad on the inside. Easy assembly. Plenty of room on the bottom for your shopping purchases and/or ""moms"" purse. 2 drink holders on the handle as well as a small compartment with a lid between the holders. We love it! You can view your baby (from the top side) while you're pushing the stroller. Locking back wheels and lightweight too. 5 stars. Only minor complaint I have is that when the zipper is closed, theres a small gap between where the zipper ends and the fabric begins. Our older parrot thinks this is an escape hatch. We solve this by stuffing a baby blanket in the 2 side gaps. I would recommend this stroller to anyone. If you buy this for a parrot, just keep a close eye out because they think the zipper (when left unzipped) is delicous. LOL (Thus the need for this new stroller.) Our last one was from Amazon too and this is a wonderful upgrade and much nicer stroller for the same price!"
206985,1,great addition to a critter trail cage but you will need to be creative with where to attach it unless you buy additional connections
34795,1,"I brush my cat's teeth every day using this set. I never had to use the finger brush, my cat just got used to the brush pretty quickly. He seems to like the taste of the toothpaste (right after I brush, he licks up the excess toothpaste around his mouth). I like the style of this toothbrush a lot better than the toothbrush that this set used to come with."
24175,0,"Just for the record. These are NOT Nylabones. They are meant to be eaten and with a large dog, it was toast within minutes. I was thinking that it was a bacon flavored NYLABONE that would last a long time. Had I looked closer, I would have known and saved a BUNCH of money."
31507,0,"I have four cats. I tried this product because of my 2 year old female that is skiddish and began urinating in one corner of the main family room where we spend most of our time. I was also hoping that it would help my 11 year old cat get along better with the three younger cats we adopted 2 years ago. After two months, I can say that I have noticed absolutely NO improvement as far as the cats getting along. There has been improvement with the urinating, but I am also using the Feliway spray on that corner daily. The spray is the Feliway brand, not the Farnum Comfort Zone like the diffuser is. I think the spray is the reason for the improvement in the urination problem. The diffuser is expensive enough that I will not continue to use it, given the limited results. Another major issue I have with the diffuser is that it only lasted 2 1/2 weeks for me! The second month, I unplugged it every night and plugged it back in the next morning so I could extend its life to one month. I put my cats in the basement during night time, so this was a good fix for me, but what a pain to remember to do that every evening and morning!For anyone experiencing cat problems I think this product is worth a try, and if it doesn't work then maybe do as someone else suggested and try a different brand before throwing in the towel completely. I will continue using the spray for the corner of the room where the urination problem was occurring."
76044,2,"I bought the medium for my 14 lb dacshund. The package arrived pretty quickly, however as soon as I took it out of the package, I saw just how cheaply made it was. The mustard piece is not actually attached to a strip of fabric the way it is shown in the picture. Instead, it is loosely sewn to the Velcro strips and one end of the mustard strip had already come off so it was flopping around. The Velcro strips are very narrow and will not hold up if there is any slight pull on them. A waste of $8.Side comment- the package lists a bunch of dog breeds that this is meant for and doesn't even state the obvious one which would be a dacshund!"
100559,0,"Our dog would not rest on it. Even though the temp was high and she is a big lab, she bypassed it for whatever reason. She didn't say."
43015,0,"These are tablets not much bigger than an ibuprofen tablet. You get 150 tablets for the cost. I also purchased Breath-eze Breath & Gas Relief Mints. They are the same color/odor as this product but much larger, about the size of three stacked quarters. I've actually seen my dogs eventually chew those up out of boredom, and we are two for two on these NaturVet tablets - I kept putting it in my Maltese's mouth and even tried holding his mouth shut and stroking his throat like I've seen done to make an animal swallow a pill...no go. He spit it out repeatedly. I am not sure it would do much good for breath if he won't chew it up, but might help with his ""occasional gas"" - if I could get him to swallow it. Maybe I'll try putting them in with the food, but our other dog the Lhasa Apso will probably eat them all. They are both most interested in what the other one has, but she is the worst about it. So if your dog is not too picky, I'm sure these would do the job."
123681,1,"This filter is fine for the mid-sized aquarium. It is excellent for both particulate removal and for phosphate reduction. Know the necessary clearance measurements for both inside and outside the aquarium before buying. You will need to know the clearance necessary between the wall and the aquarium as well as how much room you will need inside the aquarium to be sure the aquarium can accomodate this filter. Given the proper installation, I recommend this filter for its excellent results."
171797,1,"very nice leather dog collar ,for the price you cant beat it ,looks real good on dog ,well made, not to stiff"
130525,0,"These filter packets seem ok.They are a great filter system, and filter out almost anything,But at the same time, after being in for about 2 months, they start to sag dramaticly, almost to a manner, wherethey would leach fibres into the tank.. and when they sag, they also sag, to where there will be like a hole in themiddle, to where they dont filter barely at all!If you are like me, and change the packets only every 2-3 months, then i wouldent even buy these types of packets.They are still good filter media though!"
57171,0,"I am sorry to say that this is the first time in a long time that I have used Frontline and my cats came home with fleas. Usually I use advantage,but thought I would change. I have heard from others that the fleas have become accustomed to this product since it has been available for many years. I don't know for sure, but I switched back to advantage."
69653,2,"I purchased this product after reading mixed reviews, Let me tell you that it should be illegal to sell this scam. I have 4 dogs of several breeds and this product never seems to affect them at all. Yes I keep fresh batteries in it but thats not the problem. This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon."
176799,1,"I feed sweet potato treats to my little dog, due to his many food allergies.The sweet potato also provides some fiber to his diet. Lucky for him (& me)that he LOVES sweet potato.

2939,2,These pads are not the best made and sometimes the cotton pad is not even covering the bottom plastic liner. I have also experienced the pads leaking under and onto the wood floor-yuck!

180983,0,"The cage is lovely when put together. I would not use the word sturdy to describe the finished product (no instructions, bent metal pieces and a tray with holes in it from shipping unprotected next to the wires of the cage.) Nothing fits exactly but you can tighten things up with needle nose pliers and use wire to hold top corners that do not meet. It may do, though, it may do. It does look lovely. Not much support from the company that makes them. I was going to send it back but because they took so long in responding and the response was as clear as the (non)instructions I decided to go ahead and fix the metal legs so they could attach and tape the broken tray with holes. I bought hardwood dowels to make additional perches and do not expect the bird to use the open top. The lower shelf for storage will not hold heavy items, it is fine for newspaper lining and maybe a small container of food."
113930,0,"This product was really thin and does not give enough cushion for the dogs. They still like it but it's because they are not picky ;) hehe but I was disapointed on how thin it was, as they are outside dogs and this was suppose to keep them warm in the garage. I bought 3 and had to put towels on top on them to make it have more cushion. :/ Maybe on carpet it can be okay though."

32805,0,"This unit really requires the reservoir add on, without it you'll be refilling it every few days (I have 2 cats). Also it doesn't quite keep the water flowing enough in the pan to keep sediment and hairs from settling at the bottom.

61432,2,"While this product's rake uses metal tongs, the axles and wheels which guide it down tracks on either end are made of plastic. As a consequence, the wheels snap off the rake and you have yourself a very expensive standard scoop-it-yourself cat box.I suffered this same failure twice within a year or so of purchase and had to scold customer support before they'd send a warranty replacement the first time around -- They tried to blame their product's failure on my being overseas and seemed unimpressed with the fact that the power supply continued to work just fine, thank you.This was the second Littermaid automatic cat box I purchased (two separate models), and the first failed during the warranty period as well. In my defense, I thought the ""upgrade"" to the ""Elite Mega"" meant less of a chance of premature failure.Needless to say, this last Littermaid purchase was really my LAST Littermaid purchase.Caveat emptor."
77633,1,"We just got a 7 week old mini doxie puppy and bought this crate both as a housebreaking tool and a ""bedroom"". The fact that it has a divider screen makes it perfect for both. You can make the crate smaller for a young puppy to discourage eliminating in the cage and yet you don't need to buy a new crate when he is full grown. You just take the divider out. It is a very sturdy pen for the money, yet portable because it folds flat. I know I sound like an ad but I am just saying that all the things the company says about it are true."

142984,0,"We have four cats, and all use this box. That means I've had to overcome the problems previously mentioned. Here's what I do. I spray the clean base and comb with WD-40 FIRST, then gently wipe excess with paper towel and let the thing dry so cats don't get it on their paws. Later, when the base becomes stuck again with ...um..debris, I swap out the now dirty base with the old but clean one, respray both base and comb and take the nasty tray outside to hose down. I experimented around to find litter that would not stick or stink. Fresh Step (scoopable) seemed best on many counts.I also reuse those plastic binss four or five times, and even from the beginning, I sprinkle baking soda in them. Keeps the odors at bay. Because those deodorizer packets don't work (and do not stay on the lid as advertised), the baking soda works better at keeping odors down anyway.Finally, to keep the cheesy plastic, disposable lid where it's supposed to be, I use strong tape (package or Duct tape) on the bottom and top edge of the lid.This box is better than the old daily scoop boxes, and we continue to use the Litter Maid, but I am still giving this gizmo only three stars because the buyer should not have to do all this to make the product work in the first place. C'mon, Litter Maid!Marcia Carter"

I couldn't have the cat inside because I had a family member staying with me for a bit that was allergic to cats.So I bought this to keep the cat out of her yard.It had no effect what so ever. In fact the cat followed me around as I sprayed it.She smelled it and it was like nothing.

I do not think any pet over 15lbs would even be able to be pushed into this...QUALITYThe straps and materials seem flimsy and cheap in comparison to the black Sherpa Ultimate I have in large... this is about the size of a medium in that... and the zippers stick, the opening on the top would only allow a hand to fit through, there is NO WAY a reluctant cat would be loaded that way.I think the better way to go is a medium Sherpa Ultimate."

Which is easy but I thought it would go longer between fillings. The filter also leaves charcoal dust in the water. Apparently this is normal and not harmful but it does seem yucky. Also be warned it makes a lot of noise, not pump noise but waterfall noise. For the first few weeks I always felt like the water was on in the sink. It makes less noise if you turn the flow up to high but you can hear it even when several rooms away. Also it is not for outdoor use!"

Also, it does contain perfume and produces enough dust to be an irritant when I'm scooping it out.For more environmentally friendly and healthier alternatives that do control odor very well, I recommend SWheat Scoop litter or shredded paper (good use for junk mail) combined with a product such as Kitty's WonderBox Disposable Cat Litter Box."

On my cats, it basicly acts as a comb to get their hair in place. As far as removing all the loose shedding hair, I've been unimpressed. I don't know how well it will work to get knots or tangles out since none of my cats have really long hair, and they're all indoor cats.

I purchased the collar because I liked the idea of using the spray as opposed to the shock type collar.I received the collar and filled it with the spray and tested as outlined in the instructions that were supplied. After turning on the switch and placing it on our dog, it worked as advertised ... for a while. Even though I turned it off, it seemed to go through batteries at an amazing pace (3 in 3 weeks). As tip to those who have more success than I, buy them at Target in the electronics department. Check the cross reference on the Net for the correct battery type as they are not the most common variety.

32250,2,"So very disappointed in this item. Didnt even last an hour.We recieved this item at around 6:30 pm when UPS dropped it off.Very simple, add water, plug in and there you go.My pomeranian loves poured water so loved drinking from this for as long as it lasted anyway.Within an hour of plugging it in it began making horrendous noises. I unplugged it for the nightand plugged it back in this morning. The water wouldnt flow. Unplugged and plugged itin again, and it did start to flow but became extemely noisy again. Also, it seemed asthough the water wasnt lasting very long.Thats when I noticed that the mat it was sitting on was soaked. Needless to say that less than24 hours later it is repackaged and at the Post Office to be returned.What a disappointment for us, My pup was so happy with it for the few minutes he was able to use it.Great Concept but terrible product."

18024,0,For starters the price was fantastic especially compared to the same product in Oz which was $275 and the effectiveness was immediate however I only used the collar very occasionally and accordingly to a psychologist friend this is the best way to use such a method - use it too much and the dog ignores the correction - intermittant is better. The best way to apply a correction is in the moment and that is not always possible. I have spent a lot of money on trainers before I discovered this collar but I do stress the occasional use - more than a few minutes and you create another adverse reaction.
108609,2,"Cats are way smarter than the mat. You need the whole floor covered with scatmats to have any chance at all of keeping them out of a room. They will either jump over one or two wide, or run across three or more. As soon as I bought multiple mats, the power supply was constantly activating itself. Soon after it died. It was replaced at no charge. Unfortunately, the replacement is doing the same thing. I'm boxing the whole mess up and sending it back.

152364,0,"I have been using the Simple Solution Coverups for our aging dog and then noticed they sold a diaper. After reading the reviews I decided to give to purchase one, thinking they would be more absorbent. It really isn't worth the extra money to me. You can buy almost two coverups for the price of one diaper. You still need to put in a pad of some sort into both the coverups and the diapers. Otherwise neither would hold the urine. (I use adult Poise pads which work well.) My other disappointment was the color. The color displayed is a teal blue. I received a denim diaper. The fabric is very stiff and just doesn't look that nice. It will serve its purpose, but this is the first and last ""diaper"" I will buy. I will go back to the Simple Solution Coverups."

Living here in Florida, from about June to November we experience a hurricane season, in which at any point in time, we may be faced with a hurricane that could require evacuation from our home. I have 3 male rats and 4 females who are housed in two very large cages. In the event of a hurricane evacuation, there is no way I would be able to bring their cages with us, as I also have 2 small dogs, 2 cats, 2 guinea pigs, 2 kids, and my husband and myself...but only one car. These Super Pet My First Home for Pet Rats are the perfect size to put my rats in if I should have to leave my home. The cages, while too small to be full time housing, are big enough to fit my rats (the boys in one, the girls in another)while we travel to a safer area- but are small enough to not take up too much space in my car. I use mine to hold my rats during cage cleaning time as well. I have had mine for over a year and have not had any problems with them. They are safe and my rats have not found any way to escape them.For more on my rats or rat care in general, visit my blog at http://ratwhisperer.blogspot.com"
211264,1,"I bought these steps for my Yorkie to get on and off the bed. The steps are well made and they look nicer than the picture. They come with ""anti-skid"" pads, but if you have hardwood floors, the steps will slide all over the place and scare your dog out of using them. My solution was to cut small pieces of velcro and attach them to the bottom instead, and then velcro the steps to the floor. I mean, we can't have sliding steps! It works great and she's gotten used to the stairs now. (And believe it or not, if you have to move it for any reason, the velcro WILL come off of the floor without damaging the wood. You'll just probably have to cut more in order for it to stick again.)"

93622,2,"I picked up some of this mix last summer at a local agricultural center. It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right. My first outing with it last summer was a total bust. I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees. If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back. Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it. At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated). It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you. But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on. I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing. (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands). I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon. Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth. I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me. I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care. I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it. In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers. Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc. My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it. It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack"

They still pull and tug, perhaps slightly less aggressively than they used to (I think I'm being generous here), but in any case, they still pull.On the plus side - they are perfectly usable collars and well priced. I leave the collars on full-time. The instructions say to remove the collars by snapping open the links (very difficult!), rather than pull the collar over the dog's head. I just leave it on. The dogs don't seem the slightest bit bothered by it."

145364,2,"My two parakeets loved hollowing out this toy. Then I looked into the hole they had created and noticed that the wire that holds the toy extends almost to the center on either end. As the birds hollowed out the toy, they expose the wire.Although the wire is thin, it is consistently jabbing the birds the entire time they are tunneling to the ends. I cut the wire on the end I could reach, and tried to push the wire against the end that I couldn't get the scissors into. This is really a pretty sadistic toy. On the one had the birds absolutely love to hollow it out, but as they do they are tortured by the wire jabbing them the whole time. The ads for the toy claim the log is held by sisal, but sisal probably didn't work because the bird would chew it and the toy would fall. They substituted wires, but now the birds are being jabbed by the wires. I hope the manufacturer really cares enough about birds to do something about this toy.Until they do, I would not buy it."
179101,0,"I'm really not sure what to think of this product. I have been using it as directed, trying to potty train my cat, for two months. My cat was just over a year old at the beginning of the process. Before using the product, I had already gotten him used to using his old litter box on top of the toilet.During the first stage, he urinated in it with no issues, but he pooped on the floor several times before finally deciding to poop in the litter pan. I left things as they were for about a week and a half, and then punched out the smallest hole. Again, he had no issues with urinating, but he pooped on the floor several times before deciding to go in the litter pan. Then, after a few times going in the litter pan, he went back to pooping on the floor.My husband and I decided he must not have been ready for the next step, so we used the second tray to go back a step, with no holes punched out. And yet now my cat has gotten into this habit of pooping on the floor, and he continues to poop on the floor about 3 out of 4 times. After a week of this, I moved the litter pan to the floor, to see if that would help, and he started using it slightly more often, but he still pooped on the floor about 2 out of 3 times.We have not been scolding him for pooping on the floor, but we have give praising him enthusiastically every time he poops in the litter pan. I give him a kitty treat and a little bit of canned food every time he poops in the thing like he's supposed to, but I give him nothing if he poops on the floor. Yet he still just doesn't get it or refuses to cooperate.I feel like he should be able to learn, if I'm just stubborn enough, but it doesn't seem like it's happening! I'm about to give up! Finally, after a couple weeks, I moved the litter pan back up on to the toilet, just to see what happens... But I don't know what else to do.The product is sturdy and has no problem holding my cat, but he doesn't seem to want to use it no matter what I do. I don't know if it is a problem with the product or with my cat!"

69729,1,"I have a 10 pound Mini Pin mix who is a total alpha female; 1 year old. She is a rescue dog and has some anxiety issues which arise when I leave the house. My roommates informed me that she barks loudly intermittently throughout the day when she is in her crate. She has come a long way with her anxiety issues, but this was one I was having a hard time getting passed with her. I tried proper crate training...etc. I bought the citronella collar and tried it and dismissed it right away. First, it freaked her out and she would not stop shaking for the rest of the evening. The smell also stayed on her coat so I had to give her a bath.Looking for another option I researched this product. I was a skeptic as it didn't have rave reviews for the most part. But, for the price and for my roommates sanity I gave it a go. Additionally, I wanted a product that I could use when I wasn't around and I didn't have to supervise with her.It has now been one week since I used it and I am AMAZED!!! I introduced it to her when I was home. I created a situation in which she would normally bark and left it on. When she barked it went off and she responded immediately! She looked at it with this expression - what was THAT?! She seemed to get it right away. After a week she has only barked one more time and immediately stopped when the noise went off. She is not scared of the noise and it makes for a less anxious dog. Instead of having to deal with an anxious dog when I get home that is jumping up and down she is calm and peaceful. When she begins to get anxious and gives a yelp the sound goes off and distracts her/stops her from escalating and she calms down.I decided to bring it with me on her walk today because I'm working on stopping her from getting aggressive around larger dogs and trying to run after bicycles. When I saw that she was beginning to think about doing either of those things I pressed the button, the sound went off, and she snapped out of it understanding that I didn't want her to do what she was about to do. They also sell hand held items like this and it made up my mind to buy one for walks and other training.I don't know how long it will work - hopefully this solves the problem long term. I will update again in an a few months. But, if you are on the fence about this - buy it. It's not going to break the bank and is a humane way to help train your dog. And in the case of my dog - it was immediate. I don't have to supervise her with it when I go to work. I am now a much less stressed out dog owner knowing she isn't stressing out when I leave."

152523,0,"I installed mine over a 3/4 acre lot with an additional spool of wire. Installation was time consuming but not too difficult. I attempted to follow the instructions about training the dog by listening for the tone and pulling the dog back into the yard, etc. The only problem was I could not hear the tone at all. My hearing isn't what it used to be so I went to get the teenage kids. They could barely hear the tone when it was turned all the way up. We finally had to train our dog by turning the collar over and watching for the red light. It definitely made the training more difficult and resulted in our dog getting shocked a few more times than would have been ideal.Our dog can be stubborn and after a week or two, she decided to bolt in the front yard. Up to this point, we had the unit on the lowest shock setting. After that we turned up the shock to the second level and she got a surprise when she tried it again. She no longer is interested in trying to run so I must admit that the upper level will alert even stubborn dogs. She is now staying in the yard safely.It seems a small thing to put a louder or more audible speaker in this. There are ways around training but it definitely makes it harder. I do like the low profile of the collar which is why I selected this unit."

Sure enough, after a couple of days she figured out how to push the feeder forward to get the rest of the food. My solution, I put her evening meal in the already exposed hopper, I put her morning meal three hoppers back and then schedule the hopper to move forward 3 times come morning feeding time. My cat doesn't try to move the hopper forward and it solves the problem of my cat getting her 5am feeding and not waking me up."

He's had it about a month and there is still a lot of filling inside he can't reach, and at the price, it just isn't worth it.

60726,2,"The item I was sent was not the same as the image advertised. Apparently this is a French or British version of the same product. I don't know if that is the case or not.

After receiving the item, I saw that the description did say this, but the seller should use the picture that matches the product."
112530,0,"I have come to learn from trainers that certain dogs are sound sensitive and others are not. My daughter's dog responded well to pennies in a empty soda can, by my collie did not. She didn't stop barking because of the Lentek Super Bark Free either.The product is nicely made, easy to set up and mechanically or electonically works as advertized. I put the thing in audible mode and it is responsive to the dog's barking and the sensitivety adjustment does work, and it is really annoying. Neither mode was effective with the collie.I would definately give it a try. You will find out very quickly if it stops your dog from barking or not. I have not returned the item so I can't comment on how cooperative the vendor is."
121689,0,"but lately we've gotten a number of batches that seem a bit off. One was very dusty and smelled off, a few seem like they've not been cured long enough.

Always excellent communication and delivery is always well in advance of what they anticipate."
135476,1,I somehow expected a soft foam-type base with a cover. It's a lightweight plastic frame that you snap together and then slip the cover over. The frame seems sturdy and the cover was easy to slip over it. My mom still hasn't been able to teach her dachshund how to use it but they'll get there! I looked at lots of other options at local pet stores that were much more expensive and heavy. I feel like I got my money's worth.
119604,1,"My male cat loves to kick litter and this hood has stopped the litter from going all over the room. Other hooded litter boxes were too short and he wouldn't use them because he couldn't kick enough. This one is nice and tall and he can see through it so he doesn't feel hemmed in. No more problems! I rarely have to clean up litter from around the box; the hood does a great job keeping all the litter in the box. Overall, we are very pleased with the litterbox. Very little odor, no more scooping, and a cartridge lasts around 24 days."
154853,1,"The cats came into our family through me, so I have the responsibility of cleaning the litter boxes, which is perfectly fine since he picks up the dog poop when we go for a walk. However, when my husband and I started talking about the future such as a possible pregnancy, I reminded him that he'd have to take care of the litter during that time. That's when we thought of the automatic litter box, and wow! Why didn't I get this sooner? It's awesome! It has reduced the smell in our house by a million. Yes, it's way more expensive than a regular box to keep up with, but honestly, it was expensive buying all those air fresheners too. It's a great product. The cats got used to it right away, and it appears to work just as it is designed. If you keep it on 20 minute clean-up, the rake won't get stuck...it only gets stuck when the crystals aren't dry enough. Overall, great buy. Only bad thing is the cost of up-keep."

132462,2,"Ok I saw the mixed feedback. Figured I would try it out and see for myself...to try and stop our 12 week old puppy from barking nonstop and to correct him from jumping up. I am sad to report it was a waste of money. I know our puppy hears it...he could care less. it doesn't even phase him, he looks at it and doesn't even stop what he is doing. He is a mix of lab and newfoundland...no idea if this matters. Anyhow the previous reviewers that said they can hear it when put up to their ear are correct. you can hear a faint sound. Needless to say, I wouldn't waste your money on this. I am amazed that anyone else is having any luck with this because our puppy isn't even affected by it in the least. My husband said this would be a waste of money and sadly he was right."

I have even tried a greenie pill pocket but, as soon as she bit into the pill pocket, that was it. If anyone else has any other ideas please let me know.I have found out since my last review that if you give your cat or dog some moist can food before administering the pill, that it goes down much easier as their throat is already moist & slippery to help with the pill going down the throat"
36279,2,My dog and probably cat were attacked by hartz products. I have given my dog the 3in1 probably 6 times in her life time.

She was stabilized but it took a month to get her back into some semblance of health. Go to Hartzvictims.org and read all about unsuspecting families inadvertently poisoning their beloved pets.

210671,0,"I purchased this item because I needed a way to allow my cats access to the house (for food, water, and safety), but to keep other animals (racoons) out.The door is relatively easy to install, provided you have the necessary tools (a jigsaw, a drill, and a screwdriver). However, the magnets that are supposed to open the latch to let the cats in are not very strong, so the cat can't always get in, even *if* you've managed to convince it that it's a good idea to try. The magnets basically have to be in a *very* precise location (margin of error is about 1 cm) in order to actually open the door.So, if you need to have a restricted entry system, I would seriously recommend going for a higher-quality product; this one is pretty medicore.p.s. the cat in the product photo is obviously not a full-size cat; the door flap is *barely* big enough to allow my cats in (and they're medium-sized; not overweight or a large breed)."
50567,1,"I am a professional pet groomer with over 35 years experience. JW gripsoft slicker brushes are the BEST on the market! When ordering them PAY ATTENTION, only JW brand come with regular pins AND/OR soft pins.

The manufacturer model number for JW Gripsoft small pet soft pin slicker is #65011 and the JW Gripsoft large pet soft pin slicker is #65002. Do not rely on the pictures but the original brushes have gray rubber under the soft pin brush and blue rubber under the regular pin brushes."
18753,0,"Well, I hope I can save someone some time and frustration writing this review. I had some initial problems starting this CO2 system. First, I couldn't get any co2 coming out. I read the directions and it said give it 24 hours for the mixture to start working. Well, I waited for over 48 hours, and nothing. After reading some forums on the internet, I found that you're not supposed to use tap water/chlorinated water, because it kills the yeast. So, I put some stress coat/dechlorinater in the mix, added some more yeast and woo hoo, started working. But then, I had it on a timer, and when the timer turned the pump back on, it didn't work again. Then after messing around for quite some time, I found that there's a design flaw with the pump. When the timer turns the pump off, the co2 forms an air bubble or co2 bubble around the propeller of the pump and slowly leaks out the back of the pump. But, when the timer turns the pump back on, the propeller can't suck any water through because the propeller is just spinning in the air pocket, so no water or co2 is jetted through the nozzle. There for, I'm not able to put it on a timer. But, I really don't think that it matters, cause from what I've read, it's pretty hard to put in a harmful amount of co2 with units like this or the Haggen Ladder systems. I see though that the poster before me had luck putting it on a timer and I wonder how they've gotten theirs to work. So far it's been running for a couple weeks, and for some reason my plants look more pale. Maybe there's some other issue I have to address yet to get my plants going better, but for now I thought I'd give this system 3 stars. Hope this helps someone. Good luck."
127200,0,"I bought this to attach to a ladder on my pontoon boat to assist my golden retriever onto the boat in waist deep water. He loves to jump in the lake chasing tennis balls and then go back on the boat. I thought this would be a good way for him to get back up vs me standing in the water and helping him up the ladder. I am not 100% happy with this item as it does not secure good and seems to float. I did buy extra velcro straps from Amazon to try to secure a lower bar better to my ladder and it helped some, but not much. When this is attached without what I added, it floats in the water and as waves hit the boat, this bounces up and down. My dog is more scared of it then and won't go near it. Even attaching the straps that are made onto this to secure the top of it aren't that great and take a lot of playing around with to secure it. It is the only item like this on the market so I am keeping it and will keep trying to make it work. If I would have seen this ahead of time, I probably would not have bought it."

79725,0,"I've had many interactive string type toys over the years and this one really is DA BEST!! I think it's the swivel clip attachment that makes this toy better than others. The feathers really swirl around as you flip the wand back and forth, resembling a real bird. I have 2 cats and they both love it so much that they often crash into each other in mid-air while going after it. We have to be careful or they'll destroy the house as they leap up to 5 feet into the air... even our chubby cat jumps really high!As others have said, a peacock feather was NOT included even though it is mentioned in the title and there's a picture of one. But the toy is so great that I really don't care... I can pick up a peacock feather for .50 at the pet store.UPDATE 3/29/12: ****** WARNING ****** The wand of this toy is made of fiberglass and if the rubber tip falls off the exposed end can cause you to get tiny, invisible fiberglass splinters in your hand. I couldn't figure out how I kept getting these little ""needles"" in the palm of my hand until I finally realized one day it was coming from the end of the wand. I googled ""Da Bird"" and ""fiberglass splinters"" and found out that many others have had the same problem.Normally I would have just thrown the toy in the garbage but my cats are completely addicted to/in love with this thing... they sit next to it every night and cry at me to play with it. For now I have glued something on the end to protect my hand and it seems to have solved the problem. Make sure your cats don't chew on the wand though!See more comments about this problem here:http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JED9SSQD8P43/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg1?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=FxDIW1ZLAIYJXV&cdPage;=1&asin;=B000FWAP8A&store;=pet-supplies&cdThread;=Tx2AU6K8URWS3FV#wasThisHelpful"

If your dog has serious skin problems or a lot of chronic itching, you will definitely have to repeatedly use this product as it doesn't keep the itch away for long. My dog has skin allergies during the summer months and was itching nonstop, so I decided I needed to do something more. I ordered this shampoo and it did seem to work, for a few days. Its effects generally wore off long before the week was up, though. I still have to pair it with her regular dose of Benadryl to really help the itching stop. So it is a nice shampoo and the scent is great, but I wouldn't fully rely on it to help medicate your dog's itch."

I haven't tried the other one (I think it's called Sportmix) because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs. My dog has been eating one a day and I can't say for sure whether or not they work. She used to have really smell gas; she hasn't dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe it's due to the biscuits - who knows? She does like these biscuits very much, so I will surely buy them again."

I have since gotten myself more informed on the use of natural and effective ways to help prevent your pet (and home) from becoming a place habitable for fleas.It worked ok...still had to use an additional spray. I have a very sensitive-skinned mini-Schnauzer. ONE flea makes him miserable...much less a few. He has skin allergies in general, and changing his diet has been the biggest helper of all. Get yourself educated on what is in your commercial dry and soft pet foods, even the expensive ones...your eyes WILL be opened!!"

178119,0,"This has some good points. It is not perfect but the best so far and I always have my eye out for something better.The biggest flaw of this box is that in the lid there is a type of indentation that I believe is designed for litter liners. Since my cats have their claws I do not use litter liners. Every once in a while, when my cats pee, they scoot their rumps near the part of the lid that has the indentation and as a result, pee leaks out of the box and onto the litter mat. Nasty. I've put duct tape over the indentation which has helped quite a bit but sometimes the pee finds a way out anyway. Also, I don't know how my cats do it, but pee also ends up on the stairs and collects in a nice pool of pee at the bottom. Now I intentionally put a little litter on the stairs because of this.This box has helped reduce (not eliminate) the amount of litter that ends up on the floor and since the litter pan is to the side of the entrance, I like that I don't get a full view of the litter pan contents when I step into the bathroom.The escaping pee issue is the reason I gave this box 3 stars."

He's only about 35-40 pounds and takes up the entire thing even when he isn't all stretched out, so I wouldn't recommend the bed for a dog any larger than he is.

149609,0,"On my first visit to a new vet, she tells me that my cat has fleas (indoor cat, never had fleas in her entire three-year life). I was also skeptical because I am religious about her Frontline. Anyway, the vet said that topical treatments only keep a cat from getting fleas, my home was probably still infested. She suggested spraying my cat's bedding with a treatment, which is scary, since HER bedding is MY bedding, and most sprays are toxic! So, I set out this trap for 24 hours. And nothing. I hesitate to say it didn't work, though. I think the vet was defective not the flea trap! It makes a good nightlight, though, and it does catch gnats/mosquitoes! In conclusion, am I sorry I bought it? No. Does it work? I don't know!"

They have to stretch and bend to get to the food and they prefer my other traditional feeder more. That being said, it's nice because you can see the birds on it from any angle. Also, its one piece of plastic so it's nice and sturdy and it suctions solidly onto any glass. My cats have had a blast watching it since I positioned it right by their cat tree.

The only thing I've found that it doesn't work on is toner from a printer cartridge, but nothing works on that. I'd recommend it to everyone because it works and is safe and non-toxic, which anyone with a pet or small child can really appreciate. ******** It's over a year since I posted this and I still haven't found anything that even comes close. I've used it on everything and all types of fabric. There's never been a problem with color fastness or completely removing the odor/stain.

At the time, I was using a regular water bottle and a collapsable bowl for my dog (not the most efficient way to keep her hydrated). This bottle is a lot easier to tote around and works well. Although I figured the color was incidental, I have to admit being pleased at receiving a bright pink one."
142344,0,"The Good Stuff: My cats love this litter box. When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some ""left over"" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, ""re-setting"" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit."

142513,2,"We have from two to four cats at a time in our home, and managing the litter box is something we want to be as easy as possible. This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the ""only"" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it. We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one. This one went in the trash as we couldn't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it. A large waste of money.Not well recommended.I'll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat's desire to ever use the unit again :)"
93370,0,"The Sight N Sound ball is best suited for hard surfaces, because the sound and light is activated by movement (of the ball) and carpet inhibits motion. This toy interests my two cats but does not keep them occupied for long. The primary problem is that the ball isn't tactile, my cats can chase it but they are unable to grip or bite it, the only method of play is for it to roll around.I've had this toy for nearly two years and so far the batteries have not died nor has it broken - even after the countless smacks against baseboard. The ball always rolls around when I open the drawer containing all of our cat stuff and my younger cat does get excited by the noise it makes. However when I give him the ball to play with he loses interest as soon as it stops making noise. How popular this toy will be with your cat(s) will probably depend on the type of toys they enjoy interacting with."

Still, if you have a need for the black ""Extreme"" Kong, go for the larger sizes, as I just watched my male pit bull tear this into about 50 pieces in about an hour. My other pittie (girl) just sort of gnaws on things, so this size lasted two nights with her. Kongs are great for big chewers, though most DEFINITELY not indestructible. Still, this ""large"" size is just pretty worthless in my recent experience."

I give them their warning no, and give them one of their hunderd toys to chew on, when that feels me I pick them up say No and spray (I keep them away from the initial spray to protect their eyes) I would say 3 or less sprays and they stay away from that area effortlessly!

I put her food in her bowl and spinkle it on top, let her lick the spoon and she is instantly attracted and eats everything. She will actually lick the one spot where the powder is first, so I know she likes the taste. So happy with this product and she is to! No more multi trips to the box and sitting and doing little pee's. She is also more spunky and plays constantly with her sister. It is amazing and so glad that they found out this product has many useful remedies."

10694,1,"This stuff saved Wizard, the no-longeer-stray tom cat! A friend called and begged me to take in a giant stray tom that was super friendly despite having an abscessed foot due to fighting. He was immediately taken to the vet, treated and brought home. We couldn't get him in to be neutered for 4 days. Overnight he sprayed in the bedroom. My daughter was woken up by the smell. It permeated the house even though he was kept in just that one room. I have never smelled anything like that...ever! Skunk spray is more tolerable! I was sure we would never get it out and would have to take Wizard to the animal shelter. Tom cats are almost immediately put down so this would have been a tragedy. We kenneled Wizard at a local kennel until the neuter date and bought a bottle of Urine Gone. I soaked the room with half the bottle. I tipped up the mattresses and soaked them. Then we closed the door and waited. Twelve hours later the room smelled worse, not better! I was horrified. If this happens to you, do not give up! I soaked the room with the other half of the bottle, making sure to hit any spots in the room I missed, including halfway up the wall. This morning when I opened the door, I was shocked. No smell! I walked into the room, spun around in disbelief, sniffing like an idiot. Still no smell! I have read that cat urine will smell worse at first when using this product. That is definitely true to my experience. It has to be given at least 24 hours and everything must be saturated. I have hardwood floors and they haven't been damaged by the Urine Gone. I've also read that the smell comes back over time for some people. I don't know if thats due to the actual smell coming back or the cat continuing the behavior. Either way, I'm prepared to keep Urine Gone available at all times. I plan to pair it with plug-in cat pheremone diffusers. My vet swears by them. Give Urine Gone a try before giving up!"
91254,1,"Bought one years ago for one of our older dogs, he wouldn't use it. The springy effect bothered him. Once we acquired a new puppy we couldn't keep him off of it. This is a replacement since the other one is over 8 years old."

One of my cats recently had some problems with a UTI so, I ordered this Drinkwell Platinum. I decided to go with this one as this had a built-in reservoir. I wish I had ordered the original one. This one isn't bad, but, the bowl rim on this one seems to be lower than the original. Even if I don't fill the reservoir this one will splash out onto the floor surrounding the bowl. I have to keep a towel wrapped around the bottom to soak up the water. I turned down the flow to the lowest it would go, and it still splashes out. Though, other than that it's a good product."

120330,1,"I think I have figured out why there are a mix of opinions about the noise level. My guess is that there is a quality issue and some people get better working parts then others. Mine CAN actually be very quiet but it is short live, because most of the time it sounds like a loud buzzing, rubbing, or rattle. I tried to shave the fins on the part that spins with a razor thinking they may be rubbing against the sides, no luck. I've pulled out the tube and put it back in countless times. I pushed it down hard, pulled it out some, but there is no sweet spot on mine. I will add a video soon to show how noisy it runs. It also came shipped with a nice crack in the top cover right out of the box. I already trashed the box and shaved the fins with a razor, but I still may try to return it. This is way too loud. The filter does do a great job, but quiet it is not.EDIT (MOD FIX):OK, I figured out why this is so loud. The part that goes into the motor (fins attached to a magnet) is two connected pieces. However, this makes the spinning part with fans vibrate against the magnetic piece below it. So, I dried it and took a small piece of scotch tape and tightly wrapped it around the top of the magnet and the bottom of the fin. This made it act as one solid piece. I put it back in the motor and it is now super quiet. Problem solved for next to nothing."

196324,0,"I've had this tank for 8 months now. The tank itself is made nicely. It has little feet to keep it from scratching surfaces you set it on. The filter is not perfect, but sufficient. I've had to restart it multiple times because the motor tends to overheat and stop working. There's room for a heater, a vital object you're going to need to keep your fish alive. In order to feed the fish, you have to take the top off, but that isn't that bad. You can feed them through the top flap if you take care to miss the filter, or just lift the top off at the corner and put food in.The dangerous part about this tank is the light fixtures. There is no protection from it. In other words, there is no plastic barrier from the water to the lights. If you let the water level go down just a little bit (I like mine down because the waterfall from the filter oxygenates my plants), the water splashes up at the lights. My lights corrode very quickly. Sometimes, the light won't turn on and you have to scrape the corrosion off the lamp ends. I've had to replace the lamp twice in the past 8 months. If you aren't savvy with fishtanks, most lights only need changing once a year. It's especially dangerous if you are changing the bulb, because it's so damp and covered with water. There's even a warning up there in the canopy that says ""Wipe dry before changing."" It's very unsafe.Overall, this tank isn't bad. But the light fixtures were poorly done. If you are good with making things, try making a plastic barrier to separate the lamp from the water. Otherwise, use caution when taking off the top or changing the light bulb."
134450,0,"This is actually an excellent filter and I would have given it 5 stars. However, this is only the case when it's working, though it's only the biowheel that is faulty and outdated.The biowheel on these older models turns as water is ejected out of the filter. However, within a few days (maybe week and a half) the filter either starts to slow down or the wheel gets stuck against the cover because it stops turning.If you bought this item you probably bought it for the mechanical, chemical, and bio filtration it supposedly offers. However, about half of the time you'll end up with just chemical and mechanical, as the bio filtration ceases when the wheel stops to function.Still, the filter itself is an awesome piece of machinery and it is otherwise well built. Aside from the bio filtration, every other method of filtration works just great (though the filter pads could come with a bit more carbon).I've had my 30 gallon aquarium for 3 years now and the Penguin 150 has been with me since day one. During the middle of my second year with it I bought an Emperor 280 (also by marineland) to work along with the Penguin 150. I believe the Emperor models is what the Penguin was supposed to have accomplished, except the Emperor models are a lot better. The wheel does not rely on the flow of the water being ejected from the filter and instead has a hose like tube spraying water on it causing it to turn. The Emperor also has larger filter pads and comes with an extra slot in which you can add whatever type of chemical filtration you want (also holds a large amount which is a big plus). If you're looking at the Penguin models I strongly urge you to consider an Emperor model. They are a bit more expensive and a bit larger but they are incredibly effective. If you have a tank about my size, though, you're going to have to cut the intake tube as it is a lot longer than the Penguin models.Anyway, I decided to write this because I'm getting sick of my Penguin 150 and I'm about to retire it for a HOT Magnum also by Marineland."
184848,1,"Discovered mites one day and ordered this. One use and they were gone. My 7 leopard geckos are quite happy now. Before spraying, I removed all decorations and washed in boiling water.

181014,1,"The toy is great for dogs that don't ""shred"" other rope toys. My lab mix usually takes traditional rope toys, chews on them, then rips out the string piece by piece. This ""shredding"" process was repeated on this toy and while it held up to the chewing (did not puncture), him ripping the toy did not end so well. He quickly ripped off the end pieces and ripped apart the middle parts of the toy. Great for other dogs that aren't as determined to shred though! On a final note, my dog does seem to like this toy more than other rope toys."

90725,1,"I order three Large Coolaroo beds in green. I don't understand why people are complaining about assembly. I put three together in less than 20 minutes! There are 4 screws and a total of 9 pieces (including the cover). First you insert the two longer pieces into the pockets on either side of the cover. Next, you insert one of the smaller pieces into one of the ends of the fabric. Then, you take a curved leg piece and attach it to the longer piece of the frame (they fit together easily). Next (making sure that the leg meets the shorter piece of the frame and that the indented part of leg should face the inside), insert a screw into the hole and tighten with a philips head(don't tighten all the way). Repeat these steps on the other side, again not tightening the screw all the way. Continue onto the other side of the bed and repeat steps 2 more times. When attaching the last leg (especially if you tighten the screws to tightly) it takes a little bit of muscle to get the leg to line up with the frame. After the last leg is on, tighten all of the screws (making sure that the bed is flatly on the floor).These seems very sturdy! My Basset hounds love them, as do my mixed breed hounds. They are low enough to the ground that my bassets do not have trouble getting off and on, while doing a good job of keeping them off of the ground. I've got these out on our patio so that my hounds can enjoy fresh air and relax outside!"

I've gotten a few other balls that don't make any noise, which are mostly ignored...despite enticements like a flashing light, or wobbly rolling. Nope, it needs to make noise like these do. And they like the shiny. I like the shiny too, because it helps me find them when they've been batted behind a fake plant! Aside from batting them around on their own, they also love for me to toss them down the hallway so they can gallop after them. Neither are showing any inclination to fetch them back for me to do it again, though. Darn. ;) This means they crouch by them, looking between me and the ball impatiently, waiting for the slow human to come get it and throw it again. So the Shimmer Balls also encourage human exercise. *g*Since they've already managed to permanently hide two of the balls after a couple of weeks, I can tell I'm going to need to keep a regular supply on hand. If I find them in a larger package, I'll be getting it. 5 claws up!"
81370,2,"I gave these treats to my dog (7 lb. shih-tzu/poodle mix) for years. She always ate every last crumb. A few months ago, however, I went to give her a treat. The treats are sold in sealed (glued down flap) paper bags, but I always kept them in an air-tight container because it was easier. When I went to give them to her, I saw a tiny worm on one of the treats. This container was air-tight, so I don't think it would have gotten in there from my house. Then, I looked in the smaller container I kept in her travel bag and it was full of FLIES! Needless to say, I threw all of them away immediately.The scary thing is that I went to purchase a bag a year or two before and there were flies all inside of one bag of the same treats. Figuring it was a fluke, I alerted a salesperson to remove that bag. My little dog would vomit every so often, and I just figured that was normal because she has digestive issues. Now I think that these treats were making her sick! I switched to Blue brand treats and she loves them and hasn't been sick once! I will never buy another Mother Hubbard product.I have read a lot of reviews on this product and it looks like I'm in the minority of not liking it, but if I can save a poor dog from regular vomiting, I guess it was worth it!"

I emailed the company and this is there response.""With a pyramid in fast-draining soil, there are a couple of things to watch. They take five gallons of water 2 to 3 times a week minimum, depending on your drainage. They won't necessarily hold a level of water with a sandier soil, but you want to water often enough to be sure that the soil never dries out. If it drains in under an hour you will want to water it daily (five gallons once a day is sufficient). The digester powder is a tablespoon per dog, per week. Add the digester powder after you have added the water so that it doesn't drain out too quickly with the water. If you do find that you need to water the unit daily, you may want to throw in an extra tablespoon of digester powder a second day during the week. If you have city water, let it sit out in an open container a day ahead of time so that the chlorine can evaporate out. Chlorine will stop the enzymes from working properly. You can always try to add a thicker layer of soil at the bottom to try to slow down the drainage.""I just got there response today, so I will try there suggestion and see if it works.. Hope this helps with your decision to purchase."

The pads appear to be the same quality as the name brand ones, except that they are packed together before the plastic has completely dried, so they stick together. When you separate them, you end up with small holes in the bottom of almost every pad.So if you are using a mat holder, then you are fine except you'll need to clean up a bit of what spills through the small holes. But if you are using these in another room without the mat holder, then be prepared to have to clean up your carpet........."
135506,0,"I have used eye ointment (on my own eye) for over 20 years. I usually go through one tube per week, so I buy in large quantities. While the lowest price available on the Internet, PuraLube has too high a proportion of mineral oil. Being thinner creates two problems: 1. It gets quite runny when kept in your shirt or pants pocket due to body heat (I have to carry it with me everywhere) so too much comes out when you open the top. 2. It doesn't stay on the surface of the eye as long as thicker formulations.While the product description doesn't show it, I found elsewhere that it is 43% mineral oil and 57% white petrolatum. Other brands I have used have 83% to 88% white petrolatum and are much less prone to the two problems listed above. There may be some advantages to this thinner formulation (maybe dogs and cats have a lower body temp than humans?), but I don't recommend it as compared to thicker formulations.It does have a softer tube than these other brands which helps with getting all the ointment out of the tube.I would have returned the other 49 tubes, but the shipping costs and 20% restocking fee were too high."

90923,0,"After reading numerous glowing reviews about this product, I purchased the Coolaroo bed for our yellow lab puppy. We kept it in her kennel to lay on so she didn't have to lay on the garage floor. As indicated in a few other reviews, the initial assembly is a little difficult but really not bad.The quality of construction and build, on the other hand, I'd have to rate as average. The screws would consistently loosen (our lab liked to jump up onto this bed vs gently climb on), and this week she managed to completely destroy and mangle the Coolaroo bed. Was she a little bored? Maybe. But I never would have thought that a puppy could manage to disassemble this thing all on her own.I'd still recommend it, but if your dog has a high energy level, you might be better suited with something a little sturdier."

I contacted petsafe, and they told me it was the collar, which seemed to work fine, but they would not replace either as I bought them on line and no longer had the receipt! I won't buy anything else from them."
132446,0,"The product worked as described. I have a constantly barking dog next door. As soon as I received the ""Dog Repeller"", I took it with me while working in my backyard. When the neighbor's dog started barking, I held it up next to the fence, pointed it, and pushed the button. The dog, immediately backed off. It kept barking for a little while, but on the other side of their yard. After repeating this a few times, the dog eventually stopped barking.It worked great. But there is a problem. The button will not ""unpush"" itself easily. It remains pushed until I can shake it loose. And sometimes that won't work and I have to remove the battery. But for $9, I am not complaining because the dog next door is not as big of a problem because of it.Side note: My dogs hate it. One dog runs away, the other wants to protect me from it and tries to attack it. It's pretty funny.I do recommend, but don't push the button too hard."
25453,0,I have had this gate before and I love it. When I received this gate one of the slats was broken. I was in a pinch for time so I could not sent it back and re-order.I used my trusty gorilla glue and all was well.I did not contact buyer because I assume the damage was in shipping. Again it was a time issue.

101917,2,"I have used Bags on Board for many years, through the lives of four dogs. Now, all of a sudden, the manufacturer decides to cut corners and produce an inferior product. The bags are thinner, tear easily, and very difficult to pull apart. In fact, I wound up with holes in several bags just trying to get them apart. I'm about to throw the order out, and want to advise Amazon not to carry this brand any longer."

160397,0,"Product appears to work well, but I purchased it for a little 6 gallon tank that will be housing small jellyfish. When I received the cable I placed it into the tank and tested it out before I let it with my fish. The cable was much longer than what I personally needed for the small tank, and so there was much still outside of the tank. After about an hour the entire cable was extremely hot. Hot enough to not be able to touch, so I unplugged it, waited for it to cool, and took it out of the tank.It may be a good cable for tanks in which you can place the entire cable in, but if you are looking for something to hide in a small tank like I was, not sure it is the product to use if you can't place the entire cable in it."
3222,0,"The cage is not bad. It is a great size for a larger hamster at a good price. The wire is a little flimsy. Having wire as the second level is not great, we put cardboard underneath for the hamster's comfort on the upper deck. The wheel is useless for a larger hamster but that can be replaced."

87154,1,"The other reviews provided for this product are accurate.The product is small and cheap and simple...which is exactly what you are paying for..so it was exactly what I was expecting...so I was pleased with my purchase.It takes only moments to install and fill. I have had it for several months now, through the winter on a open, but somewhat sheltered balcony. It took the birds several weeks to find it and feel comfortable eating from it. I thought it was never going to happen, but I have to re-fill it every couple of weeks now.I cleaned the window and the suction cups well before installing, following some of the other reviews suggestions and it has never fallen down. I have not had any problems with birds hurting themselves by flying into the windows either.My only complaint is that there is a crack in the bottom where the plastic meets which is unfortunate because when you fill it some of the seed will spill out there, so I have to make sure to fill it outside to avoid making a mess. I think they could have avoided that when making it, but I imagine this would make it easy to clean/rinse out, if you felt like you wanted to do that.I'm happy with the purchase and would consider getting another."
69749,0,"I did check different sites on line and this was the best price I could find. I would say that it actually has only worked while the dogs barked about 1/2 of the time but I am able to hand control it - it definitely gets their attention!Bottom line, it works very well manually along with a verbal command.If you are looking for a control device while you are at home to manage barking at front doors, people walking by, etc. this would work great."

176601,0,"My Rottweiler/German Shepherd mix (85 pounds) loved this bone! He licked all the peanut butter out in about a day, though. He is still carrying it around, but I imagine within a couple days he'll be bored again. I tried this bone as an alternative to the messy but meaty mammoth bones. It wasn't a totally failed experiment...he does like the bone, but the mammoth bones are only a bit more expensive and last ages longer. This is a nice solid bone, though. My dog chews through rawhides in less than an hour, so we don't get him anything too soft or it's gone immediately.In short, very hard bone that will last a while, but the filling can be removed very quickly."
117742,0,"I got this on a whim while I was shopping at a discount store. I brought it home and it smells pretty good and as a funny I put some on my cats. One hates it, the other doesn't seem to be bothered by it. It's a very woody, strong smell and I would use it sparingly if you get it. They can lick at their fur and not be affected by the perfume. The smell leaves after about 3-5 hours."

24621,0,"I've had it almost a week now. One of my two cats found it interesting for about one hour. The other would sit and stare at it off and on for three days. Neither has taken a drink from it. But that's the way of cats.I give it 3 stars because it does indeed work as promised. And even after a week the water appears clean. I can't say the same happens with the other two namebrand cat fountains that I have.There was no plastic smell except for a rather strong one in the soft plastic tube that runs from the pump to the connection on the bowl. But it didn't seem to alter the water any. But I don't have the nose of a cat.UPDATE 01/05/2009It's two years later and my Drinkwell pump died. To tide over my cat (who desperately misses his Drinkwell) until the replacement pump arrives, I pulled this out of the closet. It's been nearly 2 weeks and guess what? He still finds this entertaining and will sit an stare at it every so often, but has yet to take a drink. He even goes over an smells around it, and seems to want to take a drink sometimes, but doesn't.My guess is that he finds the bubbles/rush of air disturbing?"

192606,0,"My Jack Russell terrier mix loved this treat. More than life itself. He had it out of the ball in no time flat, so that wasn't much of a puzzle. But the treat is like crack for dogs. It's the only thing he's guarded. He's never growled when his dinner or a juicy beef bone is approached. He'd leave either for a chance for some lap time. But not with this treat.So...I would be wary. I'm just hoping it won't make him guard other things now.Oh, and for the price? It seems like they could include two treats, which the ball will accommodate.ETA: the ball does seem to be durable, which is good."

81898,0,Product meets the description and works as advertized; the only reason it has three stars is because the stiching is single threaded - but for the price it works and does the job. I will recommend it because you can get is double-stiched at local shop.

125064,2,"I have a Labrador and wood floors and the soft claws do not improve the relationship. It has been a bit like tap shoes for a child at Christmas.The claw guards went on fine and have stayed on (I was rather hoping that they would fall off, I am going to find out today how to take them off).The plastic of the claw guard is softer than keratin of claws and without sharp edges so if scratching was the primary issue it might be a help.However putting a cap on anything is going to make it longer and for these it is a minimum of 4 mm. Immediately Abby made more noise on the floor and I think she was also getting even less traction on the floor than before. The Soft Claws were just not soft enough to be helpful. She sounds like a walking snare drum.The best answer is going to be weekly nail sanding.Abby did get 2 complements on how good her nails looked including ""you've had Abby's claws done"" ie it look almost natural. (The ones I got were NOT purple.)"

176905,2,Better option: put plastic grocery bags in your receptacles and reuse them over and over again. Or just dump them and resuse. Continually buying these is idiotic and a waste of money.
213232,2,"The structure of the toy was maintained by thin plastic cords. Lucky the Red-Lored Amazon bit through these in five seconds flat. He did really enjoy spilling little beads all over. (At least he enjoyed watching me crawl around picking them up before the dog ate them.) Then, it took him five minutes at least to break the central top in half. On the bright side, I got several other equally fun, and slightly more rugged toys from this company also, and they have great prices. Good company overall. Buy several toys from them at once to save on combined shipping."
129355,1,"this is a very well built feeder, made from sheet steel not cheap aluminium; the lid to fill the feeder is easy to operate, it has these arms that are made to hook onto the cage which makes it so secure that no animal can dislodge it once installed.the screen bottom keeps the food dry & allows the crumbs to fall through so you do not end up with a feeder full of crumbs.I do not remember how much it holds but you will not be disappointed with this purchase. I highly recommend this feeder"
100554,0,"Filled it with 8 gallons of water and waited for my dog to swoon over the new coolness and comfort of a water bed. She has been on it about 4 times (in about a month), but still prefers the tile floor in the kitchen. I wonder if I put it in the middle of the kitchen floor? I think not."

I opened the bag last week to find that they were completely moldy.My pups love them, and I've given bags of them as gifts to other dog friends -- have always recommended them. But now my recommendation will come with a caveat: KEEP THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR!They must have changed the formula, because they are much softer and crumblier than in the past. I don't know whether I'll buy them again now. Too bad!I also bought some of the salmon oil at the same time, and have put it in the 'fridge in hope that it won't go bad."
69728,0,"I bought this for my very territorial papillon. She is obviously very bothered by the ultrasonic noise and immediately quits barking and hides whenever it goes off. However, it rarely goes off on its own. I usually have to press the manual control to get her to shut up. Sometimes it'll automatically go off (and sometimes it goes off at nothing) but it doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between barking and other noises very well. The good thing about it is that I can easily take it off of the wall where I mounted it and carry it around the house with me. So, if I have company, I just need to keep it near me so I can set it off whenever she starts barking at this unwanted guest."
160833,1,"This is our # 1 rated cat toy. In addition to owning 7 cats, now I also foster for the Rutherford County, NC Humane Society. I have owned every incarnation of this toy ever made and no one has improved on it. I have had at least one of these in my home for more than 12 years now. The kittens love it, the older cats still play with it, and when interest fades in all the other toys they come back to this one. If you put it part way under a obstacle of some sort (like a chair, sofa, large bowl) it makes it even more fun, I have even had cats play with it while upside down! It is easy to clean and sanitize then just replace the cardboard scratching pad in the center and it's good to go for the next group of foster kittens.I have my original one which as I said must be at least 12 years old, plus another 4 or 5.I have purchased more complex versions of the track/ball concept that the cats lost interest in much faster. Some had parts that broke off or battery operated components that wore out quickly etc. I have thrown out at least 6 different versions.I think the biggest difference in this and all the others is that the ball is the perfect weight so it keeps rolling. The track has a grove in the bottom that catches debris so it does not obstruct the balls path and the slight inward curve keeps the ball from coming out and getting lost, yet with a little effort it can still be popped out for cleaning.You may initially have to play with your cats with it, roll it fast to get their attention then bat it back and forth with them (it's always good to have interactive play anyway) then once your cat starts playing with it they continue to play with it.We have one cat that is 11 years old and he lays on his side, hits it hard with one paw and stops it before it gets back around with the other, without watching! just by sound! he gets it going back and forth so fast you can't see it, lol.We have cats that will play with it together trying to hit it hard enough to get it past the other and then catch it and do it again.I like to rotate toys in and out as the cats get board but this one is one that stays out most of the time.I have toys that I paid $40.00 and even $50.00 for that the cats just looked at, then looked at me as if to say , you paid money for that? (Worst was a toy that looked like a gumball machine, battery operated, you turned on and a small fan started up in the bottom and was supposed to make a bunch of little twisted paper pieces that were supposed to resemble butterflies fly around inside and randomly spit one out of a hole near the top. Instead you turned it on and they either all stuck together at the bottom or they all spit out at once. Even the kittens showed absolutely no interest.Buy this toy, if your cat is at all playful it will love this one. Don't forget to sprinkle a little of the included catnip on the cardboard center to peak their interest, the only other thing I do is from time to time I will buy those balls that have a blinking LED inside and replace the original for a while and that is really fun with the lights out.This is the only cat toy I have ever gushed about, lol."
27695,0,My dog liked it but it lasted only for a couple of days - just like any other toys he had.
177292,1,"We picked up this collar at petsmart over a year ago, and it has worked wonders for our dog. she went through beginning and intermediate obedience (she is a border collie) and did great, but was NOT cooperating with the transition to off leash work- we tried so many different methods and finally we decided to use this with off leash work, and she now does wonderfully off leash. Like I said, we purchased this over a year ago and it is still going strong today. She has jumped in the water with it on multiple occasions as well. I will say that if your dog has longer, thicker fur, you have to either put it on pretty tight (tighter than i like to) or the instruction booklet suggests to trim a small part of the fur where you will position the box- I usually just separate the fur around the probes once i put it on and this works fine."
214507,0,"I have been using this litter for several years and I love it. It clumps great, and has outstanding odor control; my litter box is down stair and I have four cats. My house never smells of cat urine or feces, and people are surprised that I have four cats and how my house does not smell like I have cats.Note: If you have young kittens DON""T use any clumping litter because kittens just like human babies put everything in their mouth and when they come across any litter that got tracked onto the floor they will eat it and unless they receive immediate medical attention they will die. I fostered four kittens and their mother. Two of the kittens ate a very small amount of litter that the mother cat tracked onto the floor. Both kittens got extremely sick and had to spend spend three day at the animal hospital. After that incident I only used shredded newspaper until the kittens were old enough; about two and a half months old. I had no problem transitioning the cats to the clumping litter once they were old enough."
58963,0,Cute toy but my Doxie (who looks just like this toy) had this thing torn up in just a couple of hours but he does do that with most of his toys to be honest except the ones that are REALLY made well but they can be pricey.Nice toy though.
109433,0,Very small. I thought it would be tennis ball size. It gets very fuzzy quickly and the dog gets choked on the fuzz. I wouldn't recommend it.

Get one of the older models if you want one of these!"
6468,1,"I've been using Angels' Eyes on my cream-faced Pomeranian for about 4 months. The tear-staining is reduced to a pinkish (not brown) color and is sometimes almost gone. Staining around her mouth--where she licked--is entirely gone. The most amazing thing about this product, though, is what it did to her horrible bad breath. Within days of starting this product, her breath had no odor at all and continues to be odorless to this day. By the way, I sprinkle Angels' Eyes directly on her dry food and she laps it up."
114255,1,"I like this item, it was easy to use and did not leave an overwhelming oder. I do wish that it worked a little faster. It's delay in working may have been due to the amount of time the shiping took. It took almost 3 weeks to get here and in the meantime the little monsters were unberable for my furry family."
47257,1,"I have gone through a bunch of squeaky toys for my cat, and this one is his clear favorite. They are a good size, the texture lets him grapple them easily with his paws or fangs, and most important for my boy, they squeak! He adores these things. I bought a whole bag (he does tear them up after a while)."
199130,0,"I bought this after friends raved about the FURminator. I liked this one because it was priced so low. It works well, but I think the newer styles are much better."
142699,2,"It worked amazingly for the first week I had it. It was great. Then it started to get problems. The litter would clump to the rake every time. It'd have trouble pushing the clumps into the receptacle.Last week, it got stuck in the ""all the way"" extended position. The rake is blocking the receptacle so I can't take the poop out, but it's also holding the lid open so the smell permeates. It won't retract the rake, no matter if I fiddle with the on and off switch, try to push it back manually, whatever."

153297,1,"This product works great but you do have to have the ""CatGenie"" litter box to use them as directed. However, if you can not afford the cat genie I am sure you could improvise some type of draining cat pan using these granules and do a rotational wash and dry of them. While they are drying you can put new granules down or previously washed and dried granules. The benefit is they are washable and become scent free to humans. if you do use the companies liquid washing packets with their machine and run out of the disinfectant wash you can turn off the ""CatGenie"" wash out the whole unit by hand. Keep it unplugged and let dry completely wash the granules in a separate container with a very mild and all natural dish washing soap (use very little to prevent over sudsing and extensive rinsing). Remember this is done by hand and not using any other cleaning product directly in the ""CatGenie"" itself to keep warranty intact. Rinse granules until all soap rinses clear, drain and dry and then you are ready to replace them back into the ""CatGenie"" for use until your supply of disinfectant comes in or place back in you master minded self draining cat pan you design yourself. It beats nasty clay litters or any other type of litter because they are washable and reusable for quite sometime before breaking down. Next best step next to teaching your pets to all use the toilet and flushing themselves."
183928,0,The product is wonderful but we have a yard that goes up and down and the product didn't cover all the spaces. We felt for our yard there were spots left open and the dog would be able to get out. I think in a level yard it would be ideal. MG
164482,1,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect. All I knew is that I needed steps for my small dog to get on and off my bed and I didn't want plastic. These are perfect. If I can put them together, anyone can. Instructions were easy to follow. Finished steps look like good furniture. Wood tone looks nice in my bedroom and the carpet on the steps is great and in a neutral color. Best part is that my dog took to them immediately."
58929,0,"I've used the shampoo and spray on a litter of kittens that had ringworm. The remaining kitten was the last to catch the ringworm. The shampoo is great, but be careful when using other medication products alongside or on the same day as the malaseb spray (such as lamisil cream); the ingredients can react and cause your animal a lot of pain. Cue kitty crying and walking backwards and shaking. Ugh. The malaseb spray used alone still does seem to cause discomfort to the kitty though. He will still run to the corner, squeak if touched, and hunch down for some time while going through the peeling process. I do think some animals can be sensitive to the product."
104120,1,It stays fluffy for a long time but just make sure you shake it up every now and then :)My dog loves it and even some of my guests like laying on it. Thats how comfortable it is.
207226,0,"I have two ferrets so I thought it would be nice to have 2 hammocks. One is the one you see in the picture and one is a covered hammock with a small opening for them to tunnel into it. I thought that they would each like their own, but I was wrong. They both want the hammock that is covered. I found them always squished in their together or fighting with each other over it until I made a cover on the ""open air hammock"". Now they don't squish or fight and they each sleep in their own. I recommend buying a covered hammock in the first place."
51628,1,"I purchased the product after reading other reviews and deciding this was a good first try. Not having to deal with any problems before, it was a shot in the dark for me. The product worked very well and on a couple different surfaces without any discoloration, warping, staining issues. I had an area of carpet - just poured it on and worked it around. An area on a wicker basket - the first time daubing it on with an old rag, the second spraying with a spray bottle. An area of vinyl window molding - working with rags and plain old just dumping it in the crevices. No problems on any of the surfaces. It has a very pleasant scent to replace what you are trying to get rid of while it does its work. My only con for the product was that the cat came back to the same areas. I cannot say if it was that the cat just liked those areas or if it could smell its marking from earlier. All in all: Very Pleased with the product."
127184,2,"Yup, got the rebate coupon so I am happy.It is very rare they would miss testing like that and their source is the main one for most of the brands available so what do you do. Gosh!Sorry to anyone who did not see the recall. Get info by googling maybe."

120140,0,"When I first took this out of the package, I was super excited and it was the perfect size for my large black lab. But after a while of playing with it, she tore the rope apart. It should not be to the point where she chews on it and the rope break within 10 minutes. I thought this was great, but she can only have it at some points and we will take it away from her after a few minutes."

114824,0,I like the bed but my dog not so much although he likes to be under cover. He was afraid of it at first and I thought about sending back. After contacting seller decided to keep as would not be worth returning.( Better to have someting than be out money and have nothing) The seller charges restocking fee and S/H is not refunded. I would recommend buying only if you are 100% sure your pet would like bed.
128335,0,"My dog absolutely loved this....for the 30 minutes it took him to destroy it. I have an 80lb Husky who LOVES squeaky toys. He can get really destructive so I try to find toys that will provide him some mental stimulation. He had a great time getting the squirrels out and chewing on them but he ripped up their ""house"" within 30 minutes. If your dog is not destructive like mine then this is definitely an awesome toy for them."
25481,0,"I'm not sure what to rate this... I never got to use it... I was seeking a good priced (cheaper than the stores) non-mesh muzzle and this one was great and even w/ shipping it was still a dollar or so less than the local pet stores. The pet stores by my house offer the mesh muzzle in S,M,L sizes... My dogs fit the medium muzzles (one 50 and one 80 pounder) but I felt the mesh might snag on their nails if they started pawing to get it off. I could not find how to figure out what size to get for my dog as these muzzles are in numbers. I searched the internet and felt the size 2 would be good for my 50 pounder. When I received the muzzle, it was waaay too small. I called the vendor and she was very nice but I could not return the muzzle as I would have had to pay for shipping it back to her and then shipping the new one to me. With all the shipping costs, it wasn't worth the return/exchange... I ended up keeping the muzzle and will donate it to someone or some place who could really use it. My advice is to call a vendor to get educated on measuring your dog's nose/mouth/head so the vendor can help you select the best fit before ordering."

101749,0,"I've seen reviews for a different pack size and how the company made the bags smaller so I stuck to the 120-ct packs which were supposed to be the bigger, original size. Well, my third purchase of this product revealed that they had shrunk these bags as well, plus I think they made the plastic thinner or maybe just more see-through. I am fine with the thickness and durability of the bags. I often get a twig or mulch in the bag along with the poop and so far nothing has punctured the bag. However, I may look into getting something bigger as the smaller size has made a difference for me. My dog is a 50-lb Lab so I'm not a fan of how little extra room I have on the top of the bag now to tie the knot. If you have a smaller dog, no problem, but if you've got a larger dog, I think you may appreciate a larger sized bag."
165009,2,"My dogs are big-time Kong fans. I bought a large one of these and it stained my carpet. The black version feels almost oily and petroleum-based, so it rubs off on fabric and carpets. The red ones never did that. I wouldn't recommend this model at all."
170187,0,"Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago. This was clearly my dog's last choice. In fact, I didn't think he'd play with it at all. Eventually he started messing with it, so I was pretty thrilled. Of course, after a few days, he'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out. Overall, not one of his favorite toys, and doesn't seem very durable. The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it's hard to get to. I'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there, heck, I had trouble getting it. Get something else. Nothing special about sock monkey."

169637,0,Our Siamese cat liked it right out of the package and tore a hole in it. It has lots of back claw marks and teeth marks from him playing with it and we found some catnip all over certain areas of the house. It was short lived though. He will start playing with it for about 5 minutes and then he get's bored. He would rather play with his little mice instead. It does have a strong catnip smell and is perfect for some back claw kicking action. Not a bad toy.

They are very uninterested in all their old toys, and most new ones I have tried. Both of them just sit there and watch me play with it like I am TV! They went absolutely bonkers for this toy!! Both of them played for a long time, and still went after it when they were worn out. It is a really long pole, I finally settled on the top of the fridge as my storage spot for it. With how the nice springy long pole seems to help the ""action"", I am very glad I got this one instead of the one with the pole that comes apart."

After going to the vet and getting x-rays and being told she had arthritis/hip displasia I bought the Dasuquin from the vet even though it was $100, which I thought was outrageous, just so I could get her started on something.I followed the directions but as usual for people or animals they start you out with too much and she had diarrhea. Instead of starting off with too much and then leveling off I then gave her a little and progressed UP. No more diarrhea but I can't really tell if this works. I had her on aspirin before I got to the vet (I had to wait a day or so) and she was normal by the time we got there and hasn't had a problem since. Is it the Dasuquin? Don't know.I'm trying to find something similar on the Internet but the ingredient proportions for the people's version don't correspond to the dog version and I don't know if that's important or not."

107410,0,"I bought this dog car seat over a year ago. It gets used frequently, as much as 5-6 times a week when we take our mini-dachshund out in the car.The seat is an equal mix of good and bad. The good is that my dog will eagerly jump into it and seems quite comfortable when there as she can see out the windows or lie down (she's small - weighs 10 pounds). So for that it's good.Unfortunately there are several issues.1) The pad slides around as it is not anchored to the seat in any way. When Poppy jumps into it, the pad slides and ends up crumpled into the back of the unit. I then have to lift her out and smooth the pad out. Today I bought some velcro which I will stick to the pad and the seat itself. I hope this solves the sliding issue.2) The legs will collapse when in the extended position. It seems they do not lock into place as much as they should, with one side or the other collasping and the whole thing ends up on an angle dumping poor Poppy out. To rectify this we have placed a board underneath that spans the two legs, stopping them from collapsing most of the time.3) The little pad with the travelin' dog logo that covers the sides of the unit, slips down ending up crumpled around the bottom pad. Although the side pad has snaps to stay in place, there are not enough of them. When the side pad slides down, it makes accessing the underneath part difficult as the material is now in the way of the underneath lid and you have to fight with it to lift up the lid. No fix for this.3) We never use the little dish that came with it because it is kept underneath and it too awkward to get at. In any case the dish doesn't attach easily to the seat itself.4) The straps don't lock into place - so if Poppy moves around at all, the straps graduually get loose. So you must periodically re-tighten the straps.So far The Travelin' dog seat is the best small dog seat I've seen. It definately requires some refinement but it works well enough that I bought another as a gift."

Putting your dog in a collar with inward spikes? That's monstrous."
127198,0,"We bought this product to use on our pontoon boat so that our 70-lb. labradoodle could get back on the boat after swimming. It works okay when there is someone at the foot of the ladder to guide her feet so that she doesn't slip off the side, but I tried to send her down it alone, and her foot slipped between the ladder and the boat so that she was hanging by one back leg. I recommend the product when there are two people to help guide the dog, but be aware that, for a large dog at least, there are some safety questions, since the ladder is quite narrow."
91299,0,"This is the second dog bed of this type I have ordered. After my 80 lb. dog lies in it, the cover begins to sag after about a few weeks.

169608,0,This would have been a wonderful toy for my 2 year old if only he hadn't ripped it wide open within the first 2 hours. But at least he enjoyed rolling around in the catnip piles all over the carpet for a bit :P seriously they need to be made with better quality materials.

Every pet is different and it was worth a try, since there were some good reviews for the product. I did not care for the scent much, but that it is not meant to smell like potpourri. I ended up working out my cats issues by getting a top entry litter box and using clay litter. I wanted to use natural litter, but it turns out my cat didn't like it at all. She likes the top entry box for privacy. Every cat's issue is different, so don't give up if this doesn't work for you."
70427,0,"For the first few weeks, but my puppy is quickly growing and this product will need to be replaced with a bigger size. However, I like the design and how it sits in a stand. I think the stand can be a little more stable, but overall it serves it's purpose."
170716,0,"I purchased this bed for my 90 lb shepherd twice. i used this bed for about three years. Dog loves it. I bought it for him as he has back problems (spondylosis). However in the three years, he has had two accidents and urinated on the bed. The cover is NOT waterproof. The interior core was soaked with urine. I tried hosing it down the first time and letting it air dry outside. It took forever to dry and got black small spots (mold). Had to throw it out. The second incident happened less than a month after I bought the second new bed. It is winter so trying to hose it down outside isnt even an option. It would be a five star bed if it had a waterproof cover. Otherwise, its s waste of money."

The feeder does not completely colse and the squireel can squeeze its paw and grab one seed at a time. granted it takes it longer and I do not have as much seed wasted. However, i fear that eventually the squirrel will break this feeder."

154979,1,"My cats and I are happier with this item than with the old litter box, but I feel like people should be aware of what they're getting into. Here is what I found....The Ultra upgrade with the visit counter was invaluable to transitioning my cats off the old sand litter box. If you try this product, definitely go with the Ultra upgrade. I wanted the hood and that's why I bought Ultra, but I also found the counter to be eerily interesting. I had no idea what my cat's frequency was, like why should I need to, right? This counter became an important indicator, however, through the three week transition period. The transition was a tussle because my cats love to dig and this isn't really a digging box, but I did finally sneak the old model into the garage. Post transition, I still use this counter as a cleaning time indicator. I manually pick out the poo when the counter hits 20 (read on about the smell). Then, I change the box when the counter hits 60. It's great, I never forget where I am in the cycle.Ok, wow, this thing smells. I found that I do have to empty my litter box before the box is actually ready to be changed or the smell gets unbearable. I don't care how dry the poo is, it smells because it's not covered by anything and because my cats have one of the super fancy all natural high protein diets. I think if cats eat those saw dust food products, it might smell less for some homes. I do three things to control the smell, first I slide out the box and open the compartment and pick out the pieces and toss them in the trash every week. Second, I got one of those Fresh Wave odor eliminator gel jars. Third, I put an air purifier in the office. I feel like this is a little more work than expected to handle the smell.The main benefit of this product is that I always know my cats are stepping into a clean litter box. I feel this is more sanitary box and a significant reduction in maintenance (cleaning every other day vs every week). I have two cats and only one cat box activity per week, wow, that is awesome. And as far as costs go, I've calculated that this product costs me $0.11 cents per kitty box visit at the current BrillianPet price of $43.27 for a six pack of refills. This product isn't perfect but it's better than what we had and definitely better than competing products in the electric choices."
42252,2,We have a 6 pound Yorkie and this was way too small for him!!! I had to return it!!I did not re-order I was afraid the next size up would still be too small. Very disappointed
24448,0,"We have a 28-pound border collie mix that loves to chew her toys apart or steal other dog's bones. I was excited to find this very thick and solid bone for her to chew on that would also clean her teeth. I can't say I have noticed any benefits about her teeth seeming cleaner but here are my pros and cons list:PROS:-Very thick and solid-Lasts a long time-we've had it for a few months now with no end in sight. I'm sure some dogs will chew it faster than ours-Our dog still chews on it from time to time, hasn't gotten ""old""CONS:-Once the ends start to get chewed on, they become rough and jagged and love to collect floor debris. The ends have picked up carpet pieces, dog hair chunks and any other lint ball type object on the floor and have become downright disgusting. I hate touching the bone and watching my dog chew on it is kind of disgusting too-Because of how heavy it is, if you stub your toe on it or trip over it in the night, you will utter words you hope your neighbors don't hear. You would be surprised how easily it is to trip over (I consider myself careful and neat). Anything that might hinder your view--laundry basket, plate, darkness--can cause you to either run into or step directly on that bone. And it is not a massage, it feels like a jagged rock.-I spent a lot of money (it costs more in stores) on it and figured it would be a great toy that would last awhile but would eventually get eaten. It has only been about 80% eaten and I want to throw it away. Yes it has lasted a long time, but to see most of it remain intact I feel guilty throwing it away even though I really want to.-Because of the density, it is somewhat heavy. Our dog will pick it up and carry it briefly before letting it drop on the floor with a heavy thud. We have wood floors and I worry about the neighbors below us (apartment living) and damage to the floor.I'm middle of the road on this product. I don't strongly recommend or strongly suggest avoiding it. I most likely wouldn't spend the money on this one again but find something a little more suitable to our dog.It is probably better for bigger breads because of how dense it is. If you have a small dog, this bone will be somewhat overwhelming to finish."
124308,0,This product is not airtight. I use it to store cat food indoors so that factor is not as important for my use. The lid can easily be separated from the container while in the closed position. There is a seal where the lid and the container touch but you can lift the lid to stick your fingers in between the lid and the container the seal doesn't do much good.The small opening on the top is great for easier access to scoop cat food out. This is the main reason I decided to not return the product. Ease of use outweighed importance of product being airtight.
108877,0,I am a little disappointed in battery life of the unit. Also the range is much closer than described. After one training session as described by the manual you must replace the batteries in the collar.
145934,0,"I bought this because it said that the 47 quart container would hold 40 lbs. of dog food. It actually only holds about 37 lbs. and now I'm stuck with 3 lbs. that I don't want to throw away but I have nowhere to store. The lid is also a looser fit than I would have liked because I have smart dogs, and I know that they're going to figure out how to knock the lid off. On the bright side, it rolls really easily and looks quite nice."
125925,0,"Updating rating, meant to select 3 of 5 rather than 1 of 5 as the dog is still useable. and its actually good that the signing unit (that broke) is able to be removed easily as there is a velcro pouch it is in.The singing dog arrived as expected, however, I would not recommend it as it was broke the first day my dog played with it. the toy itself was cute and the singing was good when it first worked - but just not made as well as other singing dog toys i have purchased.Probably would not buy again."
161507,2,"I originally purchased the triple crown treats without the locking piece. That's how they come with the ball or toy. The first one worked okay and I thought I would have a great long lasting treat toy for my rottie. Well, he got the first treat out of the toy in about one hour. The second one was out in about three minutes. Reading the package instructions I saw that they offered the locking piece. Thinking this would be great, I purchase three packages of two treats and the locking piece (six treats and three locking pieces). When I received them, it took me all three packages to get the pieces to fit together without breaking the locking piece. Still, didn't work for my rottie. So, if you have a little dog without much spunk, this might be a good treat toy, but if you've got a big dog that won't stop until he gets what he wants, don't bother with this."

178251,2,"I bought this because I thought it would cut down on litter tracking, and I liked the appearance of it. However, it was not as wonderful as I thought it would be. Not only is it difficult to scoop because of the rounded sides, it is a PAIN to empty, even with the liners because my cat likes to scratch endlessly, thus shredding them. So I end up pouring used cat litter all over my floor trying to pour it into the trash can. However, my 2 cats used it just as easily as a regular litter box."
81950,1,Item came nicely packed - the two bulbs that were included really light up the tank well. Absolutely no complaints.
114432,1,"I have over-a-foot-long Uromastyx Mali and this bulb is perfect for him. It's not too much UV like the 10.0, it's a good brand, and I change it yearly. It fits nicely into his 36"" fixture on his 4' long tank. I already bought one a year ago and have come back to buy another just now. The last bulb arrived perfectly and in tact, undamaged. And if it ever arrives damaged, I am sure Amazon would take care of it. It sure beats hoping that the pet store has this long bulb in stock (they rarely did), fiddling with a savings card, and waiting in line, for a higher price. Make sure you replace it yearly to insure your reptile is getting proper UV. He's happy & healthy!Update 8/22/12: This is the 2nd time I've ordered this from Amazon now. I replace it yearly. It always arrives in 1 piece and is a great deal versus attempting to find it, at a higher price, in a pet store. Thank you, again!"
42831,2,"This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food."
50203,2,"This thing is the most durable toy I've yet found for my shepherd/keeshond dog. She destroys tough rope toys and plush toys in minutes. I'm happy to have found something that will last a while. In 3 days there are no signs of wear.However, this thing smells *terrible.* Not just bad, but chemically bad. It is obviously off-gassing something. I get a mild headache if it's sitting next to be for a long time, and I'm not usually sensitive to smells. It's hard to believe something so toxic smelling is okay for a dog to chew on. I highly doubt dog toys are subjected to anything like the scrutiny that human toys and foods must undergo. Short term effects of chewing on this thing may be minimal, but what will happen if I let her chew on these things for the rest of her life? Cancer rates are unbelievably high in dogs and perhaps it's because of items like this.I don't know whether to continue to let her play with it and just give her lots of antioxidants or just take it away."
49755,2,"I bought this to remove the protein stains left by dog/cat urine in carpet. I had already sufficiently removed the color and smell of the stain. However, under blacklight the stain remained. Thus, in an effort to fully remove this I purchased 2 gallons of this stuff. It was a waste of my money. I used it as directed initially then tried different application procedures. Nothing worked. If you need to remove the stain from a black light inspection - save your time and money - avoid this product."

132090,0,"I bought a 6 foot ramp to make it easier on my old hound to get up anddown the 4 stairs to enter the house. It was very well made. He absolutelyrefused to use it though, even with all kinds of treat-bribing. It may have been that he didn't like the feel of the grit surface (good for traction),I don't know.For other pet owners with less fussy critters, it would be an excellentinvestment. Folds in half easily and has a built-in carry handle."
131922,0,"My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5"" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5"" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well. I guess she is not too picky."

He would probably love it if it was a different color and something other than just a ring."
45204,1,"You'll see this complaint in other reviews. The microphone range is half of the speaker range. So while the barksmart causes the annoying dog next door to stop barking when I set it off manually, it does NOT activate automatically when the dog barks since he's more than 20 feet from it. My compromise is, I mounted it on the railing outside my sliding glass door, and when the dog barking gets to me I go rap on the door. This sets off the barksmart and shuts the dog up. This may be a better system anyway, dogs will bark and I just want to curb his nuisance barking. (The people leave him outside for hours while they're at work and he barks when bored.) In only a week or two, I've noticed a drastic reduction in the amount of barking. He'll get on a roll, but each time I set off the bark smart it takes longer for him to start up again, or he'll go to the other side of the house where I can barely hear it. Not my problem then. :-) If he barks when I'm not home, that's also not my problem. Considering this unit was about half the cost of others on the market, I'm happy with it."
125646,0,"I have three large shepherds and now three large wire kennels. When our youngest pup was ready for a large kennel we found this one on line. The price was good and it shipped for free. The kennel was as advertised. I don't really have any complaints, so far it has done the job. It just doesn't seem as sturdy as our &#34;other brand&#34; kennels. The door seems a little flimsy.

34464,1,"First let me just say that the shark is a great toy and is excellently made. My dogs do not usually play nice with their toys so we have to get creative when we buy toys for them. This one was a hit! It is one of my cocker spaniel's favorite. All of my dogs like it, but he takes it if the others seem to be having too much fun. He has a hard time with playing fair, so we give the rest time to play with it away from him. They have many toys, but this is one of the select few that they enjoy the most. The song is goofy and gets irritating quickly, so when I can't handle it anymore I just have to sneak in a substitute and put it away for a while. I also must add that they have had it four about 5 months and it is still going strong. Definitely a good buy!"

55713,2,This hood will fall apart on you! The bulb socket was designed in a way that it is very hard to change the bulb. You must unscrew the cover otherwise you will risk cracking the bulb (I wasted $20 on bulb)because you can reach the base of the bulb with the cover on. It is not made with rustfree material so after the screw is rusted in place then you can't even change your bulb anymore. It won't last more than 2-3 bulb change. I also think because the design of this junk (everything exposed to moisture)the bulb just doesn't last very long. The whole thing doesn't last very long!
13991,2,The seller of this product was very fast but as for the product itself...not so good. I got it because my when I first had my dog she was only a pup about two months old and did not know how to drink milk from a plate yet. Maybe it was just my dog but she absolutely refused to use. And the liquid would always leak out during unwanted moments.

There was no header or rubber adapter to connect to your ribbed hose, no suction cups included. You can use the rubber adapter from the spray outlet of your fluval canister filter, but you'll need suction cups or something to hang the spray bar. I bought suction cups from local petsmart.This should not be called Spray Assembly, but just simply, Spray Bar.Mine was spraying water with pressure, using my 406. Note, there's only 10 holes on the spray bar. I have ranchu goldfishes in my tank, and they don't need too much water movement. I ended up doing my own DIY Spray bar, 2ft length with around 40+ holes."

216831,1,"Was great to be able to purchase Oster combs in the shorter hair lengths (1/4, 3/8) without having to buy a full kit.

38513,0,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Large, Green and BeigeI really want to give as honest an appraisal of this product as I can because that's what I hope to find when I read reviews.I wish I could give the Omega Paw large-sized litter box a 5-star rating, but for reasons I will offer, I can only rate it at 4. (Lowered to 3 due to length of time box ""lasted"" - see below).I purchased a large-sized Omega Paw ""Self-Cleaning"" Litter Box, Large, Brown and Beige from my local PetSmart for $35.00 (plus tax).The box was easy enough to put together although we discovered that my daughter had put the rake in upside down.Once we had it together correctly, I attempted to try it just as demonstrated on OmegaPaw's web site (they have a video you may view there: [...] - Click on the link for TV Ad).If you might note on the video, they don't use a lot of litter; probably not as much as the average cat-owner would use. Since I purchased the large-sized box, I used enough to create a 3-inch depth for my kitty. This was the recommended depth suggested by the manufacturers of Arm & Hammer's High Performance Clumping Cat Litter.As a result, by attempting to turn the box as quickly as shown on the video, it did a poor job. It didn't catch all the clumps, several stuck to the rake, and a good bit of clean cat litter ended up in the drawer as well.So this is the way I learned to use it best:1. Turn the box to the right slowly and watch all the litter sift thru the rake. Keep turning it gradually until at least the major clumps fall over and into the drawer. Then if any additional smaller clumps are stuck to the rake, use your scoop to quickly brush any of these over into the drawer.2. Then, turn it back to the left and wait until all the litter moves back into the box. With a quick tap or two, you can then level the litter.3. Remove the drawer and use the scoop to remove the clumps. You can then tip the drawer slightly forward to allow any remaining litter to flow to the front, insert it into the opening of the litter box and turn it upside down to release leftover litter back into the box. Then simply return the drawer. (Of couse if you don't care about the leftover ""good"" litter found in the drawer you can just dump it along with the clumps.)I have been using it for a week now and clean the box several times per day. If I wasn't satisfied, I was fully prepared to return it. However, I've decided to keep it.Despite the fact that it doesn't work quite as well or quickly as the video might imply AND that I don't feel the description should read that it is ""self-cleaning"" because it isn't--it requires our assistance, I feel it is a much easier and cleaner system than manually scooping a litter box. It is faster and less messy.I feel it's a decent product at a decent price. One doesn't have to worry about a power source, power failure or mechanical breakdown. So next to a perfect automatic truly self-cleaning machine, for now, I'd say this is the next best thing.UPDATE: May 17, 2010It's been almost two years since I've owned this product. A few months ago, one of the tabs broke, so turning it on its side now results in litter spilling all over the floor. I am currently not aware if any parts might be replaced or if I would be forced to purchase a new unit? I plan to look into it. . .I liked this box overall, but it does need improvements: a bit better quality construction (top and bottom/tabs) and I agree with some problems as far as litter level. I found that too much litter was not good, nor too little. If you can figure out what works best with your litter, it does work well and is still easier than scooping (which is what I'm back to doing now, unfortunately)."

100965,2,"During the first 3 minutes of use the thing completely fell apart. The ""bucket"" side of this is only held onto the cheap pole by 1 screw. A coffee can screwed to a broomstick would work better and would be worth more than this piece of trash. Hey, why didn't I think of that before? If I knew what a pile this would be, I could have just gone to the garage and built my own with much better quality in 5 min. or less. I purchased this over other products because it is ""Made in America"" and it turned out to be an embarrassment to carry that logo. I hate the feeling of being ripped off and this product did just that. Don't believe any reviews stating this is ""durable"" or has a ""quality design"" - they must have received something completely different."

147622,0,"I bought this collar and at first we were happy with it. We put it on our dog and let him get used to it for a few days before we turned it on. It worked like a charm, if he misbehaved he was told no, then if he continued I made it beep and if there was a third time he got the medium spray. His barking especially came under control fast. On about the third day with the collar on I was going to sleep and I heard a hissing noise. I got up to investigate and found that it was coming from my dog's collar. It was leaking, slowly at first, then faster. I immediatly took it off him and called the company the next day. They said they would e-mail me a return label and send me a new collar. About a week later I got a new collar (which so far is working great) but I never got the return label. So, I called again to let them know and was told I would have it within 48 hours. That was 4 days ago... I haven't had time to call again but still no return label. I'm worried about getting double charged and I can't get them to give me a way to make sure they get the defective one back. Also, I went to a pet supply store in town to get something else and noticed they have the same collar for the same price, no shipping and no trouble if it needs to be returned. I would check the store before you buy from this company."
41566,0,"I really thought this carrier was cute and would have loved for it to work out. However, without a shoulder strap it ended up being a deal killer. Unless I'm hiking I'd want it over my shoulder, and if I'm hiking I'd want my pup walking with me. I think it was a very poor decision by the manufacturer to not include a shoulder strap.My husband did not like this carrier at all, but I think it is because I ordered the camo color. I really thought it was attractive and cute, but he's not a camo guy (more of a Corporate type...)Anyways, think long and hard about how often you'd really want to have your pet on your back, vs. a shoulder carry before you order it (otherwise you may end up having to send it back like me...)"

I would NOT use this daily for an animal that is kennel trained (for that, spend a few more bucks and get a better product)."
36171,0,"After reading the instructions and watching the DVD, I introduced it to my 18 month old Amstaff. I let him smell it, let it hang on his nose, etc. Once I saw/thought he was comfortable with it I fitted it on him as per the instructions and DVD. I immediately noticed his demeanor changed and he seemed to mellow out right away. Then he started the clawing at his nose and finally gave up once he saw that he couldn't take it off and that I wouldn't take it off for him. Then came the walk. Before, he would immediately pull with a traditional collar. As I set out for the walk he was walking alongside me, I was impressed. Once in our walking routine I started to notice and hear his heavy, and sometimes seemed labored, breathing. I started to get a bit concerned, but as the instruction stated, ""Fit should be that you can just get one finger under the collar and it should look like a V"", which is how I fitted it on my dog. As the walk got longer, he seemed to breathe even heavier. Then came the ultimate reaction from him that made me stop using it. He all of a sudden went into a ""crocodile death roll"" in protest. The leash was wrapped around his head as well as catching his right front leg into the loops. That made me decide that this wasn't what I need to use.I will say that this product seem to work as advertised, but in my case, it isn't the right training aid for my dog to teach him not to pull. I guess it is time to do more research for other alternatives."
104767,1,"I have an adopted pup named Puzzle--she's about the size of a collie (40-45 lbs) and the medium was a perfect size for her. She can &#34;nest&#34; in it and still have plenty of room to stretch if she wants to. She's a dark brown color (like a chocolate lab) and the khaki has been a great shade in hiding her dog hair from the average eye, and it's neutral enough to fit in with the decor without looking ugly. I haven't tried washing it yet so I can't review how well that will work, but I'm sure it will be fine. The best thing is that my husband and I don't have to kick her out of our bed at night anymore--she leaves willingly to go sleep in her new bed!"
85218,0,"I adopted a 7.5 month old German Shepherd puppy who was expected to be a big boy. After a few months, I noticed he hadn't grown an inch and started wondering if he was done growing because he was emaciated during the critical growth months. I bought a bottle of Sure Grow 100 to see if it would give him an extra nudge and it didn't. He is over a year old now and is the same size! Granted, I only bought one bottle and he needed 4 pills a day for his size... So he probably would have needed more than one bottle to really show any results. With that being the case, this might actually be a good product. I like the calcium:phosphorous ratio, but I do recommend that it be given to puppies who are at the critical growth months, or it probably won't help."
17275,1,"Let me start off with a description of my dog and her behaviour. She is a 2-year-old Great Dane that I rescued last year. Very, very smart dog and very loving. I have two children and one of them is 5 years old. She is like a house cat in the house. She has had all the training needed, but walking her is not fun.Taking her for walks is a nightmare. I am 6' tall and around 240lbs and she can pull me no problem. Most of the time when she sees a dog, she goes crazy, by jumping, barking and flipping around. It is really embarrassing. Sometimes she doesn't pay any attention to some dogs, but this is very rare. Before I got the spray collar, I bought her the Premier harness. She can still pull me with this harness, but not as bad with just a regular collar.The vendor shipped the collar really fast. I believe I had the product within 3 days.I have to admit, the collar worked nice and quick. She was on the porch barking like crazy, so I decided to try it on her. One quick spray and she was in shock. The real test was walking her, since I don't mind her barking at home.We encountered a few dogs and she tried barking/lunging, but quickly stopped. One time, she got in two barks, but that is better than ten. My wife might actually be able to walk her this Summer.I gave it 5 stars, but the only problem or issue I noticed was, it will spray if another dog barks. Meaning, my neighbors dog and my dog were nose to nose and the other dog barked and both dogs got sprayed. :) So I wouldn't worry about that unless the dog is in your dog's face, then he/she will get a surprise.For me, I will only use this collar when we go for walks. I don't mind her barking at all when we are home. What is the point of having a big dog if she isn't going to bark and scare crooks away?This sounds unbelievable, but only after 2 days, she was sitting behind our glass door and two dogs walked by. She didn't have the collar on, but she just sat there and remained quiet. Normally, she would have rushed the door and done her thing.Some people complained about the smell, but I didn't notice anything and I think they have an unscented one available."

For general cleaning and deodorizing, use two cups of Natures Miracle in place of laundry detergent in cold water only, on delicate setting. Do not use a dryer or hang outdoors in the sun to dry, as heat can weaken the enzymes in Natures Miracle and render them ineffective. If you have clothing with a strong urine odor, it is advisable to soak the garment in full strength Natures Miracle for 10-15 minutes, and then hang indoors to dry naturally.

62400,0,"I was drawn to the ergonomic shape of these brushes and the fact that it was presented in a nice neat package. Just goes to show that I didn't have a clue about decent brushes.First thing you will wind up doing is throwing out the bag because you will probably get a real brush box. You are going to want to spend your time actually riding your horse rather than taking the time to try to put these back in their individual slots.Second, the hoofpick does not have a brush and having the brush on the other side of the hoofpick makes a big difference in being able to get the grunge out from under your horse's shoes (assuming they are not barefoot).The synthetic bristles of the hardbrush do ok and I have to admit, they tend to stay cleaner than regular bristles. I finally cleaned all my brushes this past weekend because I was getting more dirt ON the horse than I was getting off and by far, the synthetic bristles had the least amount of dirt coming off.The main-pulling come is useless -- I assume it isn't really for main pulling because the teeth break off the first time you try to pull some main. So you can throw that out too.However, this brush set is durable and it feels good in your hand -- though because of the rounded smooth shape, sometimes it will come flying out as you press harder against your horse.All in all, this set looks nice and you think ""wow -- the perfect brush set for my perfect new horse"" (I have the blue since I have a gelding, though!). But as you actually start using them, you realize you are better off buying the brushes individually that you need and not going for the pretty package.[NCJAR]"

196408,1,"I bought this tank for my single male Betta, despite the fact that some people say that the current from the filter is too strong for a Betta. Two months after I moved Squall into his new home, he's doing great and loves the current coming out of the filter. He uses the water flow for exercise by swimming against it, then dives to rest. I fit two plants, two statues and a hollow treasure chest in there to provide some scenery. He likes to sleep in the chest and on the leaves, as well as lay against the statues.The Bio-Wheel filter that removes ammonia proved to be more resilient than I thought, as I had to treat a case of fin rot with antibiotics. Afterwards, I was concerned that I had, literally, killed his filter. But, two weeks later, it was showing bacterial growth, proving that it was still working.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to find a nice home for a single Betta that is relatively low maintenance and plenty of room for both decorations and the fish."

I recently bought from this seller (Mak'nTracks Pet Supply) because of the good price but I do not believe that this is the real product for two reasons. First, although the outside packaging looks right, the color of the actual containers that the product is in are blue. With ALL other Frontline that I have bought through the years, they are always green. Wrong color makes me think something is not right. Second, this simply didn't work.

While it can be used this way, one of the openings is so wide that even the large size Kong treats fall out with little effort.

It is nicely made, and as someone addicted to assorted carriers for my pup (over 20) I can tell you that this one is about the quality you can expect for the price. A big plus is that it doesn't collapse the way that many do, so your pet won't have to endure the 'oh no, my world is caving in'. On the bad side, you MUST use the attached leash clip that is inside, otherwise your pet may climb out of the head opening. It would be perfect if there was a zippable mesh around that hole, or if the bag came in a smaller model. Longer straps or a shoulder strap would be nice. Not the best for a dog under 5 pounds, but would probably be fine for 5 to 10 pounds."

In some cases, people with 3 dogs, saw all 3 dogs start vomiting after changing to Nutro. When all was said and done, I tossed out the remaining Nutro and went back to her previous brand. She has not vomited since. This is obviously not the case with all dogs, but keep in mind you may want to test this brand by purchasing a small bag before purchasing something large.

I have used this product on both my shelties for about 2 months now and so far no signs of fleas or ticks. The first time I bathed my female sheltie with it I actually saw a dead flea in the water. I bathe them once a week and also purchased the pure neem oil and I dab a little on their bellys. I guess the fleas do not like the smell.

56146,0,"I have a 15 lb pug and she uses the pad 2-3 times a day (winter). Although this fits my schedule, comparing it to the Petco brand pads, it's much thinner in the absorbtion department. As soon as the liquid lands, it spreads out and that takes up about 1/3 of the pad. Since my dog will not pee on the same spot again, the pad has about a 3 time useage. The Petco brand is more thicker and the liquid will not spread out so far therefore you have a 4-5 time usage. Once you break down the amount of pads you use a day vs the cost, the Petco brand comes out cheaper in the long run. That's why this only gets a 3 star from me."
164702,2,"Theoretically this seems like a good product, but in practise, my somewhat hyper, and dare I say it, very smart 5 year old food obsessed cat Jasmine, broke into it within 30 seconds. I have the break in on video. I offer up her services as a test cat to any feeder manufacturer."
183755,1,The No/No bronze Five Tier is a wonderful bird feeder. Plenty of room fo perching and hanging birds small to medium size.I got it as I needed a larger capacity feeder I could hang. This feeder holds plenty of feed. It can be used with different feed from sunflower seeds as well. Smaller seed like millet will fall through the mesh. The bronze blends in beautifully hanging from a tree and the birds are easy to view on that background. I would buy more of this brand!

I added a piece of chain to make it a bit longer and in general it is well built, I will recommend it to friends."
17962,0,"I have two very barky terriers. They do stop barking once the collar emits citronella...briefly. They will bark again and get sprayed again. It works alright; I have to refill the collars daily. The collars hold approximately 20-25 sprays. I have better luck using my clicker. My dogs have learned within two days not to bark, but this has required my constant attention to teach them. The collars work while I am away."

Careful!!!"
197906,1,"Although not quite indestructible, this is a wellmade toy that's perfect for herding dogs (blue heelers, cattle dogs, border collies, etc.) in need of letting off some steam. My blue heeler -- who's been seeing with his heart for half of his twelve-plus years -- is in need of a way to let off steam and burn energy. This is the answer! He also likes to drop other toys -- like tennis balls, Dental Kong toys with ropes, squeaky toys, etc. -- into the holes and enjoys it when they fall out! The holes tend to get a bit rough and misshapen after many hours of play, but otherwise a fantastic toy!"
79019,0,"I have owned three of these, upsizing as my dog grew. I agree with the other reviewers and hope the manufacturer pays attention. I do not plan to buy it again until the design is improved.The PROS:1) It does help with pulling.2) It is easy to put on.3) It comes in lots of sizes and colors.The CONS:1) The underside rubs the dog's ""armpits.""2) The sternum strap loosens up during every single walk and you constantly have to re-tighten it.3) If you leave the harness on before or after the walk, the dog can easily chew through the sternum strap. (Happened a lot with us.)"

MY LFS tested my water to be 1.025, while this hydrometer was showing 1.022 in one reading and 1.028 in another despite tapping the bubbles off the needle. You will want to buy a refractometer after you purchase this so save yourself the $10 and invest in a refractometer. Look around and you may be able to find a used one for $30 or so."
2337,0,"I have a German shepherd who loves to chew for hours on tennis balls. Sometimes she gets so obsessed with her chewing that she ends up swallowing parts of that tennis ball. I got her a Kong instead, a well-made rubber ball meant to last and one that would be hard to chew apart.This is a great ball for dogs that enjoy chomping down on hard rubber. For my dog this ball is too heavy and too firm. Its weight also makes it dangerous to play fetch with, especially should this ball hit the dog in the head/snout. My dog will run after this thing but will not bring it back in her mouth.I like this ball, but my dog gives it only three stars. Perhaps I should have given her a smaller size ball. It's a great chew ball, but a heavy fetch ball."

125195,2,"I have heard great reviews about this over the past few years, so thought I'd try it. My vet said it was no good, but I thought aww, since he doesn't sell it. It's not as pricey as other flea products so thought I'd give it a try, since the part of the country I live in seems to be a flea resort.LOLI did try it and it seemed to work as a fertility drug with fleas.LOLThe package did say you had to use Capstar or another flea killer with it in order to get it under control, which I did, but it certainly didn't do any good, and I went back to my old product that does work, although more expensive.To me, if you have to use Capstar and 1/2 dozen other products to get Program to work, it's not worth it, and certainly isn't going to save you any money, that's for sure."

The amount of food that is dispensed from the machine is slightly off, but I compensated for this by adding a meal and decreasing the meal size. (This is why I gave four stars.) Some people had issues programming the feeder, I did not. It took me about two minutes to program. (Tech Geek) If you are in the market for an automatic feeder, I would recommend this one."
191312,1,"I have multiple cats and a large dog. The regular Drinkwell fountains were too small of a capacity...my dog would have drank it dry. I found this one on Amazon for much less than local and online pet stores. The 2 gallon capacity is terrific, lasts us days and days. It is fairly quiet, the motor hums but I can live with it. The one downside that I found was with the charcoal filter. Even though I rinsed it well before using, there still was quite a bit of black residue in the bowl. It happened every time I refilled the fountain, the residue was present after a day or so. I ended up taking the filter out, and that solved the problem. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."

115183,1,"I was very happy with this waterer; I bought it because I was leaving town for a week and knew my pet water fountain would run out of water way before I returned... This waterer definitely had enough of a reservoir to last the week, but since it's not constantly re-circulating like my other one, cat hair and cat food had collected in the bowl by the time I came home... At least I knew they had water while I was gone!The plastic that it's made of is definitely sturdy - I wasn't worried about it tipping over. Plus it's really easy to clean. I went back to using my electric pet fountain now that I'm home again, but will definitely use this waterer when I go away!"

175644,0,"I bought this to replace a previous metal scoop that somehow fell behind the washing machine, never to be seen again. I really like the way metal scoops perform, though this one seems a bit flimsy and has to be bent back into shape on occasion. Unfortunately the plastic handle attachment is sloppy, allowing the scoop head to rotate a few degrees side to side, about the axis of the handle. No issue with the metal coming our of the handle, just some rotation."
85741,1,"I live in a townhouse complex and there are others walking their dogs. I try to keep my dog on a fairly short leash when other dogs are around. The only way I could do that until I got this retractable leash was to wrap part of the leash around my hand. NOT too comfortable! This leash seems to make my dog heel better. OH and even though my dog only weighs 20 pounds, I got the medium-large one for dogs up to 77 pounds. I feel it adds more strength and it is NOT that thick and the handle fits my hand perfectly. I would definitely recommend getting this size even if you have a small dog. II'm no longer cutting off the circulation in my hand like when I was having to wrap the leash around my hand to tighten it, just a click and it keeps my dog on a short leash. It feels very sturdy and well-made."

204784,2,"We bought two of these carriers (28"" inch) to transport two cats from the west to the east coast. The carriers were perfect for our larger cats - very roomy and the cats seemed to like them. HOWEVER, at the airport, while checking them in, the handle snapped on one of the carriers. We had to fashion a handle out of plastic ties and tape as we had no time to purchase another. Luckily, the airline accepted the carrier. We will be contacting the company for a replacement or refund."
95063,1,"I bought this for my not quite year old Yorkie mix....he barked constantly at our cats and, since we live in a double, it wasn't the greatest way to keep on good terms with the neighbors. First time he wore it and barked - stopped dead in his tracks and looked at me as if to say ""What the heck???"" A few more barks and he figured that he better stop the barking. It has long since run out of juice and battery power, but if I put it on him he doesn't risk barking. All I really have to do is hold it up and SHOW him the collar, and he stops. Love it, love it, love it."
131584,1,"My husband purchased one of these on a clearance aisle and we ""chuck""led thinking it wouldn't last long with our black lab. We were wrong! It's actually very durable and as long as we don't allow her to lay down and just chew on it, it can withstand her roughness. Her favorite thing is the flexibility it has after she's played with it for a little while. The fabric loses the ""stiffness"" it has when it's new and she loves to grab the inside fabric and shake it. There's something about it hitting her shoulders as she shakes it that she loves yet it's not so hard that it would ever hurt her. It is also durable enough to withstand her teeth when she catches it yet not like those tough plastic frisbees that make the teeth bleed. It is by far her favorite toy so I immediately went online and purchased a couple more. One stays in the house for frisbee down the hallway when it's too cold for ""mom"" to go outside and one is for playing outside when it's nice. She does manage to chew the rubber ends off and pull the rubber edged tubing out if left alone with it, so I'd recommend not leaving it out when it's not being used (just like any soft toy and a lab!!). It's also washing machine safe!"

We spend a small fortune on cat litter and strain our backs each day to clean out the 2 boxes that we have.The product didn't work for us. Our cats wanted to dig ""deeper"" than what the tray would allow. Therefore - they wouldn't use it at all!If only the insert was made about 3 inches deeper - I believe that this product WOULD HAVE worked for us.I was really looking forward to this working!!! Bummer that it didn't."

95733,2,"got this delivered on friday and installed on saturday. installed between two 10' posts at 6'6"" high so we could still mow, etc... under it. our 6 month old german shepherd at 62 lbs. spent a total of 7 to 8 hours on it before the screw that attaches the pulley to the pivot hardware fell out (sunday). i fixed that (sunday as well) with some extra hardware i had here and added a jam nut so it would still pivot but not fall apart again. it is now the tuesday and the lightweight pulley is starting to stick in places so when the dog runs it will catch and then let go in random areas. bottom line is that while the cable may put up with the abuse of a 250 lb. dog, the hardware is no match for a 62 lb. puppy. you may want to look at some local farm supply stores for a heavier duty solution."
131526,0,"I purchased a pair of these, of course one was the link, the other was the light with the plug. They pair looked lovely in my 14 gallon tank, although 2 sets was overkill. I have run across two problems. Mounting the lights in the tank was a hassle. I screwed them to two small blocks of wood, then screwed a wood screw through the back of the plastic hood and into the block that was attached to the lights. I could actually set the angle of the moonlights by twisting the wood screw. This worked well for about 6 months, which lead to the 2nd problem. The wiring connections in the light had corroded out. Unfortunately, that was the end of the moonlights. The reason I rate this product a three is because of the price. With a little ingenuity, this is a good addition to the tank, but be ready to replace it in six months. I'll probably find a different replacement."

The claw is pressed against his paw pad, so I have no other choice. I can't clip it off, because the nail is too thick. IT WON'T COME OFF.They just aren't worth it."

134579,1,"Whisper quiet, especially compared to the Top Fin that came with the tank. No problems as of yet, very happy with the Penguin.Update 2-5-12The penguin is still awesome, i just thought i'd follow up with something. The filter pads tend to begin sinking down further into the filter than they should, this causes the water flow to be uneven and one of the wheels may not turn. If you change your filter pads monthly, this probably isn't an issue, but if you're like me and like to keep all the ben bact you can, just watch when you do your pwc and pull the filter pads up slightly to even the flow on each side."
148055,1,"Our cats absolutely love this toy. You can see them light up when we take it out! I think Da Bird could get just about any cat up and playing :) We have the version with the one-piece stick, and have not had any issues with it. Neither we nor the cats have gotten any splinters from it, but I've seen several reviews on here warning about that so I'll amend this review if that happens.A word of warning- cats love this toy almost TOO MUCH. Like most toys, don't leave your cats unsupervised with it- they go nuts with it, and there's way too much danger of them tearing it up and eating pieces they shouldn't eat (the feathers, for example, are pretty stiff). Our cats are so crazy for this toy that we have to hide it when it's not playtime!"
193568,0,"I ordered this Medium sized leash for my pet guinea pig. The photo showed a guinea pig wearing a blue leash with black lining. When I got the leash, it was pink and green, mostly pink.

Other than that, it was a medium sized like I ordered and it was brand new, still in its original packaging."
109290,0,"Many have complained about the squeakers breaking quickly and at least one person retorted that they are for fetching not chewing.I used the balls for fetch and did not allow my dog to chew on them aside from the time it took her to get back to me. They still broke in about a day. Total play time was probably 30 minutes per ball.However, months after writing the original review, I found a lost squeaky ball and it still works. It's lived for a couple of weeks and the dog loves it. I may buy another package."
39441,0,"The concept is excellent, and the execution would work really well... anywhere else. My poor boy could hardly fit. The box looks enormous from the outside, but once you assemble the screen/potty box and get it in there, the interior is reduced by almost half. It worked really well for my two smaller cats. I guess they're more 'average' sized at roughly 8-10 inches from the base of their neck to the base of their tails. However, Monkey is closer to 20 inches from neck to tail base and his gymnastics to use this litter box would've been really comical if the look on his face hadn't been so pitiful. When he went in head first, his head and chest would be crammed against the back of the box while his butt was still hanging out the door. This resulted in a few messes, because he honestly believed that he was in the litter box, even though his back end was over the floor.Also, with a cat that large, the messes are pretty large as well. The clumps would go where they were supposed to, but they didn't fall all the way into the receptacle and as a result, the tops of the clumps would get shaved off as I tried to slide out the drawer. This led to even more messes. It would've worked fine for smaller cats, but for my big ole boy it just wasn't enough space."

I ended up requesting a refund and then ordered a Fluval U1, which is perfect for my needs. If you can have a higher water level (i.e. for fish), this Hydor heater would be great, though."

157569,0,"The installation went fine, but, like most everyone else, we did not use the flimsy plastic screws that came with the door. The plastic screws were so soft that they flexed like old string beans. The main disappointment is that this door does not stop drafts at all! The weatherstripping is so small that it does virtually nothing. And, if any sort of breeze blows toward the flap, the flap sails open as if an invisible dog were standing there. We knew that it isn't an insulated pet door but would have liked better performance than it offers. Heavier duty weatherstripping and/or magnet could do the trick. Next time, we will buy a serious weather handling pet door."
131219,0,"Be warned, the chicken flavor has bright red coloring mixed in with the basted flavor. I gave this bone to my sheltie (white paws, white chin & chest fur) on a blanket to keep the dye off the carpet. I looked over at her a few minutes later to see how she was doing, and she certainly did love the chicken flavor, she was chewing with gusto.*However*, she looked like a murderer who had just messily hacked someone to death. Seriously, and it only took a few minutes for her to look like this because her wet slobber caused the dye coloring to run. Bold red coloring all over her paws, up her front legs, and all over her long chest fur, along with a little red staining the fur on the sides of her mouth. It even stained the fur between her foot pads because of the way she holds the bone in her paws, and if I didn't have dark brown carpet, that red dye would've been tracked all over as I led her into the kitchen for cleanup. I promptly wiped her down with a lot of baby wipes and got most of it off, except for some faint red areas. A day later, you could barely tell. *whew*, thank goodness. I had to laugh at the sight of her.... but you probably wouldn't laugh if you had light colored carpet.So, because of stupid stupid coloring that companies use on dog products even though my dog certainly doesn't care what color her rawhide bone is, that's why I've knocked 2 stars off. Really, for MY dog, I'd give it one star only, but I suppose this rawhide bone will be just fine for folks who have black dogs who eat their rawhide bones outside, far far away from any light colored carpet.I'll be sticking with either the natural flavor with no dye added, or the lamb & rice flavor, as it only has a very pale coloring added to the flavoring."
94909,1,"After reading various reviews on different items to stop barking I chose this citronella collar.Once I put it on my large golden pyrenese she barked four times...got sprayed and immediately stopped barking. I then take it on and off since i have an electronic fence collar too so its bulky with another collar and does not suggest using with other collars since it may interfere. Whenever I take it off she will bark she knows it is not on, but once I put it back on she barks once maybe twice and will stop. IT works! If you use it more consistently than i do im sure it would continue to work. But I figure she can bark during the day I use it when it is at night or too early in the am etc. I feel bad spraying all the time I mean she is a dog they are supposed to bark sometimes right. It doesnt hurt her and she smells like citronella. Def a good buy for the price. Although Ive heard the refills can get pricey since you may go through them alot if you keep the collar on all the time."

This heating pad is better used in the late summer/early fall months when the temperature starts to drop but before it gets really cold. Unless you have radiators to put your tank on like I do during the winter months, I would suggest looking into a different brand of tank heater if you experience cold winters. We've been using the heater on and off for over a year now and it works just fine as far as durabilitiy is concerned, it just doesn't produce a lot of heat."

I use about 50-60 of the recommended amount.My one recommendation to anyone looking to use this is product is not mix this into the pets water either (as the bottle recommends). My reason why is that the product will simply float in the water (even if you put it in the bowl and then add the water). Then if your pet doesn't drink all of their water the product becomes wasted. Instead I take a Tablespoon of wet dog food (my dog is on 100% dry food so this now becomes a treat for him) and mix the product in with that instead with a spoon. My dog eats it all up in a matter of seconds and gets all of the product also.My dog still tears daily, but now the color is clear instead of red. My friends and family have also notices the difference too.Lastly, I have noticed that once I skipped more than 2 days (if I forgot to give it too him) at this point in time the red stains started to come back. So I recommend that you don't miss more than one day until the bottle recommends that you move to a new feeding schedule, else you too will probably see this too.Again, I highly recommend this item."

155457,0,"First, I don't care what anyone says this unit is nearly black. In fact it almost looks like they could have poured the slightest about of brown paint into the black. If you turn it to the side and tilt and hold it in the light you can see the slightest hint of expresso brown, otherwise it completely appears black. I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is.I had to inquire about the unit through Brookstone before it was shipped. Took almost 3 weeks to arrive.There is virtually no litterbox that fits perfectly inside of this thing. No standard ones will without large gaps on the side. This is the biggest flaw in my opinion. Why wouldn't they have use a popular sized standard or large litter box and built the unit to accommodate it?Another reviewer added that she had purchased a Cats Rule litter box and it fit the best. I went out searching for one and I have to agree, this litter box is the best fit. It's not perfect, there is a little room on each side, but the litterbox atleast has a high back and the lower side lines up just perfectly with the cutout for the door. It was hard to find, I almost ordered on online, but ended up finding one at a big box pet store. Note: I almost missed it, it was not set out on display with the other litter boxes, it was up on the top shelve and an associate needed to use a ladder to get it down."
200555,1,"The FURminator series was recommended by friends of ours who own a very hairy mastiff. We started using it on our dog a few weeks ago and it is amazing the amount of hair it removes. If we are going to be entertaining, a quick brush with the furminator stops the dog from leaving hair all over house guests. It also keeps the furniture clean and doesn't seem to bother the dog. I wouldn't recommend this for dogs with very thin coats since the coat needs to meet a certain thickness to really be affected by the blades."
3667,0,"My dogs were being bitten like crazy by flies. I tried some essential oils to no avail. This product is very paste-like, and trying to apply it to 3 big furry dogs was a challenge. Its hard to wash off your hands as well as rub into the dogs fur. Flies were landing on them as I was putting it on too. After a few minutes I did notice that flies were swarming around them but landing and biting less frequently, which was nice. Also, this product is NOT TO GO ON ANY OPEN WOUNDS, which is unfortunately where the flies like to be. The odor isn't too overwhelming, but try not to get any on your clothes. Lastly, this product is HIGHLY toxic and poisonous. It should be a last resort. I'll be trying more essential oils, and apparently diaper rash cream with zinc oxide will help and is more gentle."
8855,0,"Dog liked them and they fit the specifications of the diet. Kind of pricey but since it is a specialty item, to be expected."
23445,0,"Bought this for my cocker spaniel to wear after she got ""puppy-cut"" groomed. She seemed cold even with all of the fur, so I thought she might need a little extra warmth after the cut and it is adorable. I leave it on her all day long, so, after about a day of wear, it starts to stretch out and becomes very loose--especially around the neck. (This is even without using the leg straps!). It says to air dry or dry on low, but I am thinking about drying it on normal and tempt the shrinkage."
205328,0,"I'm going to have to disagree with the previous review of this product. They obviously have a large cat?? These treats are actually a bit too big for my Persians and I have to squash them so that the cats can get their teeth into them instead of just rolling them around and losing them. I would actually rate this product much higher except for several things. I rate it high because my cats ALL love them (8 cats), I rate it high on ingredients because it's very difficult to find cat treats that aren't just dry food in disguise complete with corn and wheat ingredients, and lastly, I would LOVE to rate these for effectiveness in keeping the teeth clean, but I just don't know if they work worth a darn... it's too early to tell. The product does not get top rating from me because of the high price for low quantity and for the difficulty my cats have in eating them without my intervention."
138555,1,"First off, the small picture does not do this ornament justice. There is incredible detail in terms of rust and decay, just as you'd expect with a battleship sunk since WWII. There are plenty of holes, cavities, and hideaways for small fish to swim through. Combined with an elaborate setup of plants, rocks, and anything else you may have, this is an incredible display that transcends an aquarium decoration into a work of living art. One word of caution - this ornament is extremely large. I have a 38G and it essentially consumes 4/5 of the length of the aquarium. Highly recommended."
96425,1,"I've had this product for nearly a year now. I bought it to house my 20 gallon tall tank on the top and a 10 gallon tank on the bottom. At first when I put it together I didnt really trust putting a 20g tank full of water on it, because it is sort of wobbly. But it's held my tank for an entire year with no problem whatsoever. It's a nice unit, and the bottom shelf feature is awesome. I got mine for way cheaper, so I'm not sure about the current price, but yeah good product if you need a cheapish stand."
155047,0,"We have owned this product for about 2 months now. We have a kitten and she had no problem taking to the unit right away. We actually like the unit, but it DOES NOT control ordor at all. I don't know why the manufacturer proprayed this product as an ordor eliminator, because it just doesn't eliminate the odor at all. The other thing we don't particularly like is that the cartridges need to cost less since you have to buy about TWO a month if you want to attempt to control the odor. Also, like several other customers have said, we too were disappointed in the fact that the litter tray is cardboard and sometimes the ""stinky stuff"" gets caught up in the rake and you have to get that out.For the most part, we do like the unit because it does keep us from having to constantly tinker around with her litter on a daily basis. We change the cartridge twice a month to try to keep the odor under control (as much as possible).I would recommend this product due to the fact that you don't have to tinker around with the litter everyday."
73600,1,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer - I FINALLY found a raincoat that fits my dog! My 65 lb Bernese Mountain Dog also has a long length, and every time I have bought this rain coat (from her puppyhood up until now, M and L) it never covered her entirely and her butt and tail always got wet in the rain. The hood was usually pointless as well. The XXL hood still doesn't quite fit correctly, but at least it covers her head somewhat... The straps under her tummy do hang loosely too; however, that's not too hard to fix on your own, and I'd rather have too big than too small. I doubt the XL would fit Lolly as well as the XXL though, as this brand tends to run small in the length, neck opening, and hood. Despite all the minor issues, overall the raincoat is good quality and actually covers my dog from head to tail, so it earns a good rating in my book. I would just keep in mind - if you have a larger dog - whatever size you think your dog needs, order one size bigger."
53476,0,"My two great pyrenees refuse to touch the stuff no matter how I try to mask it in their food. Seameal with milk, wet food, dry food, cheese, sour cream, peanut butter - doesn't matter. Pick their favorite food, sprinkle Seameal on it, and they won't eat it."
213763,2,"My children have had a succession of hamsters over the last year. We bought a Super Pet Silent Spinner for $10. Within 7 weeks the plastic axel cracked beyond repair. Call us stupid or call us sleep-deprived, we returned to the store and purchased another wheel, and another, at six week intervals until one day my husband remarked, ""How many of these things have we bought?!"" We checked our receipts and counted no less than SIX spinners. Each one had cracked in the same place. I wrote a letter to the company's customer service manager. No response. Two weeks later, I called the company and spoke with their customer service manager. She said she'd get back to me by the end of the day. No response. Two weeks later I asked to contact the owner. I got the run around. This company clearly knows the product is trash. I have a vintage 1950s fan which has probably made several trillion rotations in its lifetime without a crack. Our Krups coffee grinder is still going strong after 17 years of daily use. What I'm trying to say is: the technology of spinning is not exactly new or difficult to achieve. Ultimately, this is a matter of product design, the integrity of materials -- and the LACK of integrity of business owners. Don't support this company unless you want to feel ripped off."
144080,0,"It's very cute. Seems like a great idea. As for my beagle, who was 2 months, now 4, he hates it. He chews it, and now is tall enough to jump out. If you have a dog or a puppy that can handle being inside one, It's fantastic. It's compact, airy, comes with a Velcro bottom to wetproof. Nice little treat pouch. Great for small dogs who behave well (or fairly well lol)."
149801,1,This was a perfect fit for our 10 gallon aquarium. We've had no problems. It did take a couple of days of monitoring to get it at the right place and I had to readjust when a cold front moved through. It works as it says and isn't too much trouble.
99105,1,"I have a 16 year-old dog who is no longer able to navigate the doggie door. I bought this diaper and also the &#34;Top Paw&#34; brand from Petsmart. This diaper is superior in the way it fits and contains any urine. A bowel movement is a crap shoot (no pun intended) with either diaper. The hole in the diaper does facilitate accidents with poop unless the diaper stays tight against the tail. I have had some instances where the diaper has contained everything and some where it doesn't. I really don't see that much can be done about it. I have also been able to reuse the diaper when my dog hasn't done anything in it.I first purchase the &#34;Simple Solutions&#34; disposable diapers at a pet store and the cost was over $21 a dozen. I have been getting them from Amazon for a little over $10 per dozen. While it's not a perfect solution, I am fully satisfied with them."
48246,1,"I found X-O many years ago, but then it became hard to find - before the internet. It is without doubt the best, safest, most effective product on the market. You can use it for anything and it is safe. The smell is very mild and IT WORKS. We had cats that would use the litter box and bring tears to your eyes, so I would spray directly on and voila! the smell is gone. Damp clean furniture. Can use to clean all rooms of the house! Great for cleaning stinky trash cans inside or out. Recommend highly."
129051,0,"The machine works, but the tray situation is horrible. Like printers and ink cartridges. Don't be so greedy! I'd be willing to have a scoopfree for each of our cats to use if the replacements weren't so much. I'm going to try the plastic tray with our in two weeks and see if it works. If so then we will keep our scoopfree and think long and hard about another. Besides it's painful for an environmentally conscious person to toss all that packaging every 10 days."
62019,2,I ordered this product but received advantix for dogs over 55 pounds. Thank goodness I noticed before using on my 5 pound chihuahua. I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago through amazon and still haven't heard back!
153099,2,"I have had this item for two years and also bought the newer one. I have had numerous interface with the company with no results. I have had to take it apart almost daily to get it to function. They have shipped me many parts. This is just a poorly made box. Can't get your money back after 90 days. After many tries to get it working correctly,I finally figured it wasn't worth thetime and headache to get it to work. Product support was abysmal. It finally found the place most suited for it. In the trash along with the money spent."
149581,2,I kept it on for about a week and nothing.I actually saw fleas in the house but there was nothing in the trap after about a week!I don't understand why there are so many reviews...I don't get it...maybe these positive reviews are fake ones posted by manufacturer??? really.....it doesn't do any good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
177568,0,"I purchased this dog food for my daschund Missy. To be honest, I did not sample this product but I depended on Missy to give me her honest opinion. Missy loves to eat and has always eaten dog food with occasional bites of ""people food"". She ate this food, but not with her usual enjoyment. I did not notice any change in her coat either. I will not purchase this again although I don't think it is a bad product. I just feel that I can purchase another brand at my usual retail store."
214733,1,I received this product almost a month ago. I been using now for about three weeks. The scalp hair I lost due to chemical relaxers and coloring my hair at the same time has just about filled in. The seller shipper extremely fast. I am about to order other products from this seller soon.
156684,2,My dog was well under the recommended weight and broke it within a few days. I bought a solid cable that has a plastic coating and couldn't be happier!
7316,0,"Great Idea! Not perfect for my cats, though. If you ever make a larger model with a vented, corrugated lid, I will buy one. Great that the lid is corrugated but a ventilated lid would let the litter on the paws fall back into the box. My largest cat would not like the small hole of this model and she needs a larger area to scratch in."
29639,0,"This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years. My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these. It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."
51684,1,"Owning dogs, it is a product I will not be without. When one of my dogs had an injury that bled a lot, this product was fantastic. I will always keep it on hand."
155671,0,My dogs love these. There are about 14 per package. Me female Boxer can chew through one in 5-10 minutes. My male Boxer can chew through one in 10-20 minutes. They do not last long at all. These are cheaper than the ones I have found around town. I hope to find an alternative to rawhide that last just as long as rawhide.
43156,2,"My dog seems to allergic to almost everything, so when I bought this I was a little weary, however we live at 8500 ft so I figured I should give it a try. I put it on her on our way out the door and I didn't notice her licking her paws. I thought it was okay and applied it again the next day. I did seem to work with the snow and ice.Two days later she was sick. Fever, lethargic, and diarrhea. I had to take her outside 9 times that night. I've never seen her that sick even with all of her other allergies. Another two days later and she was still sick, then she started pooping blood. I freaked and took her to the vet. $200 later and the vet found nothing wrong, agreed that it was probably the wax, and gave her some antibiotics to prevent anything from causing an infection through her torn bowels.One week later and she is only half better. I know she will be okay, but I would never put this product on another dog. There aren't even ingredients listed on this stuff. Be careful."
23799,0,"This must not be a good time for me to introduce my 7-month old German Shepherd puppy to a crate pad. She chews them up - has chewed up two so far.Going to try again, when she is a year old! Hopefully by then her teething will have stopped and she won't eat any more crate pads or beds LOL"
196236,2,"Like other people who have reviewed this item, I liked the way the tank looked and the price seemed reasonable. However, the first time I cleaned the tank I started having problems with the pump not working properly. I've been struggling to keep this pump running for the short 8 months I've owned the tank and I'm fed up with the hassle. This tank isn't a good deal, or even reasonably priced, if you have to replace it in less than a year. Pretty is as pretty does and I'm finding this tank less and less attractive. I wish I had read the reviews on this tank before I purchased it from a local retailer."
43743,1,"The pieces are really small so if you have an old dog of small dog, they can chew it easily. My picky dogs ate it just fine and the one allergic to corn didn't have any seizures on this food. I bought it here first before I found it at my local feed store but the price here is better. I would definitely purchase this again."
182761,2,"I have one cat and she nothing out of the ordinary. After using a regular litter box for about 2 years, I thought that I would try the self-cleaning one. Big Mistake! First of all, the batteries wont stay in the holder. Then the machine is super loud. It scrapes through one time then circles back and does it again. It woke me up everytime it went off. The litter pours everywhere and after about one week of use, the rake ran out of power and slowed down to the point where it wasnt picking anything up. I was soo excited about this product and when I showed my friend it, she said &quot;I give you one week, thats how long we lasted&quot;. Boy how she was right! I ended up throwing the whole machine away and going back to my old way of doing things. Definitly not worth your money and I wish that I didnt waste mine!"
144929,2,"This is a huge waste of money! We bought this because we have never had any luck with water bottles for our guinea pigs, so when we saw this we thought for sure this was the answer to our problems, boy were we wrong! This leaks even worse than the cheaper bottle we had before. I now have to change the bedding more frequently and am therefore spending even more money after buying this expensive piece of junk."
169109,1,The kitty sill was a great purchase. My cat has been using it for a few weeks now with no issues. The bolster turned around to be away from the window was a good tip from another user as it helps keep my kitty from accidentially rolling off.The velcro has held it to the window sill so far and my cat is 14 lbs.
37428,2,"I thought this toy was great. Unfortunately, it lasted about a month. I have a yorkie poo who loves it. It makes the greatest noise but once she got hold of the label, the seam opened and it was over.I wish it had lasted longer. I won't buy another unless there is some kind of warranty. But who would guarantee a dog too? NO ONE"
107341,0,We had a Silky Terrier for 17 years. We got him a Giggle Ball a few years ago. He loved that thing. Bought this item for our 8 month old Yorkiepoo.She just looks at it. Item is great but doesn't excite all dogs.
39553,1,"I was unsure of how this litter box would work. When I set it up for my new kitten she used it right away. I didn't read all the reviews but it's easy to use ,easy to set up and the best thing of all you don't have to scoop each little thing out! Roll and dump!! So cool."
210573,0,"It's not perfect but it does work. It gets the big stuff but does leave little pebbles of litter that I do have to clean out but it's ok, it's better than having to clean it all out. The movement is so sudtle that the cats don't even notice it. I have 3, one chubby butt, and it works good for all of them."
35105,2,"an expensive toy for her to push through, knock down,claw apart,stick her head around the sides. i should have bought $40.00 worth of dog treats & thrown them in the cargo area- that would keep her out of the front seat better than this. also falls apart if a human touches it."
184220,2,"I thought this system would be ""Set it up...turn the dog loose."" It seems, however, that it takes quite a bit of time, dedication and perseverance to train your dog to this system...well, at least our dog, a rescued Schnauzer-terrier hard-headed dog! The humans in this family have not been disciplined and committed enough to complete the training. Shall post more later."
111161,0,"This is a great price for such a large package of aspen bedding; however, the first time it was sent to me was in the plain brown wrapper (pictured) and it had multiple tears when it arrived. I may be pickier than most, but I don't like using/paying for a product that has spilled some of its contents while in transit. Amazon did make it right by resending the package boxed. The brown wrapper is not strong enough and the shredded material will make a mess if not properly contained.I have two guinea pigs in a large cage which I change every three days to keep it sanitary and comfortable. Buying smaller packages of aspen bedding is costly and time consuming. I've tried other options such as the paper and pellet variety, but frankly, they don't last much longer, control odor or really absorb any better and they cost more to use. If you are a small pet owner, you should be aware that you should not use regular pine shaving or pellets (or cedar for that matter) even though they are less expensive; the odor they emit is harmful to a small animal's respiratory system.In addition to the aspen bedding, I use two liners on the bottom of the cage, which I also buy in bulk. I would utilize these no matter what bedding I purchased. I have used both human grade chucks and the wee-wee pads for dogs; the former is less expensive. They provide an absorbent layer that draws the urine from the bedding as well as keeping it from seeping/pooling into the bottom of the cage; it makes clean up much easier. This system for small pet-cage maintenance took some trial and error to arrive at; it has worked well for me.Note: The texture here is coarse, so this bedding would likely not be my pick for a smaller animal, such as a hamster. There are smoother shavings available in smaller packages; in my experience they are a lot more expensive.) My guinea pigs seem to be fine with this; rough edges don't appear to be an issue as the shavings are quickly flattened. As a breed, to the best of my knowledge, guinea pigs aren't litter box trainable and tend to soil indiscriminately, so it doesn't make sense to me to spend more on a finer grade of shaving (or fluffy bedding) at this point. The compromise here is that the bedding may not be as soft as others, but it is economical enough to change frequently (plus there is no dust or fumes,) which is more hygienic and healthier in the long run.Update on 07/24/2012 from 09/27/11:My enthusiasm has waned...The price has jumped up considerably (approximately eight dollars) since my initial review and there has been another issue. The last two bags I purchased of this item had quite a few large chunks throughout; something akin to landscape bark. This time, I purchased aspen bedding from Foster's & Smith-their own brand-when it went on sale. While not less expensive, it is a softer, finer shred and of better absorbency & quality. Since this is no longer the bargin it once was, I think it best to look elsewhere."
50053,0,"8 month old lab puppy has pulverized every chew toy purchased with the exception of his black kongs - so I took a chance on this one, knowing it was the 'medium' size and might be too small for him.That said, I did not expect that it would be missing pieces in under 30 minutes. See uploaded picture.I had hopes that since the black kong toys are the 'extreme' it would prove a bit sturdier."
2855,2,"I thought the Nylabone would be a good thing for my Border Collie, since he likes to have a little something to gnaw on once in a while, and the product is advertised as safe and healthy. He likes chewing on these, but he is able to chew off large pieces of the bone - about 1/4 to 1/2 inch diameter chunks. He swallows them, then coughs, sounds like he's choking, and vomits the pieces up later. I don't feel safe giving him these."
62144,0,"I have been using K9 Advantix on my 3 year old Papillon for about a year now. When my dog sees me getting the medication out to put it on her, she runs and hides under the sofa. She just hates when I put it on her. Also, I couldn't figure out why she was panting so much after I applied it, so I would ask people I know who have dogs and they would say to me that dogs pant because they have no sweat glands - but after reading all these posts about K9 Advantix and the side effects and just by seeing how my dog runs as soon as I take the box out to apply it on her, I now know that it is probably the medication that is creating this problem. I thought it was very strange - her panting - she pants with everything she does. She NEVER did this before - just since I have been applying it on her. I would like to say that she has not had any ticks for fleas on her at all (she has very long fur) since I have been using this product. She did when we were using Frontline. So in that respect, I would say that it works, but the poor dogs suffer because of it. I think that I will not be using K9 Advantix any longer - it is not worth seeing my poor dog always out of breath and afraid of me trying to apply it on her. Thank you for all of your posts - it has opened my eyes to how strong this medicine really is. THE PRODUCT I HAVE BEEN USING IS K9 ADVANTIX FOR DOGS UP TO 10 LBS."

189530,0,"I purchased the BARK FREE device for my two 9 week old puppies. Beagles are known as barkers (well, all dogs are). I found that it really does work, on both the ultrasonic and audible settings. I did find that almost anything loud will set it off. Most advertising for this product says the machine can distinquish between background noise and the bark. I have found this is false. I have tried setting the device to high and low sensitivity, but this did nothing. The BARK FREE does work, but if it always goes off the dog will learn to ignore the sounds. I use it sparingly and this has worked. If you are looking for a total problem solver for your barking pet- this is not the product for you. If you've read up on dog training and use the BARK FREE as a support tool, it will work."
134294,2,"After reading both good and bad reviews on this filter, I decided (hopefully) the good outweighed the bad and went ahead and bought one for my 75 gal tank. BIG MISTAKE. The impeller/motor was EXTREMELY noisy. Lots of buzzing and rattling. Tried a variety of things to fix it including taking everything apart, cleaning, putting it all back together (didn't work) and then after reading some online tips even tried vaseline. Nothing worked. Clearly a significant defect.I ended up returning it to my local fish store and one of the associates there told me they get these filters returned to them quite a bit... Buyer beware. You are rolling the dice.I swapped it for an Aqueon that pumps 400 gal/hr for the exact same price, which is MUCH quieter.Also, the Penguin 350 didn't have much room behind the cartridges in the filter box for much other media if you are thinking of adding extra media bags. It was a tight fit. The Aqueon I am using now has more room in it and is doing great."
30978,2,"I have a cat that loves to urinate on my favorite lazy-boy chair. I read some bad reviews of this product before buying, I just wasn't smart enough to pay attention to them. I felt sure this would do the trick. It just sounded like such a wonderful idea, and believed it would work. But unfortunately, it just doesn't. After putting this on the chair, I admit I didn't sit and watch for hours or anything, but I used it faithfully for about a week. I saw my cat jump up a few times, and the alarm didn't even go off. Perhaps it did, when I wasn't around, but it must not have scared her. It's not very loud, or scary sounding. She continued to pee on the chair, right beside the Tattle Tale device. I continue to wonder if this product might have potential, if they improve on the idea by making it much louder, and much more sensitive to movement. But as it is, this is a total, and complete waste of money. Don't order it. I ended up buying a Scat-Mat, which cost a bundle, but was well worth every penny. But if you buy a Scat-Mat, just try to remember not to sit on it yourself! It hurts!"
73488,2,Purchased these liners thinking they were identical to the liner provided with the dome. Boy was I wrong! These liners are smaller and made of thinner plastic. Every time my cats used the liter box they pulled the liner down making the liner useless. Save your money and do not purchase these ill fit and manufactured liners!
204108,0,"My cats really loved this toy but it didnt last very long. It broke easily. I guess you get what you pay, huh?"
54654,1,"I didn't really buy these for the shedding benefits. I was mostly looking for an omega supplement for my dog that was chewable, and not in a gel capsule. My dog had a slipped disc and was in constant pain. My vet said omega 3 can help with arthritis so I decided to get these. My dog also had itchy skin, and was constantly scratching, so I thought this would help with that too.I was pretty astounded when my dog's arthritis went away pretty quickly, within days. Also, my dog no longer scratches as frequently, and her fur is very silky now. I noticed the difference in her skin and fur rather quickly as well. I was pleasantly surprised since supplements can take a while to become effective. I would definitely not go without these anymore! This product has definitely provided much needed relief to my dog. Also, my dog likes the flavor too, unlike other omega supplements."
32331,0,"This fountain works well: my cat drank more water with it, which was the primary goal.After 2.5 years, I found that I needed to replace it once a year. I have gone through two, and now need to order another. I will be ordering a different fountain though, a more expensive stainless steel version. The problems I found with this are:1. The plastic gets dirty easily, and does not seem to last long. It gets scratched, it stresses, it even stains. I also imagine that this isn't the most hygienic material for my cats.2. It takes awhile to clean it. There are lots of parts to take apart, and it is hard to get into many of the small places. You really need to buy their $10 brush set to get down the long skinny channels.3. In my latest fountain, a leak developed near the motor after I cleaned it. The motor is REALLY hard to get out, and I imagine a small stress or crack was created in the plastic. I tried several times to take it apart to identify where the hole was, and see if I could remedy it. I couldn't.Yes, the fountain works, and if you experience none of the other issues, it works very well."

206743,2,I have been a manager for a retail petstore for 15 yrs. I have extensive knowledge in aquatic life. Our store has purchased these pumps for commercial use as well as for customer purchase. We will no longer carry lifeguard products due to the lack of quality and lack of customer service. These quiet one pumps are made with plastic shafts instead of stainless steel shafts. When you have a power outage and then the power surge kicks back on the shaft cracks.When you call lifeguard they refuse to correct the problem and tell you to send it back at your own cost. A man named Neil works there and will not even consider any type of compensation for these pumps and also will not hesitate to hang up on you.These pumps will not last you more than a year the shafts will crack.I know because i have many upset customers with these pumps. Be aware that you may give this good ratings when first purchased but you will not be happy in the long run.
75180,0,"When I first let my two kittens play with Panic Mouse, the more adventurous of my two kittens, Simba, went crazy trying to catch the mouse. It was a good workout for him and I was so pleased to see him entertained.However, Panic Mouse quickly losts its appeal as Simba doesn't even want to play with it anymore. I had to ship this toy all the way from Singapore and have spent lots of money on this toy. Thus, I am rather disaapointed with the longetivity of Panic Mouse.Da Bird on the other hand is always a favourite with my two kittens and they display acrobatic skills trying to catch the bird."
157688,0,I was very pleased with this product until today. Iv had it about a month now. It is very cool and cool. My dog likes it and lays on it and it did not leak in the month I'v had it. How ever this morning I found it fliped half way over and my husky had pulled off the red stopper on the bottom and chewed it up and half the water in came out and into the carpet. I wish the stopper on the bottom was protected in some way so dogs could not get to it or pull it out. Then again its hard to protect anything against a husky. The bed does cool extreamly well and I liked the product more then I thought and so did my dog. I will try to get a new stopper and figure out how to cover it or maybe spray it with an anti chew scent.

12873,0,"I bought this cage thinking awesome a nice big cage with toys for my sugar glider. When I got it I put it together and put my sugar gliders inside, only to find that they slid right through the bars. I actually had to tape up the bars for a night so they wouldn't get out of the cage. The next morning I went a bought a brand new cage. Its a really nice big cage but if you have small animals the size of a sugar glider they WILL get out."

175951,1,"My husband's cat doesn't like beds with high sides, and I don't like his hair all over the place, so we use inexpensive beds like these placed in his favourite spots to encourage him to nap there and not on the clean towels I'm trying to fold. The extra small size is perfect for his spot on the couch, and I can wash and dry the cat bed instead of having a permanently hairy, cat dander-y spot on the couch. The beds aren't expensive, so when they won't take another wash, I just get another. Cat is happy and so am I...win-win!"
23368,0,"I bought this medicated shampoo as a replacement for Malaseb, which is no longer available. It worked to stop my cat's itching, but it left his coat a little dry and flat, rather than fluffy, soft, and silky. The next time I use it I'll mix it 50/50 with another shampoo to improve the finish."
58008,0,"It seems like a nice durable toy but my dog could care less. A few sniffs, nose up, and that was that. Doesn't matter what treats are in it or even if we dispense them. I thought it would be nice for a bored dog, but this is a dog that, apparently, prefers boredom to gastric pleasure. I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be well constructed, but not five stars since it was utterly pointless purchase, at least for me."
178244,0,"I REALLY wanted to like this litter box. I bought it thinking that it would keep the dog out. It might have done so, if only my cats would go in it. Despite the visually large size of this box, the inner cavity is actually quite small and narrow, compared to our old box, the Large PetMate box. The day after I got the Booda Cleanstep box, my standard-sized tabby peed on the couch (first time ever), so I went to investigate the box and see if it had been used. I lifted the lid and the cat immediately ran to it to do her business. Even with the lid OFF it was difficult for her to turn around properly. As for other people's complaints: yes, the box is made of a very flexible plastic, making it a bit tricky to get the top to fit snugly onto the bottom. The lid does NOT latch onto the bottom; to move the box you'll have to bend down and embrace the whole thing (yum)."
117350,1,"In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!These little treats are wonderful. I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients. As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took). Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable! The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min). With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him). He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique. This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars). I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone. He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats. It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product. If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?"

164854,0,"I bought this knife a couple of years ago and enjoyed using it for a while. The blade kept a sharp edge but the serrations on the inner edge would sometimes cut my thumb as I released the lock bar to close the blade. They were like little razor blades. Eventually, the knife jambed open and when I attempted to repair that the knife fell apart and I chucked it."
103107,2,"I bought two at petsmart, just returned them (luckily they have a good return policy). The two leads were only THREE MONTHS old and already the cable was quite rusted (making it doubtful that it is properly galvanized). Plus within 5 days of each other, the rust caused the cable to cleanly separate on both leads. This resulted in the dogs escaping and running through the neighbor's yard.It also wasn't the dogs' weight, one is 75 lbs and one is 35 and this is supposed to be rated at 125lbs."
142278,1,this is a great toy for my dog. He loves pulling the balls out of it. It's made very well so we'll hopefully get lots of enjoyment from it.
139568,2,"I bought that 10 inches clamp for the 250 watts infrared heat ceramic emitter (there were shown as matching). After a year and a half (almost constantly on for my two cats sleeping area) the wire that enters the ceramic head of the clamp lamp burned inside and melted the plastic a bit so there was a short. The lamp clamp stopped working since the wire inside were corroded with the screws and as a result,no longer connected."
47080,0,"My dog did de-stuff this toy relatively quickly, though it did take longer than the average stuffed toy. What I liked was that the squeakers are sewn into their own fabric pocket inside the toy, so they don't just fall out with the fluffy stuffing. That way they work longer, and if you're concerned about your dog swallowing the squeakers you can get take the squeaker out yourself once your dog [inevitably] removes the stuffing.Also, the outside off the toy lasted a long time after its insides were dismantled. It gave my dog several weeks of fun just shaking it around and tugging on it, until a day when he was frustrated enough to shred it. But most soft toys don't last this long with my dog. I'm not sure what it's made of though, so avoid letting the dog swallow it. This is always true, of course, but whatever makes this tougher to play with also probably makes it tougher to digest!"
132549,1,"My 80 year old mother likes to work every day in her back yard flower garden. The 2 big dogs that live next door constantly bark and jump against our 6 foot wooden fence and tried to tunnel under at her each time she went outside. I bought the dog repeller for her. We didn't know if it would work. The first time she heard the dogs barking and running toward our fence she pointed it at them and pushed the button and the dogs shut up suddenly. One laid down and just stared , the other ran back to the other side of his house. We have not had any more trouble with them at all. Mom keeps the dog repeller in her pocket when she is in the yard, just in case, but has not had to use it again... smart dogs I guess. I got another for my husband for when he takes his walks around the neighborhood."
68732,1,This ball is very entertaining. Our dog was a little unsure about it at first but now he loves this thing. We have had hours of fun just watching him with it. It is very durable. Our lab/shepard mix can chew up anything but has yet to destroy this toy. It can get annoying at times with all the chatter from it and definately needs to be put up at bed time but overall it is well worth the money spent.

This post is made of sisal, but my cats are used to sisal with a more rope-like quality. This sisal is woven, and for whatever reason they just refuse to use it to scratch. Just be aware that your cats may be like mine, especially if they're used to a post with a different texture. As it would have cost $20 to ship it back to Amazon, I donated the post to a local animal aid society."

174749,1,"Out of any product I have purchased for my dogs this has been my favorite. I have two dogs, one of which gets herself so excited in the car that she starts making extremely loud ""screaming noises"". It isn't that she hates the car (in fact she jumps in ready to ride), she just gets so worked up by the movement and commotion of things going on outside. We go hiking quite often and it was very hard to take her with us. A dog behaviorist recommended this product to us and it has been amazing. Since the top is mesh, we cover the top with a dark colored thin breathable sheet that doesn't allow her to see out. She climbs in and rests until we get to our destination.The pet tube seems very well constructed. I have two german shorthaired pointers who have a tendency to be quite rough on products and it has held up very well against them. Both dogs actually have enough room to move around inside around, although they tend to just lay down inside for most of the trip.I just wish I had this product years ago."
196284,0,I just started on my second filter after the first malfunctioned. Discussion with a pet store employee revealed that the water level in the aquarium must be above the impeller inside the filter and thus close to or touching the part of the filter that sits above the aquarium. So you should definitely unplug the filter when changing water and make sure you refill it close to the top. If the filter is allowed to run when the water level is low the motor will burn out. Also Marineland sent the replacement filter to me for free two days after I called them. Their number is on the instruction sheet that comes with the aquarium.

I tried putting her cushioned bed on top of this heated bed, but it didn't heat through. I've tried covering it with blankets, but she still prefers the cold cushion. I'll keep trying to entice her! Other than that, it is nice and warm, just not real cozy."
86026,0,"This rain coat is cute and serves the purpose. However, The extra large size was HUGE and the Large size is almost too small. The changes in size are drastic.

147881,1,"Have two almost 2 yr year old cats and this is far and away their favorite thing in the world. Works well every time for exercise and play. They cannot resist when it is taken out and they even seek it out when it is stored. (Should be stored away safely when not playing with your cat. Not intended for unsupervised use!). Feathers have an amazing flutter-action that drives them wild. They do beat up the ""bird"" quite a bit so I purchase the refills and replace as needed. Easy to replace, just clip on a new feather bird and back in business. A MUST HAVE!!!"

38247,1,"This cat box is the answer to many of the ordinary problems with regular cat boxes at a very reasonable price. It's much larger than a standard cat box so I'm finding that the ""kitty karats"" are more toward the center of the box as opposed to sometimes being on the edges. It's a simple design that functions like a self-cleaning cat box with very little manpower. Also, unlike the automatic, plug-in type of boxes, this uses no electricity nor does it have any parts that are likely to break down!"

57853,0,"I tried this product as an alternative to Advantage because my cats really protest application of that product. Altho I was relieved to see my 3 cats much more relaxed about the Frontline, and my own allergies did not kick up, I rated this product 'average.' Of the 2 applications, separated by 4 weeks, I noticed little to no reduction in the scratching in one cat, marginal reduction in the second, and the third cat was never bothered from the get-go. On a positive note, there is an almost undetectable scent that disappears within a day or so. Perhaps with continued application I may see improved results."
162048,1,Good sturdy ramp supports a lot of weight and gives great traction to the animal but it is difficult and ackward to fold up and takes up a lot of room in the car. I would love this product if it came in a telescoping version.

57156,1,"by far this is the best flea/tick medication we have tried on the cat and dog. While it doesn't stop the ticks from biting, frontline does kill the ticks right away. They just have to be removed later on. But that's just how the ticks work and it cannot be helped. It does keep our kitty flea free all year round."
191322,1,"This isn't my first pet fountain I have never been satisfied with any of them until this one. I have had it a couple of weeks and just had to write a good review because I rely on reviews for most of my purchases. I have three thirsty cats and a big dog and it lasts almost a week between fills. It makes that drippy noise my cats love but has a flow control knob so I can adjust the flow of water and subsequently the amount of noise it creates. My favorite thing about it is its super freaking easy to clean, the motor comes out and it's all open so I was able to scrub the heck out of it without having to worry about water getting where it shouldn't. Lastly it has a long super sturdy cord. My pets love to drink out of it and I couldn't be happier."

210230,0,"This is a nice product, well designed in concept. Works as advertised, nice price, and worked great at first. Then began having problems - started making grinding noises (although this eventually went away), the gears ate one of the plastic bags in the liner tray (required taking the entire thing apart to peel away the wound bag, which was surprisingly easily caught), and then the tray stopped turning (turned out the motor and gears were clogged with litter and litter dust. The motor is now dead). Also, the tray with the litter does not hold the litter all that well - cat flicks it out every time so I have a nice mound of litter just outside the box. Sadly, the litter box is now dead and I'm buying a LitterRobot. I say sadly becaues I think with some relatively minor modifications (v2, if they come out with it) this could be a great machine and I'd consider buying it again. When not dead, the machine worked great and was very simple to operate and use."

But, I have a small dog approx. 7-8lbs who does not like it even in small pieces. I prefer to give them the dried meat products for strong muscles. The packages that are sold at the stores are far more expensive, so for the price, I will tolerate the brittleness of their favorite food."

So I kept a close watch on all 3 cats that evening, and while none had any severe symptoms, Aria and her brother, Octave, were more lethargic than usual, and poor Aria vomited twice.I wasn't comfortable leaving a known poison on my cats, plus it's greasy and wasn't drying at all, so I washed it off of all of them with dawn dish soap and warm water (oh boy, this is fun). While I did this, I noticed this junk just made all the fleas go to their heads. They were covered in fleas there. They did act less lethargic a couple of hours after washing it off. I just consider myself lucky nothing worse happened.Stick with vet-prescribed products like Frontline or Revolution, even if they cost more."

It doesn't smell like other clay litter either. I have allergies to dust and this stuff doesn't seem to bother me as much as the overly chemical clay litter does. Oh, and he uses it instead of the beds although I did have to make sure that there were lots of boxes to choose from."
63753,2,"The only way to keep this collar from eating up batteries is to literally turn it off when the dog is not outside. It has an on/off switch where you insert a coin to rotate it to the off position. They don't make this clear enough regarding battery, if they had I wouldn't have bought it. I got it because of the levels of correction. I already had collars and their batteries lasted up to 12 months but one dog needed something a little stronger."

After her first time, she could remove the bees in less than 30 seconds and she was back to trying to remove the squeakers.I did not give it a terrible review, as it seems to work for many dogs, but if you do buy this toy expecting it to cure destructive chewers, you may be disappointed."

67741,1,I take 'treats' (ears) to my sister's dog whenever I go over there which is usually just once or twice a week. The entire time I was taking her pig's ears she was battling being overweight. After just one month of switching to cows ears she has lost 3 pounds and is much more active. I also like these ears because they are individually shrink wrapped which I'm sure keeps them fresher and they are less expensive than pig's ears too!!!!!!!!!!
127529,2,I was very excited to purchase the Hide-A-Bee pet toy for my dogs but the excitement was short lived. I purchased two of them and within a couple of hours they had them shredded and had stuffing/squeakers all over the house. Both Rosie and Tinkerbell can be rough with toys but this is the first time I've ever witnessed them chewing a toy apart so quickly. After I cleaned up the mess Tinkebell found one of the squeakers she had hidden somewhere in the house and almost choked to death. I had to wedge my fingers in her mouth and perform a doggie heimlich to get it out....very scarey but thankfully she's okay now.I would NOT recommend this toy if you have strong chewers in your home and it was a big waste of money. I'll stick with the large rubber kongs for them from now on.

The package was flatten since it wasn't in a good mailer. I mentioned the dead flea already. Also, the ad didn't mention that this was the European version. I mean that's the same active ingredient and all, but I don't know my cats' weight in kilograms! Why the European version and not the domestic one?"

You don't have to worry about that with this one. Cats love this!"
147765,0,"I am so disappointed with this cheap product. I bought one of these a few years ago and my cats really liked it. It broke a long time ago. I bought this new one and I cannot tell you how cheap this is. What a waste of money! The feather comes off even though it has some kind of (obviously cheap) glue on it. The stick part is in two parts and I have no idea why! The second the cat bats at it, it falls off. The top of the stick will go flying off about 5 minutes in even if a cat doesn't bat at it because it is in two pieces. I have never been so disappointed with a cat toy. I really wish I didn't buy it. I also bought replacement feathers. So, I spent a lot of money and it's just a piece of crap. I will not buy this again.

When the doorbell rang, she would launch into a fit of barking and wouldn't stop sometimes even after she discovered who was at the door. I hooked this collar on her and rang the doorbell. She barked one time, the collar sprayed, and she stopped. I tried it again about 5 min later with the same results. I put her outside, she did her normal routine... then I heard one bark out of her before she stopped. She walked around patrolling the yard, but this time instead of being a nuisance, she did it quietly.I remove the collar when she comes back inside. The collar is easy to adjust and the clip is easy to release and attach.UPDATE: 12/17/2012As of 12/3/2012 (less than one month!) the Collar has stopped working. At first it appeared the battery was bad, so I bought some ""Petsafe"" brand replacements at my local store. After installing them, the collar worked one time and never worked again. I have tried several different batteries, thinking that might be the issue, but now I suspect the microphone inside the collar is out.Will contact the manufacturer for help and update as necessary.As an interesting side note, the petsafe website has a battery replacement plan where they send you a new battery every 3 months over a 12 month period. On the same page is a not stating that one can expect the battery to last 1-2 months."
149941,0,My puppy loved to play with this toy but it only lasted a week and a half so I'm not sure if it was worth it. It came with a replacement ball which was nice. Maybe my puppy was just too rough with it but one arm was torn off by the second day.

79243,0,"I bought this harness on the recommendation of my puppy's trainer. She helped me fit it on the dog. It does help with pulling, but it's really hard to fit on my dog. The shoulder and belly strap fit OK, but the chest strap droops even at the tightest adjustment . When I walk the dog, the leash slides to the side and even to the back. My puppy is a 6 month old Havanese wighting 9 pounds. I purchased the petit size, but I think her chest is too narrow for a proper fit. It also seems to rub her behind the front legs. I gave a 3 rating, because the harness works if the fitting is good."
50739,0,I bought this thermometer for my 75 gallon tank. It does not give an accurate temperature reading. It is about 1.4 degrees off higher than the actual temp. It does not have a way to calculate it so I took it out of the aquarium and it is in a closet already. I do not recommend.
35231,0,"It would have been better for the vertical bars to be spring loaded for installation purposes. It is hard to put together and install in the back of a minivan for someone with back issues.

Not thrilled with the design. So far it hasn't been very useful, but I will keep trying."
60943,2,Not the quality I get of Hartz brand at Walmart. Very disappointed with this orders quality. I will not order this again.
130172,0,"First of all, I want to start out by saying that I would have given this kennel more stars had it arrived in better condition. The thing was not shipped in a box at all, but simply taped and wrapped in a thick gray plastic. The top and bottom were stacked together as usual, but a small part of one of the corners of the top section was broken off. When I bolted the kennel together, the two broken pieces were bolted to the bottom section and I was able to Super Glue them together. I have used the kennel twice and don't think this will be a problem. I needed the kennel pretty badly, and didn't want to wait for the return/replacement.I already owned two of the XLarge Ultra Fashion Petmate Vari Kennels, and this Giant kennel was just as easy to assemble as these; however, the top and bottom sections do not join in the same way as the Ultra Fashions do. I tried to locate a Giant Ultra Fashion Petmate kennel but was unable to do so. I am not picky about the color of the Giant, but was disappointed that it did not fit together like the Ultra Fashions, which can be seen here:Petmate Vari Kennel Ultra Fashion, XLarge, Bleached Linen/Coffee Grounds. I think these possibly are more sturdy because of the way in which the top section of the Ultra Fashion fits over the bottom section's rim.(I wish I could explain better; those who have assembled these things before probably understand.)I will agree with the reviewer who said that these crates are not made as sturdy as they used to be; I guess that goes for a lot of things today. I have had a great deal of success with them, though, by training my dogs when they are very young puppies to accept them. They then go on to be successfully crated when grown. Of course, one doesn't always have this option when they adopt/buy an older dog.This crate is advertised for large breeds such as mastiffs, Great Danes, etc.; I would question whether some of the grown versions of the giant breeds would be comfortable in this thing for extended periods, although it is exactly the dimensions advertised, but I could not accurately give an opinion on this. I have a female Cane Corso/Rottweiler cross who weighs about 90 pounds and who is about 25-26 inches high. She would be very comfortable in this Giant kennel for probably about 3-4 hours, which is as long as I like for grown animals to be crated before a break; of course, puppies have to be relieved more often than that. I also have two young coonhound pups (pets) who have been trained to crate together since puppyhood.I have used the kennel twice for this purpose, and it has worked out very well.Again, I would have given this kennel four stars except for the poor packaging and damaged condition, even though it did arrive speedily. To sum up: this kennel is a good buy for the money; there are heavier duty kennels out there and they cost accordingly. I am happy with it and feel that it is as advertised. If your dogs are trained to accept the crate, and you use it responsibly, I think you will be happy with it. Again, it is not heavy duty and probably would not stand much abuse from unhappy and rambunctious dogs."
24844,0,"Do not buy this dryer if you are looking for a quiet dryer. I purchased this dryer because a couple of reviews on this site said the dryer was very quiet. That is not true. This thing is as noisy as a cheap leaf blower. Anyone that says it is quiet is either working for the manufacturer or have their hearing aid turned off. If you want a very effective and quick dryer, then this is a good buy. I purchased it to dry my husky puppy. He hates the noise (so do I) but after a restraining him and feeding lots of treats, he is slowly learning to tolerate the noise. The dryer does work very well. It drys my husky completely in about 20 minutes. I have no intention of returning the dryer. Knowing how well it works I can tolerate the noise. So if you want a very effective dryer, buy this one but, be warned, it is NOT QUIET."
186160,2,"At first we really like the comfort of the fleece-lined handle. Then 6 months later one of leashes came apart at turnbuckle swivel. The pin broke off. We had another nylon leash 10 years old with a large turnbuckle, so we cut it off and had a shoe shop sew it on the Hemp leash with a leather belt strap. Problem fixed. Then a few weeks ago we were walking our dogs (One is a Whippet and the other an IG) on a sidewalk next to a busy street and the other leashes turnbuckle broke exactly the same as the other. This time we came very close to losing a very expensive sight hound. I went to the company web site and wrote a detailed message to them teling them of the defective turnbuckle swivels weeks ago and so far no reply. These are small and medium dogs and I was using their wide leash for large dogs. This is a serious problem and it should be addressed immediately by the company. These are great leashes but the turnbuckle swivels are defective.It is now September, and still no reply from the company. I would not even think of purchasing this product again unless the supplier gives notice that they have addressed the issue with a better quality turnbuckle."
202062,0,"I had high hopes when looking at the adds and certain reviews for this deshedding treatment. My Turkish Angora cat sheds a lot, and I was excited the first time I used the product set--the amount of fur that was removed during the shampooing and treatment was impressive, as was the additional hair removed with the brush when she was dry. I could have easily created one of those pictures that the company offers, with the groomed pet surrounded by huge amounts of removed fur.However, it did nothing to curb shedding afterwards. She still sheds as much as ever, and I found the smell from the conditioner to be very strong. Perhaps if I keep using the treatment it will make more of a difference, but I was initially disappointed."
188206,1,"Length:: 1:34 MinsI bought these because they are low calorie, so I can stuff a bunch into Poodle's treat puzzles without feeling guilty. He LOVES the cheese flavor (the only one I have tried so far). He stays quiet when being groomed if given liberal amounts of them. Great amount in the bag for the price too. According to their page on FaceBook, they are only 3 calories per treat. In the video you can see Poodle getting treats out of a bottle, it is a mix of kibble, someCostless Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets, 32-Ounceand Charlee Bear Cheese and Egg treats. You can see that the treats fit whole into the opening of the bottle, so they are not all that big. This is a fun way to get him some mental exercise and I watch him so he doesn't chew up the bottle."
28787,1,"I love how much bubbles it makes and how effective it is! It's pretty easy to use. The only downside is that, when you accidentally pull it out of the gravel, it's kinda hard to bury it down again unless you soak your hands inside the aquarium. Digging through the gravel just to bury this (again, especially when you just barely did a partial water change) sometimes makes the water so cloudy. But all in all, it's a great aerating disk! It doesn't bother my fish at all."
208704,0,"Sorry I can't give this stuff a screaming good review. Maybe catnip is a sort of personal thing as our cat Tasha has shown great interest in catnip filled mice in the past but this catnip she's ambivalent to. Hence why I can only give the product a neutral three stars. I stuffed a catnip mouse with this product and she checked the freshly filled mouse out but showed a nearby older catnip laced mouse more interest. I placed a small amount next to her on the back patio and yes, after two sessions, she ate it all but other than laying there, she seemed not to be affected by the catnip. I fed some catnip to her a second time and she ate a bit but in the end, blew the rest of the catnip off. In the morning while my wife and I are on the patio for coffee, Tasha's more animated in her morning play without then with.In summary, I can't say it's not good catnip, I can only say that Tasha didn't show a whole lot of interest in this product. I guess like beer, everybody has their product preferences and for her, this doesn't seem to be knocking her socks off. I'm currently looking at other catnip products, including sprays and extract oils. FWIW, if we wanted, we can get this same product at our local pet store for a bit less then here; including California sales tax, $5.50. When one takes into consideration the price of gas coupled to the time it takes to shop for a product of this kind, this is a reasonably priced product. I'll keep trying to interest Tasha in this product as I'm not going throw the catnip away. And if she shows more than a passing interest, I'll stop by, change my star rating and amend what I've written here. Until then, hope my above helps with your shopping decision."
111005,0,"So I am 68 and my knee has begun giving out on me! It feels stiff and I did not injure it. It just began this stabbing pain if I turned it a certain way sometime after Christmas. I read the reviews on this and forgot about the word, ""tablets."" These things are so BIG , so HARD and , although I am able to swallow them , pills make me feel sort of nauseated. Not small ones; just horse pills like these. I will have to throw these out and will buy CAPSULES instead.I have taken 6 of these, one pill twice a day for 3 days and today my knee feels SO MUCH BETTER. I will still stop taking them since last night I got the Doctors' Best CAPSULES. But I admit to being thrilled with the overnight , dramatic improvement (so far) with this knee. I attribute it to these horse pills and am hoping the capsules work as well."

Thinking it was either defective or they had to learn how to adapt to a new bottle, I gave them some time and added a water dish to supplement the water bottle. I don't know if the bottle ever worked properly, because about a week and a half later I came home to find that the bottle had leaked all over the cage. I tried to refill it a few times and it continued to leak. I even followed the BS troubleshooting instructions on Super Pet's website, instructing you to ""fill it all the way to provide the best suction"" and that didn't work either.I got scammed!"

20534,2,"I have an INSANE German Shepherd that paces, 'air snaps', whines and howls non-stop. Its beyond irratating. We will be flying him on a 14hr flight and I bought these pills to keep him from ripping his kennel to shreds and roaming the cargo bay of the plane. He ALWAYS tears out of his kennel and hurts himself severly...even with zip ties. Needless to say, at 2 pills nothing...still paces & bites the kids when they move. 3 pills he lays down occasionally when NOTHING in the house moves...but as soon as the kids move an inch he is up scratching, grunting and being annoying. I'm worried to increase the dose more. He is only 65lbs. But I'm thinking for the flight we will give him 5 pills. *shakes head*"
61442,2,"I have used the LitterMaid for many years, and, until recently, it was fine. Now, instead of 3 br, 2 bath house, with a garage or laundry room where I could put my noisy Littermaid, I live in a small 1 br, 1 bath apartment. The only place I could find to put my Littermaid was in my small bathroom. It takes up almost the entire wall between the door and the tub. And my bathroom is located in my bedroom area next to the walk-in closet. So, needless to say, my main complaint is THE NOISE of the unit. It's so loud, it sounds like it is next to my bed. Also, I've had to replace my Littermaid every 2-3 yrs. This time I bought the Elite Mega, hoping the ion air cleaner would help with the smell. Nope, doesn't work. Especially with Poop. In fact, sometimes I wonder if isn't blowing the smell out, because numerous times it has smelled like my cats have pooped somewhere else.Other complaints:1: My cats, I have 3, btw, all seem to like to dig to the very bottom. So, most of the time, I have to manually rake the litter off the tray, because the unit will hit the wet litter that wasn't able to clump, and there will be a loud clicking noise over and over again as the unit tries to rake up the mess. Then the rake stops and returns to the back of the unit and starts all over again. If I'm nearby, I have to run in, hit the on/off button to stop it, then rake up the litter. Not only that, but sometimes my cats will urinate on the litter and the rake, so the unit doesn't even work. At least 3 to 4 times a day I have to use the scoop to clean the litter from around the rake, then hit the on/off button. Of course, then there are little clumps left behind. I finally had to hunt down a special sifter scoop to get rid of these little clumps the rake doesn't pick up.2. As the receptacle fills up, it tends to separate from the unit, so there is space open to the floor below. At least once a week, I have to vacuum up at least 1 to 2 cups of litter that has fallen through the crack. And, with 3 cats, I have to empty the receptacle every 2 to 3 days. It's too expensive to replace the receptacle every 3 days, so I put a recyclable grocery bag in the receptacle, and it works fine. Still doesn't reduce the amount of litter underneath too much, but it's better. I just close the bag and discard it.3. The sleep timer doesn't work. It doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between am and pm. Twice I thought the unit was broken, the blue light and the power light kept blinking. Turns out the sleep timer had activated, but you can't turn it off. I had to wait almost 24 hours for the unit to start working again.4. I still have to dust buster my bathroom floor every day because litter still gets tracked and thrown all over, esp. if I try filling the box to the recommended level with litter. And, there isn't a litter brand out there that doesn't track. Trust me. I've tried them all. Oh, and the privacy tent lasted about 1 week before I tossed it. First, it tore at the metal bracing while I was trying to attach it to the unit. Then it covered the back of the unit where the on/off button and rake are, which became a pain when I had to remove it every time I needed to remove the rake to clean it.So, this leads me to the RAKE! YAY! It's removable. That's the only good thing about this unit. Otherwise, the rake sucks. The tongs are too far apart, so you have no choice but to use the very flimsy scoop that comes with. I tried. I still had the scoops from my older unit, and attempted to use them. Nope, they won't fit. The scoop that comes with this unit, has a tooth bent in the wrong direction now, and if I try to move it to the correct position, it will break off.So, there you have it. Don't waste your money. If you must have a Littermaid, buy one the older models. This one isn't worth the money. Or the aggravation."

81957,1,"Ok, I gave this 4 stars and I will tell you why. Yes, this is cruel for fish. However, sea monkeys can live so comfortably in it. So don't use this for fish who will only freak out and die because of lack of movement. For Sea monkies and microscopic protozoa, it's great. And better yet, It makes one hell of an ant farm and worm farm. And why not put it in your wall to breed maggots or bloodsuckers? I mean you might as well breed termites too. Watch them as they go from pupae to larvae to termite. Once they mature, they can eat through your walls making room for the new generation.This isn't what you had in mind? Why not use this as a septic tank in your wall. Everytime you flush, you can watch your chocolate corncobs and other 'boom-boom' you make float around and disipate into flavorful and colorful particles. Its like your own organic confetti. This aquarium is amazing for these types of things. I highly recommend it to any ignorant yupnut out there.

This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.EDIT/UPDATE: My oldest cat is turning 6 this year and my younger one will be 4 later this year. Both are still very healthy, active, and not overweight."
199585,1,My dog is half Lab and half GSP and has a Labrador's coat. This tool is very effective and my dog seems to like it. It is a bit messy as the teeth are unable to capture all the fur (it produces a lot of fur!). Also it has a static charge and afterward my dog gives me tiny shocks when I pet him. But he doesn't seem to notice and it is only immediately afterward. I have never used any other deshedding tool so I don't know how it compares but it is far better than just brushing and I am happy with my purchase.
5478,0,"i have not used long enough to know if it is helping, but i suspect it is. after receiving it i researched and found out it was an antibiotic. i do not like the idea of using an antibiotic without a doctors approval so will probably not use again. in any event, you have to use so much it would be way more expensive to continue than dealing with a few tear stains as it is strictly cosmetic and my dog is a pet, not a show dog."

129365,1,"NO DEAD FISH! That's always the first good thing when adding something new to an aquarium.I have been having horrible problems with ammonia in my 55 gallon tank. I have tried multiple solutions with little to no success ranging from partial water changes to chemicals. The HBH Aqua Pure Ammonia filter pad has done an excellent job. I still have slight traces of ammonia, but ammonia at .25 to .5 ppm of ammonia is a lot better than 4.0+ ppm.Just to fill you in, I have had this tank operating just fine for about 2 years. It was very well cycled. I do not use an RO system to filter the water, but I do filter the water to remove chloramines and other contaminants. The ammonia level in the filtered water is typically .5 ppm. Not great, but manageable. I typically do partial water changes of 10 to 15 gallons just to get rid of excess waste. But, recently and for some unknown reason, the ammonia started to spike. Same fish, so nothing has changed. I tested the water and it's the same. So, I don't have an explanation for the spike in ammonia.Other ammonia removers with partial water changes just were not doing the trick. This has been by far the best and easiest solution.Best of all the fish are healthy, eat well, and don't appear to have any problems.At some point I will probably invest in a good RO system to help with the elimination of ammonia completely."

Not only does it not slow him down at all (he literally gets that crap everywhere), because it's the crystal kind, t hurts really bad walking through the kitchen with bare feet and the litter is more noticeable. I have to sweep or use the hand vac all the time just to get the litter our of the floor so it doesn't look messy. I'm not thrilled with this product."

187536,0,"The concept of this carrier is fantastic - it has a base, like a child's car seat, that you strap into the car and then put the carrier into. I really like how stable this makes the carrier in the car, much better than sitting it on the seat or trying to buckle it in with the seatbelt directly. We've enjoyed snapping the carrier in and out of the car so easily, and sometimes just leave the base in for days or weeks when we will be moving our cats around a lot.But as with any innovative product, it takes a few iterations to get it all worked out. We've found three significant issues with the carrier: the door doesn't always stay latched, the round porthole up top is just inviting a cat to pop out, and the bottom of the carrier has several holes hidden under the included pad. The first two are manageable - check the door twice before taking the carrier outside (we've had a couple of surprises), and I saw at least one other person has duct-taped the porthole. I don't really think the carrier needs that porthole. The holes in the bottom were a much more horrible surprise. One of our cats relieved herself on the way back from the vet, and it went straight out of the carrier, though the base, and all over our upholstery. The carrier was nearly dry, while we had to pull out the car's back seat entirely and sop up urine underneath it. Disgusting, it took a while to get the smell of urine out of the seat and the car itself. I wouldn't expect any carrier to fully contain a big accident, but I also didn't expect the carrier to have several holes in the bottom to let it drain out! Pets have accidents, especially in stressful situation. We're looking into ways to plug up those holes to prevent any future issues."

71561,2,"My pup loves this item.But I was disappointed. The advertising is deceptive. The picture for the product shows two of the kneecaps and it is not shown in the packaging. It says that the items are 3-4 inches each. Farther down the page, it says that the item is 8 oz. It never says how many there are. The advertising implies that there are 2 kneecaps that are 3-4 inches each. Wrong! You get one kneecap for $6.00. Finally, the ad says that it weighs 8 oz, the package says 2.5 oz and the actual weight is 6 oz.I will not buy another Jones product for my animal and will be very cautious when purchasing anything from NYC Pet Supply and fulfilled by Amazon.You can buy Ranch Reward 5 pack for $9.99 ($1.99 ea) here at Amazon.

182719,0,"I got this thinking it would make lots of noises, but it really only makes one type of noise. You really have to shake the ball hard in order for it to make noise, so it's a toy you can shake to get your dog excited, but then when you set it down for them to play with it, it goes silent. If you're looking for a noisy toy to keep them entertained, this wouldn't be my choice.Pros:JW Toy (which are always innovative)very durableit's a ball (not sure what more I can say)Cons:it doesn't do much unless a person shakes itonly makes one noisenot super exciting"
162330,1,"I have 2 50-lb terrier mix doggies with lots of long wirey hair. No, it's not the best brush for removing hair (it does remove some) but the main reason I bought it was the claim of freshening your pet. And I find that it does a GREAT job of that. After I brush the dogs they smell fresh and clean. I recently bought a Furminator deshedding tool and that works GREAT to remove the excess hair. I highly recommend it. So after using the Furminator, I brush them with the ionic brush and they look and smell great. It does emit a very high-pitched tone that I couldn't hear until I held it right up to my ear. One dog didn't mind it in the least, the other ran away at first. So we brushed him awhile with it turned off, and while he was enjoying being brushed we were able to turn it on without scaring him away. We just brushed him lower on his back and not by his ears until he got used to the sound. After that, no problems at all. If this brush conks out I will DEFINITELY buy another one. It just does a wonderful job of making them smell fresh and clean."
78892,0,"I bought this for my 13lb Boston Terrier. She can pull with the best and instantly becomes a sled dog when fitted with a regular harness. I researched no-pull harnesses for days and decided on this one based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Now I have used the harness regularly for over a week, I cannot give it more than 3 stars - here's why:(1) Annoying to fit. I knew this before I bought it, but seriously, I spent a good hour trying to fit it just perfectly.(2) The straps get loose after you use it one to two times, so you have to refit the harness often.(3) The harness decreases pulling but does not make my dog walk like an angel by any means. (side note: we are going to puppy classes which has helped somewhat.) The first times she lunged at a couple other dogs, she fell on her face, flipped over, and kept tripping on the leash. While I suppose that could deter her from lunging, it was an unpleasant experience. The other dog owners were questioning why I was letting her be so destructive to herself, but I really had no control over it. She was in the zone where no amount of food or instruction would help. She does not pull to this extreme anymore, but she knows just how much she can pull without getting into that sort of trouble.(4) Probably the most disappointing of it all - CHAFFING. It was my fault that I continued to use the harness after I thought I noticed it was making her belly/armpits lose hair, but I honestly wasn't sure. She didn't seem to hurt or be bothered by the harness and she has pretty short, thin hair on her chest/armpits/belly. Then yesterday evening, after a number of long walks and going to puppy training class, I noticed she had quarter-sized raw areas under her armpits! I was horrified! This apparently is a common problem with this harness.I like that this harness did discourage lunging and pulling hard, as compared to my other traditional harness which seemed to encourage pulling... But the chaffing issue is still a problem. I'm toying with the idea of sewing sherpa or felt around the chest and armpit area to see if it helps, but I'm not betting on it."

10909,1,One of the few things I have bought that the ole hound seems to like the taste of...now thats a switch. The jury is still out and after a few days there is no problem having my best bud take em. Time will tell and will update accordingly. From all the natural things I have seen..garlic and for some reason that is no surprize.. I mean really.. who likes smelling garlic.. you really can't blame the bugs.. nobody I know likes to stay in a small area with a garlic eating thing...so that may be the whole point..apart from that..on the yeast deal I have noticed my dog seems to like beer a lot more...now when she hears a top pop she queues up for a swaller....friend or foe.***UPDATE*** 7/7/2012 After using this product for several weeks (after a good bath with Halo mixed with DeFlea) haven't seen more than one flea in a week.Prior to using this fleas have been a large problem to the point of distraction and even daily baths only held then off to the next day. Using this product has shown a marked improvement in control to the point of daily combing with a flea comb just to check and see has left me with the thought that this thing really works. My dog is rather small and only use 1 tablet daily broken in half at a time and to be honest I was astonished at the results. It seems that taken internally the tab exudes a scent that fleas would rather not be a part of with no noticeable odor on the dogs part to my human nose. All and all I highly reccomend this and as dogs have different metabolisms and what not it may not be a cure all for all dogs but it sure does work on my best pal.
10201,0,"My hamster lived in this cage pretty comfortably for two years. She seemed content with it, and I liked its expandability and flexibility. She was very excited moving from her tank to a big, spacious wire cage. I purchased some add-ons as well, which she loved. A cage with a lot of of interchangeable parts made it possible to switch up her environment from time to time and keep her entertained.But let me warn you: Cleaning this thing is a nightmare. You basically have to disassemble the entire thing just to dump the base. It never wants to come off smoothly or easily, because there are four different pieces of wall sliding in every direction. And putting it back together is no fun either. Every time you get something to lock into place, something ELSE slips. It is an endless cycle of frustration. Many foul words were uttered in the general direction of this cage.On top of all that, the roof of the cage doesn't really stay on-- it just sits kind of sits there awkwardly. I was afraid this was going to be an escape problem, but it never was... I'd be cautious, regardless, if you have a particularly ambitious hamster. My cage may have been manufactured incorrectly but the higher door on the cage wasn't actually accessible because the roof sits down in front of where it's supposed to open.The plastic is... iffy. I really wished they had used a softer, more flexible plastic instead of this brittle stuff. I broke a lot of little pieces off of the cage just trying to get things to come apart. There's really no way to pull off tubes without exerting HULK-SMASH amounts of force, so you end up Hulk-breaking-little-chips-off every once in a while. Most of the damage I did to the cage was superficial, but the latch and hinge on the top compartment gave up and broke. I had to order another one from SuperPet (which arrived in a very timely fashion) and duct tape the thing shut in the meantime, since I still needed it in place to keep the cage completely closed.All of my complaining aside, as I mentioned, my hamster really liked this cage. It's reasonably escape-proof (the hamster never got out on her own except through human error) without being owner-proof, it's roomy, it's kind of goofy and colorful, and the expandability and flexibility is really neat. Getting replacement parts for it is a cinch and super affordable. The base is deep enough that we didn't really have any trouble with bedding flying everywhere, and the rounded corners make it both easy to clean and more comfortable for the hamster to sleep in.It's a good cage, but it's not user-friendly."

67484,1,"When we ordered two of these window perches, we were not sure if our cat would like them, but figured it was worth a try. The perches came two days after we ordered them (fast shipping!) and each took about 4 minutes to install. We didn't ahve to cut any holes int he sill or drill anything to the wall, it was so easy. :-)Within minutes of the first perch's assembly, our cat spotted it connected to the kitchen window. He didnt know if he should jump up on it or not since it was only a few feet away fomr the table and we always freak out when he goes in the table, so my fiance picked him up and placed him on the perch. he immediately started to kneed the perch and purr loudly. He tried rolling over on it, but it isn't big enough for him to roll completely over on.Now, almost every evening when my fiance and I come home from work, we walk in to find our kitty fast alseep on his perch. We installed the second perch in our computer room, but only allow our cat to go in there when either my fiance or I am with him because the fish tank is in there. When one of us is in the computer room working, our cat hops right on that perch and settles down for a nice long nap."
154537,1,"I replaced my old, broken LitterMaid with a new Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter Box 2 months ago, and I've been really impressed with how well it works - it really is pretty much maintenance-free (aside from stiring around the crystals periodically). I think the motor is a little bit quieter than the LitterMaid, and it doesn't seem to get stuck the way the LitterMaid often did. The litter tray replacement cartridges are expensive and so far I have not seen them in any local stores so I order from Amazon (free shipping). Also, I change the litter tray more frequently than it says you have to. I think it says for one cat you can let it go a month - no way! I change mine about every 10-14 days.Surprisingly, my older cat adapted to the crystal litter right away, however my younger cat won't have anything to do with the new box. I tried all of the tips in the Scoop Free instruction book to entice her to try out the new box (mixing clumping sand litter in with the crystals, letting her regular litter box get really dirty so she's forced to try out the new (clean) box, etc.), but she's still not interested. I think she doesn't like the ""crunchy"" noise the crystals make when she steps into the box. Oh well - my older cat, who is very picky about having a clean litter box, loves it, so I'm happy with my purchase."

The little area to collect ants is well placed.So now comes spring and hummers we were excited to watch them and their new eating holes. We made no changes to the formula or any other item except the feeder itself. No hummers. Well, almost no hummers. A ruby red buzzed us several times at each location but would not feed. One day while putting one of last years feeders one actually sat on the feeder while I was emptying it into the plants. He fed and told me he did not like the new ones. Well, not really. But why would one hummer feed from the old and not from the new. Right now it is time to retire the new feeders and revert to the old. It is possible that the new has an odor in the plastic that the hummers do not like. I do not know. For now this has been a waste of money."

Even our tough-girl aussie has been cruelly hit by this purple meanie. I took a star off for that, only one because I think buying a smaller size squirrel than you think you need could solve the problem. The other star off is for the lack of interest both dogs have in getting treats out of the SD even though I've cut off one of the treat-holders. Other reviewers had good ideas about that I will try.

It lifts the poop out just fine, but that looooong and slow journey from the bottom of the conveyor to the receptacle is a stink!

166071,0,"Some background info about my pup: She tugs and pulls everywhere we go. It's like she doesn't even recognize me at the other end of the leash while at home she listens to everything I say. Sometimes she likes to make my life harder when she hops 4-5 ft instead of walking. She is a 45 lb labrador/hunting hound mix. When she sees squirrels, she gets into hunting position with her body low against the ground and walks like a lion about to catch its prey. She goes from an angle where the squirrel cannot see her. When she is 5 ft from the squirrel she will make such a prounce that it feels like my arm has been almost ripped out if I'm not careful. I still love her though.About the Product: This leash has done the job for casual walks. I will NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of retractable leash if I know we will be in an area where I want her to be close, controlled and safe next to me. I just don't trust my pup too far away on a thin leash like this (even if it is all belted) with her hyperactivity and strength. Any moving object will make her go crazy and she can EASILY snap a leash like this especially if she is 16 ft out since I have less control the farther she is. I use it only on night walks when I know there are not many squirrels or distracting things outside. She has her freedom to walk a little bit more on the grass and go to the bathroom. Other than that, for her exercise I will take her to a dog park, baseball field or by the waterfront near me on a sturdy 6 ft leash where I run along with her.I would recommend retractable leashes for small dogs (yorkies, chihuahuas, malteses, etc.) I would not recommend retractable leashes for hyper dogs (of any size really other than toy size) or large dogs especially if it's somewhere risky or not safe. This leash is great for casual walks where you want your dog to have some bit of freedom."
73986,0,"I tried this product but as a gel it is very difficult to administer as an oral care for my pet dog. It requires that it be refrigerated which makes the gel version a lot thicker. It may be better to use the oral liquid version which can be easily administered as a spray.The ads and the description indicate that within a month the plaque on my pets teeth will start to disappear. Although I have had the gel version for about two weeks now is too soon to say in terms of results. The gel, when applied, does not adhere to the teeth and either gets dispelled by my pet or he ""licks it up"" and swallows which prevents a direct application.I'm still optimistic that this is a better alternative than traditional veterinary methods of teeth cleaning which require, and at great safety risk, to have the pet anesthetized. There is always a risk that the pet may not survive this method which is why I chose the gel application.John, NYC"
32138,2,I purchased this in late 2011 because my 1 cat will only drink from the faucet. I figured this would be the fresh water effect I needed. I took completely apart at least 1x a week but rinsed it out every day. I scrubbed it and rinsed the filter as well. In May 2012 I noticed some brown fleks floating in the water. The filter was brand new...only used it for about 2 weeks. I pulled it out and it was completely covered in a brown sludge! I was disgusted!! Took it apart and even used a bottle brush to get into whatever areas I could. Again the fleks showed up...again washed it thoroughly. This happened several times. I noticed there is a narrow area that is very slim that nothing can fit in. Apparently it builds up a mold or something. I am so frustrated since I took it thoroughly apart every week and let it dry for almost 24 hrs before putting it back together again. I refuse to use it because now I am afraid my cats will get a bacteria from it. This is the 2nd one I purchased. The first one which I THOUGHT was great...except about a month after purchasing started noticing my floor was getting wet. I am so glad I didnt put it directly on the rug..but on a rubber mat underneath. The entire thing was leaking!! I would NOT recommend this.

There is no packaging between the filter box and the shipping box except the sheet of paper, and no padding inside the filter box whatsoever.

45514,0,"We bought the gentle leader based on favorable reviews from others who have used it. The head collar works great, but it has a couple flaws.First, there is little to secure the neck collar from getting loosened or reset. The only thing to secure the sizing of the neck collar is the latch itself, which can easily loosen or reset when the collar is not being worn. We find ourselves refitting the collar every other time we put it on.When the collar is worn, the excess portion of the collar will dangle with no place to secure it. We knotted it a couple times to reduce the length, otherwise it would disturb the pup. Most quality collars will use two points to secure the collar and secure the excess, but not the gentle leader.Second, the nose loop wears down bald spots on our dog's snout, just under his eyes. This is supposedly remedied with a deluxe version using felt, but Amazon does not appear to carry it."

1248,0,"These are really stinky. Not a problem as far as the dog is concerned; most dogs would be hard pressed to decide if they wanted to eat or roll in four day old road kill, after all. I, however, am thanking my lucky stars I have an airproof tin tub to store these treats in. The strips are also irregularly sized and shaped. Again, the dog doesn't seem to mind, but, given the smell, I would prefer not to have to poke thru the bag looking for a large piece when I want to keep the dog occupied for a while. I assume the dog would give these a five star rating; I give them only a three."
119944,0,"For some strange reason, my Betta didn't like this food. It was difficult for it to at least try it, but spitted out immediately!I feed him with Bloodworms (by Tetra), and he loves it. My guess is that my betta is so very custom to worms that he doesn't wanna try anything else. So I guess it would unfair to actually rate this product. That's why I give 3 stars, no bad nor good...!"
93520,0,"If you are a dog or cat owner trying to find a bulb that puts out enough heat to keep a small box warm, this isn't it. I expected to find a bulb that put out more heat than a standard 40 watt incandescent but it doesn't. The ceramic ""bulbs"" work much better and 40 watt will likely be too small anyway. Go at least 60 for smallish boxes and use the light cover to direct the heat."
75300,0,I was some what disappointed in this product. It does the job but it constantly is pulling apart on the top and my dog gets out when this happens. I would have rather purchased something else that cost more money and can ensure my puppy will not escape when I am not home.

This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope.

He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage."
215925,2,"The eye of the hanger is to closed I have to tip the feeder up sideways to slide the eye of the hanger over the the shepherds hook, spilling the nectar out. None of my hummbird feeders has this problem. So I tried to hang it empty then fill it, which is just about impossible to hold it still so to not spill the nectar and snap the top on. The feeder does not hang level. I can only fill it about half way because the nectar runs to one side and then out if it is too full. I put an orange half in the center, skewered on the hanger, and filled the ant moat with grape jelly and had my first oriole visit the next day. I didn't even bother trying to test the tabs that supposedly will hold orange slices/quarters. I just don't get how they are supposed to hold the orange pieces securely. The orioles love the oranges and jelly but either don't know there's nectar in it or can't figure out how to get to the nectar. The orioles continue to visit the hummingbird feeders, and will even hang upside down trying to get to the nectar they can see but cannot reach. But no funny antics with this oriole feeder. After a week, I removed the nectar port covers and finally they are taking the nectar from the oriole feeder, but now there are large openings allowing what not to get in and spoil the nectar."

65594,1,"This crate is heavy. While the construction allows for easy portability, its weight does not. I purchased it for home use and am very pleased. The pewter color is a darker gray than I expected, but a nice color.The box had been dropped in shipping so we needed pliers to unbend the points of impact to complete assembly of the crate. Other dog owners have admired the three door access that offers more flexibility as to where the crate can be located in the house and have access to a door to open.Our new pup settled in quickly. The adjustable inner divider works to resize the crate for a pup for now. The enclosed DVD offers helpful tips about crate training. Our pup loved the crate once we placed it in a corner and covered the top and three sides so it is more den like."

My wife and I hoped that this would be the answer, but she did not show any signs of hearing anything. She completely ignores it. I also thought I could use it, along with voice commands, to stop her barking in our back yard, but that also did not work. From other reviews, it sounds as if it has worked for other people, it just did not for us."

We kept it on her and it stays on her pretty good. She's a pretty active dog and our other Jack keeps trying to steal it. Anyway, I recommend it if you can find it for about 15 bucks. It'll stay pretty good if you get the right size. Mags is about 20 lbs and is a parson jack russell terrier. We use the medium for her. Fits pretty good.Good luck"
176706,0,"I love this product and so does Jake, my 8 month old GSD. He will play with this for a long time! Just about every toy I buy him he destroys except this and his everlasting treat ball (which I highly recommend). The only negative is I wish I bought a larger ball WITHOUT the handle....it's the only place where Jake is beginning to ""chew"" and eventually I will have to cut the handle off. My next one will definitely be the 14"" with out the handle. Well worth the money!"
19894,0,"The Petsafe wireless fence system is ideal for my family. However, Petsafe knows that they have us over a barrel. The system is a simple transmitter/receiver setup but is has been made unnecessarily expensive. The system is not cheap, however, the fact that any additional collars are at a minimum of $120 and the batteries, that you will need to change every 6 weeks or so, are expensive - and exclusive, of course.This is a wonderful alternative to having to fence in your yard to contain your pet, but you need to realize that it is an ongoing, not insignificant expense. I will be glad when Petsafe has some competition out there and are forced to bring their product more reasonably priced."
82510,0,Delivery was very quick!! I was surprised and impressed that it came in 3 days even though I ordered regular shipping.I was disappointed that the kennel wiring was bent on one side and the side door was not aligned right so it is difficult and tricky to close the side door. I originally ordered a smaller midwest crate and I received it in great condition but my dog outgrew it so I ordered this bigger one. The size is great but it does look like it may have been returned by someone and then sent to me. In this I was disappointed but I had already thrown the box away since it was torn anyway so I did not bother with the hassel of returning the crate. Had the box been in good condition I would have returned the crate for one in new condition.I do like the Midwest crates and was very happy with the smaller one I had purchased previously but I am not so happy with the condition this bigger one was in when I received it.
54060,0,"I thought this did what it said it would; my cat's stinky breath was less stinky after he lapped up some of this in his water bowl. However, my cat didn't seem to like the taste or smell of this, and soon avoided his water bowl. I stopped putting it in his bowl because cats drink little water as it is, so I didn't want him to stop altogether. I can't say I blame him; I didn't taste it (obviously) but the smell was a bit musty to my thinking. Maybe I just got a bad bottle."
108700,0,"I read a review that this scatmat would have holes in the corners to secure it with suction cups. My scatmat is the large 48 x 20 but has no suction cups or holes. When I called the company, they said the newer models don't have those. I used plastic clips on the edges, attached string to them and secured it to the surface so it wouldn't fall off after the cats flip it over as they leap away.It seems to work well, since the cats haven't gone onto this outdoor surface and damaged anything like before. Since the cats are feral and neighbor cats that are ruining things around my place, I don't know what actually happens when they have tried, since I just haven't seen their attempts. At least there is no damage, but the flipped over mat that was obviously jumped on may have done the trick. I give this 3 stars, since it must have worked, but didn't have the feature to keep the mat in place. I may use velcro on the edges. After a week and a half the batteries are still good, but might get the electric adaptor."
85074,1,"All of you with long haired dogs, this is a MUST HAVE. Got mine today and it is amazing. It doesn't rip the hair out like others. I had a carpet of Great Pyrenees undercoat, plus I was covered after just 15 minutes. It took out the matted hair and everything but gently. Nice product!"
97795,1,"I bought this product for my 1 year old German Shorthaired Pointer. She is approximately 50 lbs. I followed the included directions as best as I could and I have used this product for 6 months with no complaints. The best feature is the adjustable field strength, which allows you to adjust the width of the signal (which I keep at a very low setting). If you crank up the field strength, it can become incredibly wide, and I'll sometimes crank it up for a half second to give my dog a shock if she's at the perimeter barking at somebody walking by.The way it works is it will give a small warning beep as your dog approaches the perimeter. If the dog continues to get closer, she gets shocked. I noticed that sometimes the distance between the warning tone and the shock can be quite small, or even non-existant, so the dog receives a shock without the warning. No worries though, because eventually your dog learns where she can and can't go.It's very important to follow the included directions and train your dog properly for about 30 minutes a day for about a week, unless your dog is dumb, then spend more time on her. This way, your dog knows what to do if she hears the warning tones or gets shocked. Otherwise you risk your dog getting scared by the shock and running straight through the perimeter.Three things I'd like to note: 1: I have used this product for about 6 months with the included battery and the battery is still good! 2: I tried the shock on my arm and it's pretty strong. I wouldn't use this product if your dog weighs less than 25 lbs. 3: Sometimes I let my dog out without the collar now, because she now knows where her perimeter is."

143149,0,I have been using Litter Maid Litter Boxes since they first made an appearance on the market....in the middle 90's. I have had more than one Litter Maid at a time as I have had 2 cats. The new Litter Maid LM900 Mega I purchased is for a new cat. It hangs up when the rake is at the tray end starting the return cycle. The cats will not use it when the rake is at the dumping end of the litter box. The unit has to be taken a part to clean the debris away from the contacts on the dumping end. Sometimes the younger cat jumps at the bar and hits the stop bar causing it to lock up. I had to return one model that hung up and it would not release. This exchanged item has the same problem. I don't know if it is the model or a overall poor design. The small brush did not come with this model as is indicated in the list of parts that were included with the Litter Maid.Means More Work...

109485,2,I have been looking and looking for a strong squeeky toy for my Jack Russell and this is not it. He loved them even though he de-squeeked the first one in a few hrs. The second and third took only moments. He still likes to chase the ball for a few minutes before he's bored.
58493,0,"There are 2 design issues with this toy: 1. in order for the rope to go back in, it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope, but a flexible one. 2. When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to ""work"" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal. So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized."
33091,1,"My sweet and gentle dog was the worst puller EVER when I got him on a leash! I had even taken him to training classes which worked wonders for sit/stay/down and the like, but he was still awful about pulling on the leash. The moment I put this collar on him, he became a model citizen. I've rarely even had to utilize the quick tug approach. Just having it on is enough! He was pretty scared of it at first, but over a month later, he is used to it enough to not be scared but to still obey."

The balls came in a package of 2 and upon trying to open one of the balls to put the treats in, the plastic broke. So, I filled the 2nd one and it took her about 5 minutes to get all the treats out. I think she enjoyed it though, so will continue to use it. Any little challenge is better than none for this smart kitty. Why do they make cat toys out of such cheezy materials?"

The clasp is too small, there's not a lot of heft in it and when I tried to clip it on my puppy's collar (and with my puppy squirming and turning his head every time), it would not clasp easily. So, even though the leash is good as far as standing up to the chewing, I have a problem with the clasp. It needs to be bigger and more substantial. I have since gotten another leash."

It took him only a few days to destroy one of the parts though. And now it is up with all the other toys he has destroyed. We will be trying a Kong next and see how that goes. If you have a heavy chewer, this is not the toy for your dog but if not, would be a great toy."

188547,1,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

61356,2,"Litter Maid's auto litter box is terrible. I wrote about the Scoop Free at the bottom. I used the Litter Maid for a month to give it a fair chance. There are gaps on the side of the litter box, close to the disposal cartridge and litter just falls through on to your floor each time the rake pushes the litter towards the disposal cartridge. The worse thing is the part where the tray that holds the litter meets the part that holds the disposal cartridge. When the rake pushes the poop up and out of the litter into the cartridge it leaves (over time) ""streaks"" on the plastic because the poop is drug across the plastic in to the cartridge. A lot of the time when the rake pushes poop/clumps to the disposal cartridge it hits this edge and the poop/clumps get pushed in to the rake instead of going over the edge in to the disposal cartridge. Then they usually stay stuck in the rake until you knock them loose. Sometimes the poop stops at the edge, the rake goes over it and then the poop ends up behind the rake when it goes back to its starting point. Sometimes the clumps break up and you're left with bits of stinky litter in the box instead of the disposal cartridge. This is why it stinks so much after a week.I got the Scoop Free by Fresh Step and it's wonderful. My cat had a hard time with the new crystal litter and looked at it funny for 6 weeks. He peed in the floor once and my husband's gym bag once. He just didn't like the new litter. The Ultra unit has a counter which counts each time he uses the box. I would check it when I came home from work and when I got up in the morning to see if he'd used it. If he hadn't, I'd pick him up and put him in front of it over and over until he used it. I also used a motion sensor camera that I hooked up to my laptop so I could see what time he used it. This litter is harder and smells different than the clay he's used to. I learned to sprinkle the clay litter on top every few days until he was completely used to the crystal stuff. The clay litter won't damage anything and the only problem with it is it gets stuck in the rake. Now he's used to the litter and uses the box with no problem. The reason I feel this unit works so much better is because the rake pushes everything in a straight line instead of up and over like the Litter Maid. The litter doesn't clump so nothing gets stuck in the rake. The crystals also do a great job of absorbing the smell of urine. There's no smell from the box when I walk in the room. I do have a sofa beside it and I can smell it a little if I sit on the end right beside it. It's my 2nd TV room so I'm only in there when my husband is using the other TV so I can easily sit on the end that's further away from the box."
31269,1,"This works PERFECT. I can't believe how cheap this is. They could charge double for this dog collar. I use it for my 42 pound boxer, and it could not be more perfect. She is the darling of the neighborhood as she garners ALL the attention in her new collar. You can see this VERY well in the dark and from quite a distance away.My wife and I are avid campers, and I initially started rigging glow tubes and small LEDs for my dog's collar so she could see (and we could see her) while she explored the campgrounds at night. This item lets us see her perfectly, and in combination with the PUP light (which lets her see), she is in doggie paradise...GREAT PRODUCT. BUY TWO!"
196728,2,"We had an absolutely terrible experience with this product! We have three dogs, only one of them is a problem barker. She hates odd sounds (howls when someone plays a musical instrument, etc.) so we thought this would be a natural deterrent for her. First, I inserted the battery and tested the device; it emitted a high-pitched squeal (sort of like electronic feedback) and immediately, all three dogs started barking frantically. Not a good omen. But I figured I would try it out anyway. I put it on her, stuck close, and of course she didn't bark... About 45 minutes later, one of the other two dogs hurt her foot and yipped. It set off the squeal in the collar (even though she wasn't the dog that made the sound) -- and pandemonium broke out. All three dogs went berserk; they literally attacked each other, and I had a three-way dogfight on my hands, right in our dining room. I lifted the smaller dogs off the big one -- none are really small, they are 40 pounds and the big one is 70! -- and managed to drag them into the bathroom, where I was able to get the collar off the poor girl who had the misfortune to be wearing it. This was NOT the end of our problems, though. Our big dog (she is a black Lab) is a little phobic and afraid of other dogs to begin with. She essentially panicked, and then stayed in panic mode, pacing and shaking all over, and generally looking like a poster-child for schizophrenia! By mid-afternoon on the day after the incident, we were concerned that she might actually have been physically hurt, so we took her to the vet, who did x-rays. Nothing physical -- it was what we'd thought, a mental problem brought on by the fight and that stinkin' collar! We've had $160 worth of vet bills, she is now taking Reconcile (a canine version of Prozac), and we are patiently retraining her to trust the other dogs in the family. She is doing better; however any shrill ""squeak"" (such as tennis shoes on the kitchen floor) will cause her to cry out and start to shiver. In summary, if you love you dog(s), do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this product! It has been an absolute nightmare, I wouldn't wish it upon anyone..."

11669,0,"I read the reviews before purchase so I was pretty familiar with the product. Once we figured out how to set the timer, it's been a GODSEND for that 5AM feed where the cats were previously banging on our door. We have some pretty smart cats but they don't try to break into the feeder. The sound of the motor is noticeable, but only if you're in the area when it goes off. I like that I can pop the lid, put the food in, and put the whole thing back together without having to reset the timer. I just wish they made a curious toddler proof clear cover. ;) The only improvement, IMO would be a digital timer, but the product does what I need it to do. I can sleep in and it's FANTASTIC!Edit to add: The dishes are still going strong almost a year later, the cats don't break in and the motors haven't been chewing batteries. However, if you need spare parts, don't bother asking. Our child took the plastic cover off the motor and when I inquired about JUST that part, I was told they don't sell it and I would need to return the whole dish. After some back and forth I decided to just live with it, but it's annoying that they don't sell replacements for easily removed parts of their dish. We use it almost daily so sending it back would be a real hassle. Dish OK. Customer service...not so much."
100109,2,Just a warning...I purchased my Fishmate 2000 Pressure Filter from Foster-Smith on 5/2008 and it busted open leaking water from the side 5/2012.

145088,1,"We recently adopted a cute little kitten and she's been well behaved for the most part, doesn't scratch furniture or bite humans etc.But unfortunately, she LOVES chewing on stuff. We give her plastic straws which she likes, but she seems to prefer very expensive electronic equipment wires.She's so far caused the untimely demise of : 1 Razer mouse, 2 headphones, 2 Wii sensor bars, and a Webcam.Yikes! Staggering amount of money lost and destruction by 1 kitty cat. Sadly, we love her too much to get rid of her so Bitter Apple SAVED our lives and sanity.I usually spray some on my hands and apply it to the wires in the house a once every month or so and so far we have had almost no other problems with her. Most of my electronics are happily safe and cat teeth free.The product says it's specifically for Dogs, but it works well enough for our kitty cat so hopefully that goes for other cats as well.Thank GOODNESS for Bitter Apple. Reasonably priced and very easy to use (I mean it's a spray how hard can it be lol)"
28458,0,"I have a Boston Terrier, who likes to chew, but won't just chew on anything. After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months. Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there. So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an ""ok"" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners. Please keep this in mind before buying!"
15504,1,"I'm a trainer who was skeptical as to whether this rather low-priced collar would be effective on a German Shepherd, but I'm pleased!My dogs aren't nuisance barkers, but are territorial and didn't like getting a new neighbor & sharing our fence with his dog. I bought one collar for my female - the 'lead' barker. After just a few zaps from 'God', she got the idea and no longer barks. The gradual correction levels give her warning enough that she sometimes still gets off a bark or two before pushing her luck. and she's still able to whine a grumble a bit without getting corrected.MOST IMPRESSIVE is the fact that the collar somehow wound up in a cooler at our Christmas party, submerged in water for about 3 days before it was found. It still worked perfectly!I'm getting a second collar now for my male, who has decided to take over where the female left off. While I still have some additional problem solving to do to keep them from running at the fence with the neighbor dog, this collar at least keeps it quiet and less aggressive.I don't believe this type of collar will solve every barking problem, but for my target issue, I'm pleased."
78357,1,"My dog got a pair of pink Doggles last winter after I realized the K9 Optix style wasn't going to fit her wide muzzle. At first she dragged her face on the pavement...then pawed at them...then gave in to the notion that if she pulled them off, I would put them back on. She likes to put her head out of the window (what dog doesn't?) on bye bye rides...the Doggles keep her from getting corneal abrasions from minute debris that flies through the air. This year, I got her a pair of the Chrome Doggles so they would match more items in her wardrobe. If you put the Doggles on a little bit at a time, the dog will get used to them. My dog does therapy work and her ""glasses"" always seem to brighten up the day of the patients she visits."
114256,1,We have three cats and millions of fleas. Tried a lot of things. But every morning I would get up and fleas would jump on my feet - really creeped me out.

15136,1,"'PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark Collar' worked so well for my dog! I have a dachshund appropriately named Boomer and his bark is peircing to the ears and he would bark at everything. Finally after 4 and 1/2 years of listening to him bark histerically at every sound I broke down and bought this bark collar. I was skeptical at first because we had tried one of those high-pitched sound emitters and it trained me more than it trained my dog. I also didn't want the collar to harm my dog, but I found that all I had to do was put the collar on him once and the first time he barked it shocked him and he immediately stopped. Now I don't even need to put the battery in the collar. Just putting it on him makes him stop barking and sometimes I simply just have to show Boomer the collar and he'll stop. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has a dog that won't stop barking."

182896,0,"I bought a Mega the year they came out (99?) and had 5 cats at the time. It outlived three of the cats. It was a workhorse and I LOVED it. Unfortunately the quality seems to have gone down.I bought a regular size for my Mother this spring and it is always getting stuck and -yes we have tried every litter under the sun including Littermaid's own. It is still better than scooping multiple times a day, but it isn't the labor saver my original was.My workhorse finally died last week, so I gambled and bought a new Mega. It works but not nearly as well. The rake doesn't reach down as far as my original and it tends to leave a layer of unscooped clump on the bottom. I'm going to try the silcon spray, but think that it just isn't as well made as they used to be. I'll give it one more week and then return it and try a new one if the performance doesn't improve."
179567,1,My cat loves sleeping in the hottest place she can find. This bed warms up as opposed to heats up. I won't plug it in if she does not want to sleep in it and she won't sleep in it unless it has been plugged in. I am also afraid that I will forget to unplug it. Maybe I should put it on a timer switch. Anyway be aware that this bed is not intended to be hot and if you have a pet that is attracted to something that is hot then you will be disappointed when she leaves for the hot air register. I can't say that I am dissatisfied with it but I do wish it was slightly warmer to the touch. I know my cat wishes it was alot warmer to the touch.

84255,2,"I purchased this last year for a boxer puppy we were housebreaking. I kept the kennel in the garage so she wasn't exposed to direct wind, but boxers have no cold tolerance so she just needed something to keep warm. She was rarely ever in it since someone is almost always home, but it only took her about 5 or 6 times in the kennel to chew the wire to the point where it doesn't work (and remember, she's a puppy). The coil is very loosly wound around the cord and there is nothing keeping it tight against the end where the wire goes in to the pad. It took her nothing to move the coil enough to get the wire. I am just glad she didn't shock herself. I was going to return it for a refund, but my husband threw the box away so it just became more of a hassle than anything. I wish someone would make a dog kennel with a heated bottom. Would have solved all my problems. Wouldn't spend the money unless you KNOW FOR SURE your dog won't try to chew the wire."

207610,0,1st I must say. Some if not most of zoomeds items like this basking dock is made with a paint-like substance that peels off into my clean turtle tank...I'm unsure how safe it it or if its lead ..if so then lawsuits can follow if someone's pet dies due to swallowing this...I don't know but I'm tired of scooping up the partials that comes from this item. Maybe its foam dunked in paint but ZooMed need to create something more safer than this coating. And it was gritty coming out of the box so I rinsed it off and it still has particles that float into my clean water.If this didn't happen it would b great...My turtle likes to climb on it but he has to get used to it after using another bank made differently.

84667,0,"Knowing that my cat will be fed regardless of whether or not I make it home is a huge weight off my shoulders. She wasn't scared of the sound at all, and took to it right away. We've had the feeder for about a month now, and she comes flying across the apartment when she hears the whirring sound. I gave it 3 stars for a few reasons. #1, somehow the clock is a tiny bit off and has slowly shifted earlier and earlier, so that it's now going off 5 minutes before the time I originally set it for. #2, the bowl is kinda huge for my cat who has to practically climb inside to get the kibble on the far side. And #3, For some reason I couldn't set the feeder to give my cat lunch at 12:00pm... it doesn't like noon!! That could just be my inability to figure it out, though. Also, I'm not entirely sure that the portion is exactly 1/4 a cup, and for a cat on a diet, that's pretty important. BUT, despite all of the minor problems, I'm very happy with the purchase."

36115,0,"My experience with the product (used on 3 dogs of various breeds and personalities) was a mixed success. Without question it discourages pulling on the leash, and definitely made walks much easier in all 3 cases. Controlling a dog is definitely easier with the Gentle Leader, and it is very easy to slip on once you get the hang of it.We worked with a very good trainer for 2 of the 3 dogs, and each dog was desensitized to the Gentle Leader by trainer.However there were issues with all 3 dogs -1) Each dog commonly will stop its walk and try to ""paw"" the gentle leader off of its nose. This happens on average once per walk, and no amount of correction seems to stop future ""protests."" Indeed I do not believe the dogs enjoy wearing them.2) The piece which attaches to the leash hangs down so that a dog can chew on it. I have one lab mix which becomes aggressive when he sees another dog or cat while on a walk (and yes we are working on this issue). The lab mix turns his aggression on the Gentle Leader and chews on it HARD. We had a close call recently where he literally chewed all the way through the connection while we were walking him. Luckily I caught on quicker than he did, and was able to attach the leash conventionally to his collar before he bolted after a neighbor's cat.3) Our smallest dog is a 16 lb Chiweenie. He seems to shut down with the Gentle Leader and is more likely to cease walking altogether when wearing it, than he would be otherwise.At this point, we feel like the Gentle Leader helped us with our dogs' walks but also may have provoked some unwanted aggression and protest. We are currently looking for an alternative, and are considering Illusion collars (or something similar) as we are not comfortable with pinch/choke chains."

We did not upgrade to the thicker wire, but did take precautions in areas where the fence would be regulary driven over (put the wire inside a plastic tube, then inside the ""trench"". It has been about 4 weeks, and no issues yet. The instructions on training were very detailed, however did not work for our dogs. Once our skittish terrier got zapped while on the leash, she was over it, and just layed down, wouldn't walk anymore. So, we had the flags up, and let them go - we had to inrease the range to about 7 and have only had a few instances of getting through, but they are getting used to where the fence is, and are now able to be unsupervised. GREAT investment, they are so much happier now!!"

Also, there was suposed to be a fully loaded crytal box when I ordered it, but it was missing the crytals and I had to buy a box to put in it in order to use it. Also, the refill boxes are so expensive. I really do not think I would buy this again. Also, if you buy it to use and leave the cats alone, what would happen if the electricity goes out?"

As for the snap on combs - they seem a bit odd to me - double sided but the clipper blade isn't - maybe I'm not totally understanding the method of use - but I've used comb extensions many times - just don't understand these.

95296,0,"We like these collars a lot, mostly because the cats don't seem to be bothered by them nearly as much...and therefore don't pull them off. We've had one successful removal, but that's a huge improvement over every other model we've tried. There is one significant problem: the metal ""sliders"" can easily move if the cat tugs on the collar. This expands the collar more and more, until it's drooping off the cat. It's billed as a safety feature, but I don't see it that way. Our solution was simply to 'tighten' the metal sliders in a vice once we'd gotten the collar to the perfect length. The breakaway clasp still works, but now the collar stays one length. I suppose a second option would be to tie a knot outside the slider as well.Overall I recommend the product since it has worked better than anything else."

It seems to last longer, and I have now ordered several despite the fact the price has gone up considerably. Oh, and the cat loves it! It's perfect for those &#34;well fed&#34; kitties."
123315,1,"I initially bought these pellets for my pleco, but soon found that all my fish favor this food the most. I had bala sharks, angel fish, tiger barbs, a blue gourami, a pleco, and an occassional beta. They all went for these pellets first. Only the frozen bait cubes are favored over these pellets.After a water heater malfunction, that boiled all my fish (arrrghhh), I began again with african cichlids. Initially the cichlids went for the cichlid pellets. As they grew, they now eat the shrimp pellets first, and then the cichlid food.I would highly recommend these pellets for most community tanks, plecos, or african cichlids."

Gabe sheds when he's sleeping and it had gotten to the point he was going to be shaved & my little Pugs pretty enough without adding to it. Furminator was easy and shock as it may be-it felt good to him as I was I was ""furminating"" him."
4733,0,"After spending > $70 to get two small dogs groomed each time I visit a major Pet Market, I decided to get clippers to do the job myself. Though I'm still trying to get the hang of clipping areas like joints, around the ears, face, etc, the clipper is fairly easy to use. It's quiet. I like it...but my dogs to a lesser degree when I'm cutting around the face.The major issue with this clipper is that it gets very warm after 10-15 minutes of use. Fortunately, the plastic thingamajig that goes over the metal keeps it from burning the dogs. The metal gets hot to the touch.Other than that, it's quite a neat little clipper."

I use a Petrodex toothbrush to brush my dog's teeth each and every night, and the result has improved his health and dramatically reduced the number of times for which his teeth have needed to be professionally cleaned."
58005,0,"I got the medium/large toy and it is really big. I have two large dogs and only one of them can carry this around. It is definitely a tough toy, but my dogs only play with it when there are treats inside. Then they get the treats out and don't touch it again until I put more treats in it. I thought they would chew on it even when no treats were inside because they always want plastic bottles which I don't like them to have. Overall, this toy is durable and a good toy if your dog will play with it."

90176,0,"It's difficult to keep the litter box clean because this type of litter doesn't clump. The urine has to be almost completely dry before it can be scooped out. I've ended up mixing this with some traditional littler & it works better.On the positive side, it's so much more environmentally friendly. It doesn't have that nasty chemical smell or dust when you pour it into the litter box. It's lighter too - so it's much easier to change out."
162263,0,"Our 4 pound dachshund loved this toy at first, but as soon as the smell wears off the chews then she wants nothing to do with it. However it does seem well built, and is easy to use. Mostly just to expensive to keep loaded with chews if your dog only likes new smells or eats them quickly."
144489,2,"Although attractive, this horrible product trapped a tiny little chickadee as it tried to perch on the stand (I ground-mounted it). We discovered him after he had nearly pecked his own leg off trying to escape. I was able to free him by prying the bars of the mounting stand apart, all the while scaring the poor creature closer to death, and he was finally able to fly off where I'm certain he will die, either from trauma or an infection. I'm terribly disappointed with this product. Please be aware of this awful flaw and don't use the stand to mount the bowl."

54860,0,"These bags work great as long as they were perforated well from the manufacturer and the seal that keeps the bag together holds up. Sometimes the perforation would not be cut well so it would cause the next bag to rip open at the bottom because I was not able to tear along the perforation cleanly due to the poor cut. Also, sometimes the seal that keeps the bag closed on the bottom wasn't there so after opening the bag to pick up my dog's poop I find out I couldn't pick it up with the bag because it went right through. Started using another brand that was cheaper and had no quality issues like this one. Search for the bags from dogwastebags.com on Amazon. I've been using those for the past year without any issues. If Dogipot can fix the quality issues and price, then this would be a great bag as it's the right size as not to waste a whole grocery bag and they're also bio-degradable."

7359,1,"A great solution for keeping tracking, smell, and appearance to a minimum, as many have said. I only want to add that my cat took awhile to adjust.The details: I followed the instructions to leave the top off at first, and she used it; then top on, and she used it once then wouldn't go in again (I had a backup box in the basement, which she would have to share with her dreaded fellow feline if too fearful of new box. I knew she preferred her privacy, but I also wanted to be sure no unfortunate habits would result from too much fear of the new box, i.e., accidents in the bedroom, location of her box and preferred domain). I then left the top off for a few weeks; box ignored, then used. Top on, top off. Finally I just left it on, and now it has become her go-to box. Took a few weeks, but well worth it. Now I am buying one for the second cat in his preferred quarters. He's a climb-into guy, so I anticipate early success."
15210,1,"I placed the collar on my springer spaniel one evening. He barked 2x and then all was quiet for the next week. This is after weeks of constant, almost non-stop barking at night.

201661,1,This is a great tool for combating shedding and keep your house less furry! My dog sheds all year round and with this tool I believe that there is less floating hair around the house. I have tried slicker type brushes and my dog hates them because it pulls his fur so he tries to run away which makes it impossible for me to brush him entirely. With the FURminator it doesn't seem to pull the tangles and makes it easier for me to finish. I love it! Definately recommend it for those hard to brush dogs.

116637,0,"I bought this with the Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, since it was recommended that they go together. I have two papillons - one loved the toy and was quite good at getting the treats out of the bottle rather quickly...while the other one waited and consumed what fell out.That being said, they consumed a fair amount of the treats. Not a lot, but a good handful. Since the product was recommended to go with the toy, I had assumed that it would be okay for them to have more than just one or two of these. The next day, when it was Potty Time, I noticed that their #2's were bright green, and a little ""loose"" (sorry for being so graphic). My dogs don't eat table scraps or any people food - I feed them Science Diet puppy bites, with occasional training treats, and this is the first time I've ever noticed a problem with their BMs.They seem to like the taste of these, though they prefer others. I would recommend mixing them with some other treats rather than using them consistently, or you'll be cleaning it up later. I will probably continue mixing these in with other treats/kibble until I use up the bag, but will not purchase anymore in the future."
145751,0,This is a good sized food contained and held a large bag of dog food from the store. My one concern with it was that the handle cracked just by light use. I would consider getting it again because of the price but dont expect it to hold up through heavy use.

Now our bun has figured out how to open it by himself, though. And it's not only that he can open it, but he is able to do it with ONE well-placed little bite. The lid opens in less than a second of him trying and isn't even a challenge. So while this was a great idea, the manufacturers didn't take into account that a pet will try to break into it eventually."

418,0,"We ordered the turtle, other cuz, and chicken at the same time. Our dog, a voracious chewer, loves these toys. The rubber is strong and resistant, but allows her to get a real chew feeling. However, Rosie excels at chewing off any appendage on her toys and immediately got the little feet off, then on the third day managed to decapitate the turtle. She likes the remaining ball, but she liked it more when it was a more odd shape. For $5 I'm ok that it didn't last too long, but I'm not likely to order the turtle again."

The large one, though, she absolutely shredded within minutes of us giving it to her. The ball looked more like flat, partially unwound DNA.This toy is perfectly fine for dogs that don't chew aggressively, but my dog has actually destroyed Kongs before. And she's only 17 pounds!"

115239,0,"We have two 90 pound dogs and it felt like we were filling their water bowl every 4 hours. I love the 3 gallon capacity, and now we refill the water every 4-5 days which is great. My complaint, though, is that it is cheaply made and very hard to line the threads up to put the top back on. We wrestle with it for several minutes every time and we never know how it will line up in relation to putting it back in the container. If its off a little, its very hard to open the top to let the water out.I love that the water lasts 4-5 days. If it didn't, this would be returned because of the hassle with the top every time."

We no longer use this product because after placing an order and immediately realizing that the ship to address was wrong, the customer service was not able to change that order to the correct shipping.

31816,0,"This is our second Pet Gear stroller. We bought this one as a replacement to a smaller version.We like the size of this stroller and it fits our two cats with ease. This stroller is also significantly lighter than the smaller stroller it replaced which is a plus.The problem is the front wheels. Pet Gear has gone to a double front wheel on this model stroller which our first thought was great, this ought to steer even easier the the stroller it replaced. Not so. These wheels are very grabby and will shudder periodically while pushing it down a sidwalk or steet.I don't know if others have had the same experience with the front wheels, but hopefully Pet Gear is working on a redesigned front wheel that eliminates the grabbing. We are going to contact Pet Gear to see if there is a replacement wheel they will send us.Had we not experinced this problem, I would have given the stroller 5 stars."

21031,2,"Our 9 year old black Labrador, who since his neutering years ago, has been afflicted with involuntary dribbling of urine. He has been treated, and examined over, and over again throughout the years, with little to no resolution of the urine leakage. We turned to using the Simple Solution Washable Male Wraps on Mike while he is in the house - otherwise we had urine dribbles everywhere, which got old, and the constant cleanup was tedious.When we first bought the Simple Solution Wraps, they were sewn of, cotton, or a cotton blend, blue (both light and dark) denim with a soft flannel lining to which we add absorbent cloths or pads to soak up the urine dribbles. We generally have 3-4 of these, size Large, Wraps on hand. We change and wash them daily, or as they get wet. The Wraps don't last forever with the numerous washings we subject them to (we air dry them), but long enough to make the cost of them totally worthwhile. Eventually, the hemmed elastic around the edges of the Wrap gets old and loosens somewhat, but not until after many, many washings.Our most recent purchase of a Large Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap was totally disappointing. The outer material is no longer a nice soft denim, but is made of a slippery synthetic material. The inner lining is no longer the soft flannel as stated in the product description, but a very shiny and slick nylon fabric. The result is a wrap that slides easily and does not stay in place very well. The removable pads that we place inside the wrap do not stay put very well. The sizing is different. The new Large is larger than the old Large, and does not fit our Lab nearly as well. The new Wrap slides around, and in our opinion, the new fabric is really unattractive to boot.Had we known that the Simple Solution Wraps were going to change so dramatically in quality we would have bought a lifetime's worth before they changed the fabrics. Now we're stuck with the new (and improved?...not) version. We won't buy the Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap in its present incarnationSimple Solution Washable Male Wrap, Largeagain, and we'll be on the lookout for alternatives."

There's a 'lip' just inside the fill hole so the last few pieces of kibble often get trapped but it's a fun game for me to shake them out. For my pup, this is a great activity toy. Well worth a try!"

It was COVERED in these tiny creepy crawlies. They are so small, you can barely see them, until there are millions, then you can't miss them. And their rate of reproduction is crazy!!

110141,0,I have a five month old bullmastiff puppy and she likes to cuddle in her crate with her puppy blanket so I thought adding this bed would give her a nice bolster to rest her head on and soften the crate bottom to prevent any calluses on her elbows. It is a nice collar and is soft to the touch but the center area is very thin and doesn't really provide any padding. She still digs her blanket into a nest in one corner but I think the bolster has helped her prop her head a bit since she is snoring less. This bed would not stand up to any chewing of the bolster and slides a bit so if your puppy or dog is very rambunctious or chews a lot this probably would not work for you. I wouldn't return it but I probably would not buy the same one again- I would get a thicker square dog bed instead if you are looking for a soft padding for the crate.

If I had an engineering degree, I would make one out of wood or metal or hard plastic, not recycled sandwich baggies.
