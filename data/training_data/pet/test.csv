148316,2,This is a waste of time and money and doesn't work at all. My dog sniffed it and then walked away and peed somewhere else. Don't waste your time with this product.
191169,0,"Drinkwell - or whoever owns the company now - just lost a customer due to poor customer service.The bowl cracked at the hole for the pump, as others have reported in their reviews. I probably had it for about two years.Their web site says to call them and have this information: the pump brand and the manufacture date.[vetventures.com]""My fountain is leaking, what do I do?If the fountain still leaks, remove the motor again and inspect the bottom of the bowl for any hairline fractures...*Please have the following ready when you call: Brand of motor (Askoll or Resun), Manufacture date of fountain (located on bottom of bowl).""Me: Hi, I have a Big Dog Fountain that is cracked at the hole for the pump.CS: There's a one year warranty. When did you buy the fountain? There's a one year warranty.Me: I don't remember, but the date on the bottom of the bowl is 3/10.CS: That is the date it was manufactured in China, so that wouldn't be the date you bought it. There's a one year warranty.Me: Uh, yes, of course, but I said that I didn't know when I bought it, so I'm just mentioning the manufacturing date.CS: There's a one year warranty.Me: I thought I might buy the part.CS: That part is not available.Me: Bye.It was hard to clean, but good when it worked. Started leaking about a month ago. Convenient, but very expensive for the length of time it lasted. I just ordered a Pioneer Fountain Big Max - Stainless Steel.P.S. I should mention that I read a review by NursePink (Misery) (""Good results & customer service, October 27, 2012"") who had the same problem. She had a happier and more helpful outcome. I was pretty shocked at the CS rep's attitude. NursePink got in touch via email; I guess I should have emailed my complaint, too!"
146333,0,"Previous to this purchase, I was using a human hair clipeer on my labradoodle. It worked great for about 5 or 6 haircuts, then it jammed up. I did some research and decided on this model...seemed like it had decent reviews and a decent price. I've used it once on my dog. My first impression is that I'm not very impressed. I don't feel like it cut as cleanly as my old clipper. I went over and over the same area, but it still seemed to leave ""tracks"". After I was done I took the blade off, as instructed, to clean it out. It was easy to remove, but for the life of me, I couldn't get that blade back on the clipper. Frustrated, I put everything away with the blade stuck in the box. I will have to enlist a more technical helper to get the blade back on before the next cut. I will give it another try, but I'm left wondering if the cheaper brand at the big box pet stores would do just as well or better. To be continued..."
157487,2,"It came and it looks just like the picture, but i think only certain stocky, short-haired, long neck dogs would really look right in it. I cannot use it at all. It seems larger than sized, also. It reminds me more of a piece of armor than a harness jacket, heavy and stiff, but on certain dogs it may look just fine,maybe like a Jack Russell. I wanted something softer, smaller and more adjustable."
32498,1,"I bought the Original Drinkwell fountain about 9 or 10 years ago in hopes my cat would drink more water. Actually, I bought the PetMate drinking fountain first because it was cheaper than the Drinkwell and I figured they were basically the same. NO, they are not! As another reviewer mentioned, the water stream in the PetMate just runs down the front of the unit and does not provide an actual *fountain* so it's essentially a really expensive water bowl that happens to have water sliding into it. My cat didn't drink any more water than he usually did so I donated the PetMate to my mom and purchased the Drinkwell Original.It was hands down the best pet purchase ever. I noticed immediately that my cat loved the fountain and started drinking a lot more water. The first fountain lasted about 2 years and would have lasted longer had I realized you could take it apart (yeah, I know, I should have read the instructions in better detail). It just stopped working one day and I figured the motor died so I tossed it and immediately bought another one. This time I read the instructions in better detail and realized all I should have done before was take the thing apart and clean it fully (rather than clean the unit as a whole). It would have lasted me years longer. The second unit lasted 6+ years and died today. I made sure and cleaned it thoroughly just in case. I'm ordering the Platinum version this time (just to try it out) but wanted to give a review for the Original since it's done such a great job all these years.PROS:* My cat and dog love drinking water from this fountain, so much so that if they stay with anyone else it's hard to get them to drink from a stagnant water dish unless they are really, really thirsty. I've noticed that when other dogs come over to visit they drink substantially more water than they do in their own homes, forcing their owners to buy a fountain, too. :)* It's quiet and easy to refill. I travel a lot so I ended up buying the additional reservoir since pet sitters would forget to refill the bowl, thus aiding in the burning out of the motor when the water level got too low.* It's easy to take apart and put back together to cleanCONS:* It's not the most fun to clean, however. As another reviewer mentioned, there are some weird nooks and crannies that don't seem to be necessary for the product to work but make it hard to clean when you get cat hair and slimy goo inside the unit. It only takes about 10 minutes to clean but you DO NEED either the cleaning kit or a bottle brush. I bought a fish tank brush since my local pet store didn't carry the cleaning kit and it works fine, although I could use a smaller, thinner brush for the harder-to-reach areas.That's the only 'con' I can think of. It's really a fantastic product for both dogs and cats. I highly, highly recommend it."
74420,1,The gates are a convenient way of closing off a room. nice to just open gate and walk through. Had to make a small modification for a narrower opening.
70824,1,"Have been using the Pondmaster Ultra Violet Water Clarifier in my pond for about five years, with good results. Decided to replace the entire unit instead of just the bulb this time. This is much better than using chemicals to control the algae."
93600,0,"This is a great product and it has made walking my Dane SO much easier .... BUT .... the reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 is that it's a HUGE pain in the butt to get on and off. Had I known this I would probably not have bought it. If he sat nice for me it wouldn't be so difficult but then again, if he sat nice I wouldn't need it. LOL"
76940,0,"This pen is not suited for highly active puppies/dogs. I have a Shih tsu/toy poodle mixed puppy and he is very energetic. If your dog is like mine, you will come home to find that the pen is no longer where you left it. My dog jumps and leans on the railings and easily shifts the pen from its original position. I always come home to find the pen is in a different place/position--not where I originally left it and mind you we are talking about a four month old puppy! I also come home to the added bonus of having to clean up the mess of his food and water bowl having spilled everywhere due to the moving of the pen. The pen literally needs to be pinned between two objects so that my dog is not able to move it. I think that if the railings of the pen were made out of a heavier plastic/material, it would be perfect. This pen definitely needs some tweeking before I recommend it. Aside from this issue, the pen is adequate. The size itself is okay, enough to fit a bowl of food, water, pee-pee pad and a few chew toys. The latched door is very convenient and the pen itself is easily assembled. Overall, I say it's a good investment if you have a tiny dog; definitely not recommended for mine!"
61912,1,"This stroller is wonderful. It is easy to open, close, and has a good steering radius. I LOVE that there are two small straps inside that hook onto my dogs harness. My beagle has learned quickly that she can't leap out. What would have made the stroller perfect would have been for the inside of the stroller to be a few inches longer. My dog can't stretch out and has to lay curled up a bit. Also the basket under the stroller is a bit hard to get at. It is perfect for a dog bowl and a bottle of water. It will not be convient for personal items, as would be a child's stroller.On the whole I would absolutely tell a friend to buy this stroller."
126938,1,"My puppy really loves this toy. I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews.I'd call him a heavy chewer, but he has not ripped the bone apart, and we've had it for a few weeks. He's little though (4 months old, 5.5 lbs) so maybe that's why.It's true that the bone doesn't stay frozen for very long. He likes it even after it's begun to thaw, though. He likes it when it's frozen, and he likes it when it's not frozen but cold and wet.Also, to the person who complained that the plastic bag broke: it's just a Ziploc bag. They're not supposed to last forever, and you can easily get another one.Many of the reviewers on here suggested using a frozen washcloth instead. I'm hesitant to do that because I don't want him to learn that it's ok to chew on towels.Bottom line: my puppy loves this toy, so I do too."
27302,0,"I received this and it didn't have a cover for it. There was no mention of a top coming with it, but with the price as much as it was, I just assumed it came with all the extras. I returned the aquarium and got a full refund."
195155,1,"We bought two of these for my dogs, and it works great. They aren't to thick, they don't sit wrong on the dogs neck, and in general we love them."
85082,2,"The Lunge Buster is a good idea for the Buddy System (or any leash that you are going to attach to yourself or a bike, for that matter). However, when we received ours and tried it out, it broke on the first lunge. It feels like there is a bungee cord attached to a small ring on the inside, but the ring is now not connected to anything and the bungee is only attached at one end. Until they start making these with a little more emphasis on quality control, I would avoid them. Save yourself some money, go to Home Depot or Lowes, and buy some bungee cord and a couple of connectors - you can probably make the equivalent of the Lunge Buster for under $8. The rest of the Buddy System is fine (so far), but the Lunge Buster is a definite bust!"
160363,0,Hydor heaters are overpriced and overrated. This one lasted a while but I still feel the product is pretty average and not worth the extra expense.
189775,0,"Hi,My cat Denver liked and didn't like the Merrick Gourmet food. But I'm glad I went to Amazon, because the price was much better than anywhere else.Thanks for being there and I know I will be shopping at Amazon again in the near future.Deborah Tinsley"
69722,0,"This worked pretty well for a while, but then my dog, who is a rather spirited barker and has a stubborn streak, got used to it. I expect it could work quite well with some dogs. For the price, worth a try."
107120,0,"I've been a house rabbit owner for seven years. I learned everything I know from the House Rabbit Society, my vet and of course the bunnies themselves.What I learned first and foremost is the ingredient missing from this rabbit kit is something they need 24/7 - timothy hay. Since most rabbits are two months or older when purchased, hay is a must. Oxboy is the best. Also, pellets need to be fresh - how long has this kit been sitting there?And store bought snacks made for rabbits - garbage. Read up on them at the House Rabbit Society and check out the healthy snack recipes, vegetables and fruits as well as the quanity's which are safe for your bunny.And store bought cages are not big enough, even the hutches. They need a place where they can stretch out, play, run, and do their binkies when they have to be shut in. Make your own. Mine is 2 feet wide, 4 feet high, split into two levels with a landing and ramp. The top is hinged for easy access; the bottom has a door so he can come in and out at will and is wide enough to remove the litter box for cleaning and for cleaning the floor which is vinyl covered plywood. I used 4' steel corner posts and mesh wire, along three sides of the bottom is plexi-glass. The floors and top sit on a 2x2 frame with a lengthwise support in the middle and it sits on casters for easy movability. Well worth the time and expense."
23696,2,"I put the dog food into the bowl and the dog pushed it out while eating. Even when I put a small amount into the bowl he easily pushes it out. The dog is a pug, thus he must push a lot to get to the food. I bought the bowl to help with clean up because I get tired of cleaning up the extra food he pushes out. I wanted a bowl the dog could not push his food out of. This bowl does not stop the food from being pushed out. I Wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Do NOT buy.AD2"
134784,0,"I have been looking for a backpack type carrier that would fit my 15 inch long (from back of neck to tail) 10 pound Dachshund mix. My purpose was to use it when I go hiking if he gets tired. This was not a good choice. He was too long which made him hunch over in the carrier no matter how tight I made it. His back legs didn't fit well in the leg holes because they were too short. He also didn't look too comfortable in it. Looking at it with him in it I would imagine it probably was stressful for his back.So even though the product's length is 15 inches, I would estimate that for a dog to fit well in it they should be around 11-13 inches long. If you have a Dachshund that is 15 inches from head to tail or longer, do not get this.I did try the carrier on my mother's Chihuahua mix and she fit perfectly. She didn't seem to like it though.This carrier looks way more ridiculous once you put it on. So I'm opting to buy the Doggone Device Backpack Carrier. My hopes are up that it will be long enough for my dachshund."
189162,0,"Its a well made car seat for a small dog, but it does tend to retain heat as it is covered with synthetic fleece over a spongy foam core. It is easy to remove the fleece from the core for washing purposes, but is a tight fit when trying to replace the fleece covering over the foam core after even having run the dryer on low... it didn't appear to have shrunk- just a tight fit to start with."
189587,0,"Even the small size is a bit big for a regular size cat (and even for my larger 14lb maine coon mix). The velcro allows you to close it tighter, but if your cat is determined to get it off, they will push it off their head with their back paws in seconds (like mine did). That said, it's nice and light and good quality, but I am only able to use it on my tamer cat, or under constant supervision, which kind of defeats the purpose.Would be great for dogs since the velcro would be much stronger if its whole surface was used while closed."
166341,0,"Reasonably priced, but the fit is rather tight, really have to press down hard to make them fit but then they do. Can overlook that because they were rather cheap."
116326,0,"Product works as well as anything, using it in the bathroom. I have not tried it for other uses. Most ofthese types of deodorizers are fairly expensive--though they may last longer? (They're certainlypreferable to &#34;household&#34; sprays & other obnoxious scents)."

202016,2,"Ok, so I've never written a review on ANYTHING before...this is my first. We have a 6 month old boxer pup and have used the Furminator for a few weeks now...I gave it an honest shot and now I'm done! It makes my pups coat look thinner and unhealthy (looks like its making gaps in the coat)...it actually broke the skin in one place making it bleed a little. And he hasn't enjoyed it from day one. And he still sheds just as much as he did before use. I wouldn't recommend it."
160457,0,"I've used this stroller several times to carry two or three small Yorkies to outdoor events and still have room to hold my purse and a water bottle or two. I like the wagon style and that it doesn't look like a baby stroller. My dogs can see out well. The frame and fabric are well made and it's easy to set up and collapse.It does have a couple flaws. The handle is too short for comfort - and I'm only 5'3"". I ended up buying a baby stroller extension handle for it. Also, I have trouble with the carrier not staying attached to the frame. It's designed so you can use the carrier separately, which I've never used, but it could use a better design to keep it in place when you're pushing the stroller."
23093,0,"First, I have three cats and this only works well one one of them. The cat it works on has a heavier, coarse coat. The others have softer, longer coats.The product works well but if over used it can cause bald spots. This is what happened with me. I liked it, I used it and then found bald spots.I know use it every month once and then switch to my traditional tool. (Slicker brush)."
185101,1,works great to keep the cats warm so they are not all on the bed trying to sleep with me.
42666,0,"I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine."
19342,0,"I posted 2 photos of how the 10"" long one looks inside of a 10 Gal tank. Way too big. I didn't really think about how large it would be. It doesn't really bubble the whole thing for me, just the top part. It won't stay flat, it keeps flipping backwards like you see in the photos. I don't have any fish at the moment, but I plan on getting a small bubbler. Maybe a cool ornament one. Probably would look great in a much larger tank."
40244,0,"Rolling the box back and forth to collect clumps in the handheld tray is a great idea, but the rest of the design could use some work.The biggest problem is the mechanism to secure the top and bottom halves together. Twice the plastic clips have broken off from weight being pushed back and forth all the time. The grooves between the two halves also quickly collect litter until they no longer fit securely. The result is more and more litter leaking out of the edges. Some solutions might be stronger clips, more clips, and/or rubber gaskets between the halves. A tight fit would make this thing perfect. After buying a new box or taking one apart for a thorough cleaning, we run packaging tape all the way around to hold it together more tightly, which helps a lot.Unfortunately they haven't updated the design in a while, and we're on our third or fourth box after the previous ones have broken in various ways."
93815,1,The product came as specified on the website. It works wonderfully and I would order this product again because of the price and durability.
96274,0,"Even as small as this is, my gerbils are not able to move it. It didn't take much to crack it out, but that is most likely from my kids being ruff. But the price was pretty good."
148550,0,I only gave these pads 3 stars because they are just average. Based on others reviews I expected something different than all the other pads I've used (as far as dryness goes). Not so. They are also a little on the small side. I highly recommend the pads that Costco carries in their warehouse (not always in stock) over these.
80971,2,I have bought egg babies before for my dogs. The dogs love them and will play with them for hours. Beware of the eggs on the platypus. My Boxer puppy almost swallowed one of the eggs whole. It was very fortunate that she was able to cough it out. The eggs used to be larger. I was very disappointed in this toy and threw the eggs out.
181358,0,"This seemed like a great bed to put in the dog house for the cold winter months. But two days after we placed it into the dog house, it had been torn to shreds by our enthusiastic puppy (7 months old) who thankfully was NOT electrocuted. I wish I would have ordered a hard kennel mat but now that I'm out the money, I think the puppy is going to have to wait for awhile. I gave the item 3 stars because I don't think it's the products fault for the puppy chewing it up, but maybe the material could be more tear resistant?"
215477,1,Excellent dog shampoo. Lathers well and does not leave that awful wet dog smell that you find with other dog shampoos.
195160,1,"this is any regular choke chain. it tightens when the dog tries to walk away from you and loosens when he comes back. My only complain is that the 3mm 22"" is a TAD bit small for our 60lb lab. It wont fit anymore if he grows any bigger, and I'm sure he will."
101024,2,"Used 2 bottles thus far on a pee soiled rug from our dog. It has done nothing so far. The fine print of the bottle says to allow drying for 2 weeks by the way. Guess those enzymes have to take their time! Well, it's been 2 weeks after our first application and we have had no change to the odor. We are going to apply 2 more bottles just for the fun of it.They offer a money back guarantee, so, if they actually send me my money back I will rate them much higher. Await my update to this review about if I actually get any money back or not!"
192373,0,"I have a very smart, often bored Australian Shepherd. She's about 40 pounds and I'd consider her a moderate chewer. She's not really destructive, but if she wants something bad enough, she makes it hers. We affectionately call this her ""puppy crack dispenser"". She brings it to us to fill up when she's finished the discs and she's PUSHY about it. To say she's addicted is putting it mildly. It keeps her attention for an hour or so at a time, which is a godsend. Right there, it makes this purchase worth it for us. As a matter of fact, we've just bought our second one. Which brings me to the bad...In no way is this an everlasting sort of toy, not in the ball part and not in the disc part. The first one we got her lasted for about 3 months of HARD use which really isn't bad considering the abuse it's gone through. We've replaced it now that little bits of blue plastic have started coming off and now that she can pry the discs out way too easily. Just as it started to get easier to put them in, due to use, it meant it took her WAY less time to get them out. The refills are just too expensive for three hours of entertainment when it would take her a couple of days to pry them free when the ball is new.Also, the slits in the middle to insert smaller treats open too wide to make it much of a challenge for my girl to empty it, so we skip that part.Overall, the fact we've replaced this toy when it started to wear speaks volumes. She loves it and we love anything that keeps her happy and distracted from her velcro-like tendency to stick to us when we're trying to cook or putter around the house."
193818,0,"I initially got this toy as a way to satisfy the natural chewing instinct in my two guinea pigs. However, to my dismay, they figured out how to tear the thing apart in approximately 2 hours. They were not interested in the walnut at all, and were unwilling to play with the toy after it was torn apart. I ended up throwing it away. :( I'm giving this toy three stars due to the fact that other reviews suggest that this may be a good toy for other critters such as rabbits and chinchillas, but I would not recommend this to anyone who owns pigs."
200022,1,"I've seen these for sale in pet stores for upwards of $60-$80! I think those versions may have had a little doohickey that pushes the fur out of the comb, but I think that's a bit unnecessary. I have a black lab with thick coarse fur, and this thing does a great job of keeping it under control. I give him a good brushing with it once a week and it has significantly reduced the amount of fur shed around the house."
74297,1,"My husband did not want me to buy this. Now that it is installed, he feels differently. I managed to break some inexpensive pressure gates because I had to remove the whole thing each time I needed to get into the room. Sometimes we would just leave the old gates off because they were too much trouble to put on and off. Consequently our puppy would get in and chew computer wires (even when we used bitter spray.)I did not want to install screws into the walls. This item manages to be a pressure gate that opens easily without the need to detatch the whole thing. It only took a few minutes to install. The adjustable feet enabled us to install it low even though we have moulding. Many other gates to not accomadate moulding unless you install it above the moulding. The door on this unit easy to open--unusual in a pressure gate. There is a bar across the bottom that keeps the pressure gate fixed on the door even when you open the gate. The opening latch works easily.I anticipate that the cat door will be a great feature, but I cannot use it yet. Our puppy, now 20 pounds, is able to get through it. However he is just barely able to get through. Since he will probably grow to 45-55 pounds, I expect that he will not always be able to get through the small door. One he is a little bigger, we will be able to allow our cats to use the cat door. At present, we have the cat door screwed closed. It is good that you can decide to have the cat door screwed open or closed. If it did not have the screw closed option, the door would not keep our puppy out.This was definitely worth the money. Having been through several less expensive gates, I think that this is the best pet door yet."

Perching birds -- those that figure out how to do it -- get into the bowl, ""bathe"" in the seeds, and leave behind unwelcome calling cards. Clinging birds have trouble gaining purchase on the holes provided. They'll grab a seed or two and head off for a ""restaurant"" with better service. I like many Droll Yankee products, but how this one made it to market baffles me."

Well first my dog hates the taste and i am not seeing any results after having her on it for almost a month. For my doggie issues this product just doesnt work :(. Ill stick with the Dinovite and would suggest to anyone out there, if they are having the same issues as my doggie- cronic ear infections, constant licking and scratching,excessive shedding, to give Dinovite a try!"
80275,0,"We have a lhasa apso mix and it only works on him when he isn't over the top with his barking! I am assuming that whatever reange this sonic tone that comes out just can't overcome all the adrenalin pumping thru his body when he is overly excited just, particularly when we are in the car. When it comes to him just hearing something in the entry way of our apartment and he barks a few times, then it works. Basically if you want this item to work, you better own an average hyperactive dog, not an above average. Ours is way above average, I guess a bark collar is the only fix for this."

Do not get this kennel if you have a pug because it is way, way to small. But it is a good product, I like petmate kennels and this one is a solid 5 stars. however, this is getting 3 in this review so that you don't make the same mistake i did and get this expecting a taller kennel. look on petmate's website for kennel cab medium for a real picture. I went out and got a intermediate size petmate kennel from a brick and mortar store after this fiasco. minus two stars for having to return this."
189872,2,"I had similar experiences to other folks who rightly gave this company's products bad reviews (both the pH and Ammonia meters).With the first pH Alert I purchased, the reading never changed during the six months I had it in the tank. Fortunately, I regularly test with other kits and found that my pH was indeed fluctuating, despite the stubborn insistence of this product.The best that I can tell is that it gives a reasonably accurate reading on the initial use, but it fails, on all accounts, to ""Detect pH Shifts Anytime"" (their words).Don't waste your time with this--spend a few extra bucks and get test strips or, even better, a test tube kit."
151172,2,Poor quality in this brand. The links dont go together smoothly and ive actually had this collar pop off of my dog a few times. I looked upi better made prongs and came across Herm Sprenger. They seem to be top of the line. WOrth then money and much happier with it!

143275,0,"This is my first self cleaning Litterbox, I've had it for well over a year now.. most of the time it works well enough, I have two cats and get four days at the best without manual scooping.However, there are some quirks to be aware of:1. It tends to jam up sometimes, worst of this is when the scoop moves back and forth indefinately. This happens when it cant get back its home position! It gets jammed at the back. You have to intervene manually to fix the problem. Sometimes I'd had to even remove some litter to get it working properly again.2. Its messy when changing the containers, however much better than doing it the old fashion way.3. Clean-up is a real headache, as you have to take it apart to wash the tray properly.4. Way underpowered, it cant lift the feces very well into the container.5. Too noisy, I live in an apartments and have to turn the volume up just to hear the tv. However, my cats are used to it and they seem bothered.Overall, I would recommend it to the alternative, having no self-cleaning box.. it definatly makes my life easier since I can normally leave it unattended for a 2-3 days."

151992,0,"I got this thinking I could take my dog out to go potty without having to worry about leashing her. The problem is the built in ""control"" isn't long/elastic enough for me to grab standing upright without my dog hanging and choking from the collar. The only way this collar works with the ""control"" is: 1) if you have a very tall dog (i.e. Marmaduke) 2) if you are shorter than 4' tall. Otherwise when you use the built in ""control"" you will end up lifting your dog up and choking her."

136242,1,I moved into a new apartment and got brand new furniture. At our old place we always allowed the cat to come up on the couches and he had a bad habit of scratching all of our furniture. So when we moved into our new place we thought we would try these out while we trained him to use a post. They were easy to put on (with a little patience). I basically had to follow my cat around the house for about 45 minutes to put them on one at a time while keeping him interested in being around me by using his favourite toy.7 weeks later they are still on. I got my cat theSmartCat Ultimate Scratching Postand trained him on it using treats which I tucked away in the seams of the post. He now only uses the scratching post and we no longer need the soft claws. We have actually been waiting for them to fall off and they still haven't. They really worked well as a damage control device for that transitional period during which we were training our cat to use the post and not the furniture. I would recommend these as a temporary fix to protect your furniture while you train your cat.Update: After going through 2 packets of these my cat is completely trained to theSmartCat Ultimate Scratching Postand no longer needs the Soft Claws! Yay.

1965,0,My dog goes balistic every time she sees a squirrel so I got her this for Christmas. She just looked at it like it was stupid and went on. It was not enough squirrel like for her I guess. The sound that it makes though entertained my 3 year old cousin though for hours.

49272,0,"This toy comes with a way to hang it from a chain and supposedly a way to fasten it to the cage. The inner section is rotated but I don't see any way a bird can rotate that when it's hanging.I say this is supposedly designed to hang on the cage which is the only way I can see a bird rotating the center, but I don't see any way it can actually mount to the cage. There is a picture on Amazon of it mounted to the cage, but it only shows the front. If you go here [...] they have a short video with it mounted to the bars. Unfortunately there are only 2 screws included, you need 4) and the screws that come with the toy are too short. A trip to the hardware store should take care of that.Apparently Amazon doesn't allow urls in reviews. So if you go to Caitec dot com and do a search on Zig Zag you'll find the item. There's a video in the description."
103959,2,"I cannot rate this product since my cat simply refused to drink the water mixture. I followed the directions of water to solution, and even tried diluting it even more so.

I purchased the 8 oz size, and sure am glad I didn't buy the gallon size!"
169650,0,My 10 year old 24 lb. tom cat played with this about 30 minutes.Now he walks by it and doesn't even sniff at it.Then again he is not very play full.I would recommend the Sojos Catnip it's cheap and he goes a little Bananas over it.
19272,1,"A winner! The quality is far above what I imagined - the wood and connectors/fasteners are solid, no flaws, and the gate works perfectly. We're using one across our front porch entry and another at the side steps to the garden, so our german shepherd dog can be on the porch and the fence serves as a visual barrier that keeps her content (she could jump or barrel through if she chose, but the solid nature of the fence serves as a psychological barrier as well as literal one). We ordered the 108-inch fences so that when they are spanning the 72-inch openings the ""diamonds"" between the wood slats are relatively small and the height of the expanded fence is greater - again, for that visual barrier idea. Installation was easy - but be sure to follow directions on how to measure the opening and where to put the brackets, so it opens smoothly and is at the right height. I explored several other gate and fence type options, but they were either much more costly or more awkward to open. The latch on these is very strong yet simple to operate. Highly recommend this product."
153543,0,"We have been paying $16 for 12 pig ears at a local store for our dogs, which is about $1.25 per ear. This pig ears from the local store are huge though. Now, I bought these Beefeater pig ears off of Amazon, 25 for $22. At this price, I paid about 88 cents per pig ear. I guess I got what I paid for. Unfortunately, these Beefeater pig ears are tiny compared to what we were getting! They are about 2 inches by 3 inches....it only occupies my dog for about three minutes. So, I will not be ordering these again."

28937,0,"After bringing home our Three month old from a no kill shelter we gave him this toy. He was not interested, unless a family member had interacted.He's now around 1 year of age, and is slightly into it. It is one of the few toys from his earlier puppy days.The keys have fallen off the ring, which is understandable. It does make a mess, the torn off plastic like pieces, which could hurt if stood on."
21225,0,"These were a great idea...in theory. We followed all the directions exactly, clipping just a bit of our cat's nails off so they were still long enough to adhere these. After the clipping and the gluing, she was definitely fed up with us and wanted to be left alone. I filled all the caps with a bit of glue before applying any of them like the directions say to do, and that made it a lot easier to get them on quickly. That was a relief because the cat was so distressed, I felt bad. After they were all on, we distracted her with toys so she wouldn't mess with them too much, and she did try to lick/bite them some but mostly they didn't seem to bother her that much. That being said...a few days later I'd find them around the house here and there. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why some came off and others didn't, and while it was a relief to know our furniture was safe for a little while (a couple days), they didn't stay on long enough to really help the situation."
143291,2,"Please notice that the cat has to step over it feces, because the litter is dragged towards the front of the machine. How hard would it have been to design it so the litter was pushed to the back if the unit instead? Terrible to clean, god help you if you happen to ""let it go"" a bit, which is the very idea behind this loser. We do have two big rural cats, A 12 and 20 pounder, & they are hard on any litter box set up, but really, this thing is a terrible design, poorly executed..."
33882,1,"I have a 4"" one that my shiba inu sleeps on top of so nobody can get it. She loves playing with it. I also have a 9"" one that my miniature horse plays with. He spends hours everyday, swinging the ball with the rope in his mouth. He also throws it in his water bucket, on top of his shed roof and over the fence. He tries to give it to other horses to play with, but they aren't as enthusiastic about it as he is. The ball is rugged hard plastic that even a horse can't break. The ropes are thick and long lasting. My only complaint is that the horse can untie the knots on the ends of the ropes, so I wish it was a little longer so I could double up that knot."
178204,1,"i love this cat box! it keeps everything covered and smelling fresh with the charcoal filter. however, my only problem with this is that the liner keeps coming out of the one clasp after my cat uses it so i have to continue to adjust it every now and again. overall though, i am highly satisfied with my purchase!"

94670,2,"We've got a small beagle mix who just loves to go outside and bark from our patio at any neighbor she can see. I bought this collar hoping it might ease her up to charging out the door and barking. And well, it has. Within the first day or two, we could see noticeable change in her barking, even when we didn't have the collar on. I thought the battery life was fine (as some other reviewers made me fear I'd need a new battery every week) and amount of spray provided was adequate. My only problem with the collar as that the snap cracked, and broke within two weeks. As it turns out, both the beagle mix, and/or her MUCH more docile sister, decided to treat the collar like a toy once the snap gave way. Once the snap gave way, the collar became a toy. It never stood a chance at that point.Not happy with the build of the collar itself. It has hopefully changed the dog's behavior, but with only having it on for two weeks, I'm not hopeful the behavior change will stick.Also, not happy with Amazon on this one. I understand not being able to ship the item back due to the citronella spray can. However, a little warning would be nice. I've now got a $40 worthless hunk of plastic hanging across some threads of what used to be a collar, and there's nothing I can do. Quick! Someone spray me in the face with some citronella!UPDATE - 1/30/2012So, out of desperation, we purchased another one of these. This time, there was one small difference with the collar. This time the collar came ""pre-strung"". We didn't have to put the collar onto the device. And I have to say, my biggest problem with this collar is gone. The snap on this collar is substantially better. We've had the new collar for a couple months and so far, so good. It's doing its job with the dog, and it's holding up on its own."
36142,0,"This product came very highly recommended and after careful desensitizing we were able to use them on two of our dogs. They walk nicely individually but when together pulling was a problem. It did help lessen the pulling but the number of times this tool was confused with a muzzle just broke our hearts...people saw only the straps, not the friendly well-behaved dog inside it. When you own a breed endlessly maligned in the media and largely misunderstood you find yourself doing everything you can to avoid further mistaken negativity.Instead, we just started back at zero and re-taught proper walking with another dog just as we had when she was by herself.The dog we continued using the headcollar with did fine but not when we tried to transition to a martingale collar when he grew out of the Gentle Leader. Without the Head Collar, all bets were off and he acted as if he didn't know any leash manners at all! So we had to start at the beginning and retrain him to walk correctly with only his collar when with other dogs, too.The Premier Head Collar is a highly effective tool, it just wasn't quite right for our situations. To avoid the same negativity issues with our new youngsters but obtain the same principles of control (turning the dog when it pulls and having excellent control in excitable situations as they learn good leash manners) we used the Premier Easy Walk harness--clipped to their martingale collars for extra safety, since athletic and determined dogs can wriggle out of the harness. They have transitioned from use of the harness to just their collars as they get older with none of the problems we had trying to transition from Head Collar to martingale only. This was probably entirely our fault but others might have had the same issues, too."
167844,1,"I've been using this product for about 5 weeks and am completely satisfied. I had some concerns about the durability of the pyramid shaped model so I went with the galvanized steel model even though I only have 1 large breed dog. This model also came fully assembled and ready for the ground. The free scooper that was supposed to come with it was not included, so I was gyped there. The lid is hinged and opens easily but also will stay open for you which is great. I took some shortcuts on installation that have not affected operation. 1st, I started using a post hole digger but quickly went to the shovel. Don't buy the diggers just for this job-they are not essential. I also didn't dig the full 4 feet recommended. If you have good drainage, its not needed in my opinion. I dug deep enough to house the unit with an additional 8-12 inches of clearance and have experienced no problems. You'll want to install this near the end of your water hoses reach away from the house. It doesn't reek too bad until you open the door and flush the system with the hose. Thats when that liquified poop stirs up. I add stool about every other day and flush the system weekly. The enzyme has lasted this long(5 wks.) with half a bag left and I am pretty liberal with it. Buying the extra bucket of enzyme is inevitable."
106090,0,"My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks. I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay. After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled. I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training."

The only drawback is that the straps that hold the back of the coat in place are such that when the dog urinates, the straps get wet. To avoid this we put the velcro straps on top of the coat.

193377,2,"There is no reason on earth for this product to exist. Regardless on where one stands on the use of shock collars, invisible fencing, etc., teaching a down-stay to a dog is not rocket science. With this product, the dog is shocked when he ventures away from the bed. This in and of itself is unnecessary and inhumane. But add to that the fact that dogs associate things that happen concurrently, and you've got the makings of much bigger problems than a faulty ""stay."" The dog could easily be looking at, let's say, your child when he gets shocked, thus associating the two. This can set up a dangerous dynamic. Even if the dog is not looking at a particular person when receiving an electronic correction, this type of punishment could easily create fear or aggression issues. PLEASE consider simply training your dog instead of taking this seemingly easy way out. Training a solid down-stay is NOT very difficult, and you won't be risking creating much bigger problems."
133652,0,I am rateing the Grissly Salmon Oil 3 stars as of now....it might be a little too early to give a true review as other users have said it takes a few months to really know. On the positive side i can see a difference in the shedding and the condition of my dogs coat.

184356,2,"I've had this system for about 4 years. At first,the system worked well and the dog quickly learned to ""mind"" the fence. But I've recently moved to another home and have tried to reinstall the fence.This time, things are not going well. I have used about 400' of wire in completing the new fence installation. After several weeks of effort, as many as 4 calls to PetSafe's technical support, and even two replacement transmitters provided by the manufacturer, my system still dosen't work. I can get good results if I limit my fence length to about 200' and I have tried laying out two of these loops. When each is connected to the transmitter, the fence and collar work fine. But, when I join the two loops together into one larger continuous circuit, the system totally fails. Petsafe says the transmitter can handle my length of wire.... But they can't explain why mine doesn't work.Petsafe says the system must not have damage to the wire's insullation, and is very sensitive to things like splices, use of different size wire in installing the circuit, broken insulation, and so on. They even told me to bury the wire inside an irrigation pipe. I've done it... still no luck.I'm still working to correct my difficulty.... but am very frustrated by the poor result."
187804,1,"What a great grooming tool! I bought it because I have three long-haired cats and always seem to be vacumming up hair. The Shed Ender got down to the undercoat, just like it claimed. I was absolutely amazed at how much fur I pulled out of their coats! I had brushed them with a regular brush before I started, and gotten very little hair off. The Shed Ender removed piles and piles of hair - in fact, the pile of hair was almost as big as my cat! It took a little practice to get the hang of how to use it, but I was very impressed with the results. It takes some time to go through the animal's whole coat, but it's toally worth it!Other reviewers said they liked the Furminator better, but it costs quite a bit more. I went to a local pet store to check out the prices of the Furminator, and the least expensive one (the smallest) was $34.95 (versus the same size Shed Ender at $9.99!). I say, try the Shed Ender first - you'll love it!"
26214,2,"Booda Bimple bones used to be my dog's favorite chew. He's intensely driven to chew, when he's got something he's chewing on, you can see he's in some sort of zoned-out bliss. The large Booda Bimples used to take my small Cairn Terrier a week to get through and he loved every moment of it.Then came the ""New! More digestible!"" Booda Bimple. The same size bone now takes my dog 15 minutes to chew (no exaggeration) when it took a week before. And it gives him a mighty bad digestive upset the next day. The new formulation may break down in the stomach more than the old ones, but it's not a good thing. If we limit him to 1/3 of a bone, the diarrhea doesn't happen but he gets less chewing, it's more like eating a treat.I am certain that the modification of the formula was a result of all of the media coverage of the Greenies issue, where dogs chewing unsupervised gulped down big pieces and got blockages. The Bimples probably had the same potential if a dog swallowed a large chunk. But, since I supervised my dog while chewing and made sure he didn't gulp big hunks, we've lost a real source of pleasure for my pet."

I am 2/3 of the way through the container, and my lawn still has the brown spots on it. To be honest, none of them are from Ben, as we trained him to go on a mulched area off the lawn. It's all little Zoey. Maybe girl pee is different? I never miss a dose, and give it to Ben just to be safe, in case he should cheat. My brother, who is a scientist, laughs at the bottle every time he comes to my house. He swears it's one of the greatest wastes of money I've managed yet.

89924,0,"For the price, I wasn't expecting the Cadillac of pet feeders, but I was disappointed at how cheaply made this product seems to be, at least in one regard. As soon as I took it out, one of the longer reversible wood panels dropped out of its slot and wouldn't stay put no matter how much I tried to finagle it (including turning it around). I could have returned it, but I decided to just take that one panel out, as it really isn't necessary to the functioning of the feeder (it's merely decorative), and place the feeder so the intact side faces the front. That did the trick and other than this issue, I really like how the feeder looks and works. It's nice being able to take out the stainless steel bowls (I wanted to avoid plastic as my cat's allergic) and refill them, clean them, etc. My cat seems to like it too. Now, we'll see how well it ages."
89994,0,"I was so tired of scrubbing nasty litter boxes for my six ferrets and I was hoping this product was the answer. Sadly it wasn't the solution for me. Was hoping I could just throw out the boxes and replace them when they got ""bad"", but these boxes are too expensive for that. Also, my ferrets shreaded the boxes (which made them leak) and since they were paper, it was hard to secure them in the cage and my ferrets moved them all over the place (they have a large cage).Every ferret is different and perhaps yours will not shread these. If you are using them as corner boxes in your house (not the cage) they may work for you.If the price on these dropped to the point that I could toss them on a daily or every other day bases it would have probably worked. Oh well... back to scrubbing litter boxes.... (big sigh)"

Many, many people highly recommended this product to me, however, and THEY would have rated it 4 or even 5 stars.I realized that it was easily administrated by placing the drops in olive oil. My cat loves olive oil and licked up the Tinkle Tonic very readily in this manner. I believe a little tiny dose of olive oil is good for cats, though caloric; it is good for their coat and skin and digestive tract, in small doses. Some people have suggested salmon or fish oil.If I had to administer orally-well, don't even go there......"
99417,2,"I purchased this to replace the older model of Petsafe two meal feeder, which was never perfect, and at first this looked like an improvement. It is not. Unlike the original, the timers seem even less precise, and most importantly, the timers are easily jammed by pets playing with the lids after they've opened. If your pet is like my cat, it knows there is food in this device and is going to play with it to try to get the food out, and probably disable the device in the process (ie knock the battery loose or jam an open lid against the timer, meaning kitty gets the first meal but not the second, which is what happened the first time I used it). I recommend trying to find one of the older Petsafe feeders. As I said, they werent perfect, but they worked well enough to rely on them while away for a day or so."
60905,0,"My cats are the kind who like to break everything apart. If I get a regular round bed, they play with it and move it all around the room.So I thought since this bed has a base, they won't be able to move it and would love to sleep on it.However, they separated the upper bed from it's base and were just playing with it.One of my cats preferred to just go under the bed all the while.Finally, we just tied the corners of the bed with cords and tried to stuff something under the bed.I have 3 cats. Only 1 of my cats now uses it sometimes. The other 2 are not interested in this bed.Also, it's a bed only for a medium sized cat."

162408,2,"Got this in 2009, had it installed professionally and in a new screen door. Works great and easy to teach little dogs to get in and out. However, in about a year the flap cracked and part finally just fell off. They dont seem to offer just the flap. I am really disappointed."
131596,0,"my dog will go after this and retrieve it, but getting it to soar just the right way is a PAIN. it kinda soars lop-sided and i guess thats ok. it would go farther if I could perfect the throw. either way, its fine, but my pointer like the chuck it thrower and balls the best. I think someone mentions this floats, if so, that's a plus. I havent tried it in water yet"
33997,0,"I Got this product for my large lab who is aging and can't bend over to eat off the ground any more. It does this task very well, and could be adjusted to fit nearly any mid sized to large dog. It looks nice and seems pretty well built. The bowls move around just a little but not enough to really make a difference. I would have given more stars BUT when the product came it had a pretty big scratch in the wood and one of the legs was missing the pin to keep it locked in place. I made it work, but for a new product it should show up nearly flawless in my opinion. Otherwise it was well worth the money and I am thinking about purchasing another similar product for my other lab."
187921,0,"I have two pit bulls who only have one toy a piece that has held up to their chewing habits (cow femurs...huge, heavy, hurt when they are dropped on toes, but so durable). I thought this would be a great thing to try out because they need more stimulation but it didn't work out. I am not saying this product is not for anyone, if your dog is a casual chewer this would be great, but my dogs destroyed this thing in less than one hour. Our smaller dog managed to chew the handle off in about 10 minutes and I watched in dismay as they made this ball disappear leaving only tiny pieces of red rubber that both dogs were now consuming! I thought for sure it would at least take a few days! I should have taken it away when they got the handle off but I hoped they would stop there. On the plus side it didn't make them sick or require a trip to the vet but it just didn't hold up to my tough chewers. If you have a smaller dog, or a dog who knows that toys are a privilege and not food, this product may be for you but be sure to monitor the dog at all times with this toy (at least until you know they aren't going to eat it!). Good luck!"

145962,1,I just love this container for my dogs' 15lb bag of Royal Canin. I put the bag itself into the container and then am able to keep the food airtight without trying to close a zip lock top which is difficult for my rheumatic hands. Very pleased with this item.
91017,0,Our dogs love lounging on this bed. They fight over whose turn it is to use it. I just hope it lasts a year. Their claws have poked holes in the fabric some dime sized some quarter sized.
198625,2,My mother in law owns about 9 kittens. The product fell over one morning and crushed the kitten. the kittens that knocked it down were between 5 and 7 lbs. My mother in law even took extra precautions by setting it up against the wall and a chair for two sided stabilazation. If you are thinking about buying this please reconsider for something with a wider base.

10603,2,This stuff does not work. I bought it based on the Amazon.com review. I tried it on pee and vomit from my dog. It did not get out the yellow of the vomit nor did it get out the pee smell. Total waste of money. Water worked better.
208264,1,This is a great product at a great price! It saves on the cat litter mess and my cat used it without a problem.
38457,1,"Trust me. You will not regret buying this litter box. It is so easy to clean. I was continually frustrated with the electric LitterMaid and it's issues. It is now in the trash. I'm slightly embarrassed to say that I had a little trouble with the Omega Paw at first...because I put it together wrong. :-/ The directions are a little vague. If you buy this and are having trouble with it, turn the grate around! Solved all my problems!"

1959,2,"My [now 12 week old] miniature schnauzer loves this toy, but it did not last. Within one week, the [then 7 week old] puppy had ripped open the seam along the back of the toy, so we took the squeaker out so she wouldn't choke on it. She wasn't big enough to squeak it herself anyway. I've let her play with it a few more weeks, and she loves to chase and attack it, but I have to take it away now because there's too much stuffing coming out the top and back of the toy, where the seams ripped. There was never any rough play or tug-of-war with it. This is just clearly not a well made dog toy. It seems more like a child's stuffed animal that they just slapped an AKC endorsement on. I expected better quality."
116584,0,"UPDATE: The unit including the roof has now lasted more then a year my hens are still safely secured each night in it.Roof and Kennel: My 6'1 hubby put this together by himself but I don't think I could have.Roof: I would buy this again for convenience but only because I own a pipe cutter.The main bar was about a foot too long. Better too long then too short!* PetSafe 9007513 7.5-By-13-Foot E-Z Roof for PetSafe KennelsKennel: The chain link had way too much and had to be trimmed.Again, better then not enough and better then starting from scratch.Not for someone who is not at all handy but two unhandy people can do this (DIY).The chain link attaches to the frame via metal rods which get put on like ubber tough twisties, even hubby's hands were very sore after. So get gloves if you do not have any.The project took about 12 hours to be up and ready - someone with more skill could have it done in 3-4 hours, imo.I paid a total of 350 for both kennel and roof add-on with free shipping.It turned out great and I am happy with the end result.I recommend for those prepared to put some elbow grease into the assembly.I give a 3 because ease of assembly was misrepresented and having to cut pipes and trim the fencing is asking a lot by the way the item is represented."
78472,1,"The Easy Walk harness is the best invention. It's like a miracle for my 50 lb blk lab who would pull so hard and choke himself the entire walk. I hesitated to use the gentle leaders - with a black dog, sometimes people are afraid of this love bug and the leader looked too much like a muzzle. I'm so glad I found this instead. Walks are so relaxed and enjoyable now. It took a couple of tries to fit him but I found a helpful youtube video online. I paid a lot more for this at petco but had to return the large for a medium size because he's petite. Highly recommend!"
71806,2,"Sorry to say it didn't work!The setting is only one frequency.My cats walked right in front of it with no effect. Only one of my cats responded and it was because she was younger, and I assume, had better hearing.On the other hand the ""The Garden Creations JB5028 Ultrasonic Cordless Pest Repeller"", worked very well and had a number of frequencies to pick from. If one freq didn't work, I was able to pick another until it did work."

142462,2,"OK. I read the reviews... I'm not a rookie LitterMaid user... I understand it requires some upkeep. That being said....I decided to go with the older model as most of the veteran LitterMaid users suggested. I got it... set it up... turned it on... the cats came running and put a big dukie in it. It worked PERFECTLY! Whew! Then...It didnt stop running back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. The darn thing was BROKE! The carriage would not stay parked. GRRRRrr!SO. I couldnt return it until I had another litter box, so I ran to Target and picked up the NEW model. BIGGER MISTAKE! What a piece of JUNK! First, I""m not an idiot, but I had a hard time putting that darn thing together. I'm not even sure I did it right. Secondly, like most reviewers wrote, that motor couldnt move a fly let-a-lone a bowel movement. It could barely push itself through the plain unused litter. (No, I've never overfilled it... its never even been past the fill line).I returned the broke one to Amazon... had to complain when they wanted to charge me a ""restocking"" fee. But finally got a complete refund of my money. I'm in the process of returning the even crappier one to target... just need to go get ANOTHER litter box. My husband made me promise... no more automated litter boxes. Man I'm disappointed!"
122016,0,"I hoped this would work for my RES turtles, but the 60 watt version just didn't produce enough heat.Since regular basking lamps are fragile and burn out so easily, I liked the idea of a solidly constructed ceramic heat emitter.If i buy another I'll be sure to get a much higher wattage.Over all, the heat without light concept is very convenient."

OK for us, since our litterbox is in the garage, but this might drive others crazy. Just need to perfect this small design flaw, and it would be a great litterbox!"
40813,2,"Gate came apart the second day of use. Poorly constructed, non durable. I would return this but I threw out the carton it came in and the size is so unusual that I haven't found a way to send it back to the manufacturer. My advice, buy another product."

104889,2,My poor year-old terrier tore pieces of this toy apart in a few minutes and ingested a few of the tiny fragments. A few hours later she vomited for half of the night - at least 12-14 times. Nothing else would have caused her to be sick - the toy was the only new addition to her nighttime routine. I emailed the company today about this product - it should be taken off the shelves. In no way should this chew toy be labeled safe and non-toxic!!!

63865,1,"I installed this pre-filter on a hang on the back power filter in a 20 gallon aquarium. It was easy to fit on the intake tube, and it works beautifully for keeping my plants and shrimp from getting sucked into the filter.However, it is large in the tank and, due to this, it presses against the back wall of the tank and sits a little unevenly. If you have a 20 gallon or smaller, I recommend finding a smaller version of this prefilter. If not, you can make this one work, and if needed, I bet you can trim the sponge a bit to make it fit better."
151523,2,"I spent $6 on this bone and it lasted 4 minutes. I got it in the biggest size available (the souper). I realize it's edible and won't last like the nylabone, but I expected it to last longer than 4 minutes! I'm not exaggerating. When I realized how quickly it was going down, I started watching the clock. I only recommend this bone if you are looking for a tasty milkbone kinda bone."
212889,1,I use this product for my dog that has hypothyroidism. It's great for her skin and coat because she has skin irritations associated with the disorder.

79345,1,"I ordered this gate because it was exactly what I was looking for. Started to set it up, no instructions except for what's on the back of the box (very minimal), but I figured how hard could it be? After 4 different attempts at making the bumper bolts work, I was very frustrated and about to send the darn thing back. Then I looked at the reviews again and found the solution!Find the 4-star review written by alooknac from Montana. She does a great job at explaining how the bumpers are supposed to work. Once you get them on right, the gate works like a charm. My gate didn't have the exact same hardware as in the pictures, either. Don't take the ""nuts"" off the bumper bolts, just stick them as is in the holes. Adjust your gate to the right length for your doorway. Then turn the nuts AWAY from the bumpers, toward the gate, to tighten. TA-DA!!Thank goodness for Amazon reviews, and thanks alooknac. :)"
47847,0,"I own a cat, like most cats they won't super indulge in food... for a dog I would be a little wary. Moving the product is hard because the tops pop out easy... I have twice spilled food all over the floor. (do not want to experience the water one)But overall I like it."
107169,0,"i find that this cage doesnt stop lilly from getting out, i've tryed everything to keep her in it. the bars are spaced to big. this would be a great starter home if only it would keep her in there. she loves her wheel tho and never takes a brake good deal and an okay product."
36599,0,I had better expectations for this. Overall its OK but it is not very handy. I got the large one and it is big and clumsy walking around with it collecting poop.I think the smaller version would maybe be a bit more handy and I would rather go two trips than having to move the big version around.Definately not worth $50.
101275,1,The dogs really enjoy the nylabones. They will be needing more soon. We will be using this site to purchase them.
63349,0,I was a little disappointed in the quality of leather used. I have owned other leather leashes and this one is very stiff and somewhat inflexible. It is hard on the hands.
175095,1,"My Pitt/Boxer mix loves this ball. Actually, love is an understatement. She is obsessed with this ball. She brings it everywhere she goes, proudly showing it off to anyone and everyone.In addition this ball is durable, easy to clean, and has not lost its color. It is very bouncy and has not lost its shape or been punctured, despite my dogs constant chewing on it.The best toy I have found my dog yet, and she has quite a few. I plan to order this item routinely so there is always a back-up stash in case we lose the one we have in current play."
108660,2,"First of all this product is very expensive for what you get. Also, it discharges itself constantly even if it isn't in contact with anything. Just holding the unit by the battery pack up in the air and I can hear it discharging. That means that it will shock the pet, but the pet has to be touching it when it goes off and the recharge cycle is maybe 10 seconds as opposed to it just going off when the pet touches it. I'm very surprised that someone can't come up with a better implementation of this type of product because as a dog owner with a dog that can actually open a completely shut metal trash can it would be very helpful."
37332,0,"This works like promised... giving a nicer sheen to my kitty's coat since I don't give her wet food (wet food made her a demanding whiny cat, weird, right?!).However, the dispenser pump leaks and the bottle gets sticky. Kinda gross.I also try not to give her this every day since I think it clogged the pores on her chin and lead to some kitty acne which she never had until using this. Once I stopped using it, the kitty acne went away. So in the future I'll make sure to wipe off her little chin after she eats food with the fish oil. But it is great for her coat and less dandruff."
123802,1,"Great price for a high performance canister filter! Assembly and installation was exteremely fast and easy. Within a couple of hours of operation, the water in my 29g goldfish tank was crystal clear. The filter is very quiet, I can barely notice noise coming from the filter. The quick disconnect valve and the easy replacement of filter media makes maintenance is a breeze. Thumbs up for Rena!"
139271,0,"only three of the four types of seed really sprouted. my cat loved it and munched on it constantly. however, just about a week ago, it all pretty much died. maybe my cat munched too hard? i still have the nice container, so i'm just going to get the seeds it came with and replant them in the container. maybe thats what i should have done to begin with. its a nice container though."
178958,0,"My cats had zero problem with me moving the litter box into the bathroom, and switching their litter to a flushable kitty litter (I use Feline Pine). However, they have not taken to step one of the CitiKitty system. One problem is that my toilets are not standard and have very wide sides. I had to cut off the sides of the CitiKitty tray to get it to sit in the toilet. I've taped it on to the toilet now, which makes it much more difficult to remove and clean. However, my cats still won't use it. They have taken to peeing on a rug and/or going outside. I'm thinking about getting a deeper aluminum bowl and trying that instead. I don't know if it's the flimsiness (from having to cut off the sides of the tray) or the lack of depth that makes it difficult to bury their stuff. I've been stuck at this stage for a month now and have not gotten my two cats to use the tray consistently. There have been one or two instances but that's all."
51379,0,The hutch is great and went together easily. Please note it does not come with the required wire clip pliers one needs to put it together. So add $15 to the price.
57507,0,"I'm on the fence about this product. Before you go any further, this product has been the most effective of the many products we have tried. Frankly, we have a major flea problem and I have tried everything under the sun: Program tablets, Capstar tablets, both of those together, IGI-based yard and indoor sprays, flea-attractant lamps, flea baths/dips/sprays/powders from various manufacturers, and, finally, insecticides for yard and home. We've tried earth-friendly and herbal remedies as well as the more objectionable poisonous chemical remedies with little success. I've spent well over $1000 dollars this summer trying to get some relief from our flea problem. One of my cats actually needed sub-q fluids and iron supplements because she was anemic from the fleas despite all these efforts. (Is it the weather this year??) The vet told me this was the best possible treatment to get on top of the flea problem. That's scary because after 2 months of treatment, we still have fleas. I grant you, the problem has improved significantly but we do still have fleas. It seems that the first week after treatment, we see no fleas or eggs at all, but then as the month progresses, they start reappearing. I will continue buying this since it has been more effective than anything else. We are still using a multi-pronged approach - treating the pets and the yard and home with the IGI and insecticide sprays. I hate having to use the insecticide sprays, but these fleas were killing my fur-babies. I had to take drastic measures. I do want to warn everyone that this product will not work very well at all if you do not follow the directions for application TO THE LETTER. It's not as simple as just dripping it on their backs. We have had several news reports recently about improper application of these ""spot"" type treatments being a big part of why they do not work very well and/or why pets get sick from their use. Read and follow the directions, exactly. That being said, don't waste your money on just any ""spot"" type treatment. Get the Frontline PLUS or you'll be shopping for another solution to your problem within a couple of weeks."
120610,0,"These blades came with no clear instructions, no diagram, and mostly in foreign languages. It took much too long to figure it out and even though they look the same as the ones they're replacing, I'm not even sure they work well now. Maybe that's because of my inexperience putting these things together. Once assembled, they did not clip well at all.If you know what you'r doing, ie; are a groomer or someone with lots of experience replacing blades on clippers, this was otherwise probably a good source."
33454,1,Buster has long ago finished this bag but it was a super buy and he loves them!~ I never give him rawhide things to eat or chew...just the natural pig ears or strips. They even helped clean his teeth! He's still a happy camper at 14 and loves getting his favorite surprise!
10372,2,"These boots are very stiff and our dog would not move when wearing these. It is very hard to put them on, as they stretch very little, and it was complete waste of money."
159661,0,"Before I tried this collar, we tried a regular chemical one. That one had an odor my wife and I both found unpleasant, so much so that we started avoiding our cat. Plus, the chemical collar did nothing to get rid of the fleas. So, we tried this one instead. It was better than the chemical one in one major way: it smelled terrific. Even now, after 2 months on the cat, it smells very nice. Unfortunately the fleas remained - we had to kill them with some pills. I do not know if this collar will prevent re-infestation, but it definitely did not get rid of existing fleas. One other disadvantage is that there is no safety release, which makes me a little worried."
58445,0,"I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one."
1925,1,"Our dog loved this goose. It has a squeaker in it, but this one actually makes a goose call. Bella loved it soo much that she did end up ripping it apart. But it took her a few days. And who can blame large dogs for tearing these things to shreds. They are meant to look like the animals they naturally hunt. She loved it and she even loved it once all the stuffing was out of it. I'm getting another one today."
56929,0,"My poor cats were infested with fleas. One of my cats was really itching away and starting to pull the fur from her neck. We bought the Frontline Plus to try and help kill the fleas on the cats - well, they still have fleas. Of course, we are aware that we need to rid the fleas from the environment also (we are going to bomb today), but the frontline did not keep the fleas off of the cats in the mean time. We are going to try Advantage next. I know people who use that over the frontline and see more results."
40989,0,"We bought this gate for our entry way, which is very wide area with a step that our 6 month old was trying to crawl down. It is one of the longest baby gates on the market currently. However, the product description states that the gate is 8 1/2 feet wide (102""), but the gate we received is only 94"". It is 6"" short! Unfortunately 94"" was too short to secure our entry way. My husband ended placing a 2x4 up between the end of the gate and the wall. We decided to use the product and keep it, as we couldn't find a longer one, but I wish it had been the length it was advertised. Otherwise, the gate latches well and is sturdy."
81875,0,"This bench seat cover is great for washing, but it lacks a good way to keep it in place on the back of the seat. Once the dogs walk around and laydown and get up it starts to streatch eventually the elastic will come apart. Would not buy again."
34456,0,I wouldn't recommend this toy for a dog that is a strong chewer. The music is annoying but it drives our dog crazy in a good way for him. Good size toy for a medium size dog.
207351,1,"This crate is a good quality product. I researched several different brands of fabric crates and found this one to be easy to setup and take down and made well. My only suggestion for the company would be to try and make the mesh of lighter color so as not to absorb the heat from the sun (when outside) and to allow better vision for the dog inside and for the owner to observe dog from outside the crate. Also, it would be a nice addition to have zipper ""locks"" on it just in case a dog ""tested"" the zipper.Our two grown labs each have used it and seem to be comfortable in it. We have the 36"" long (blue) crate."
23776,0,I bought this product to go inside a kennel that i also purchased. I like this bed in that it is pretty. But it really isn't quite as padded as I'd hoped it would be. But it looks very nice inside my punch pink kennel.
69519,2,"This helped my dog start growling instead of stop barking.He figured it out pretty quick. If he let out a few yaps, it went off, so he just started doing a deeper bark / growl - maybe I just have a smart dog!"
31063,2,"I have a Classic Kennel that I bought from Petco for $55. I wanted a second crate for crate training and bought this one because I thought they were comparable. They are not.The Petmate kennel is made from flimsy plastic compared to the Classic Kennel. You can feel the plastic flex on the Petmate. The Classic Kennel has quality screws that attach the top to the bottom; the Petmate has cheap molded plastic clips. The door fits perfectly on the Classic Kennel; the door is ill-fitted on the Petmate and is difficult to close.Basically, it looks like the Petmate went with the cheapest materials to keep their costs down. I would not transport an animal in it, although I will keep it for crate training. Too difficult to return.Update: 6/9/2009After having this kennel for about 1 week, I have been able to get the door to close by taking the reviewer's advice above. I cut away some of the plastic to the kennel opening. I also had to reverse the door (open right to left). However, the cheap plastic clips that hold the kennel together keep popping off."
143871,2,"The motor part has design flaws. The motor is heavy but the two holding clips are very small and fragile. Mine broke on arrival, Please see the uploaded phone above.

After I say ""yes"", then the phone will ring and ring and ring, after it rings for a while, a voice says""that's a invalid entry"". then it restarts the ""if you like to speak to the operator, please say yes"" cycle.This is very upsetting b/c I was depending on the filter to replace my malfunctioning Aqueon. Now I don't know if I should just return it to amazon, or just try to contact hagen to send me a replacement motor, and that won't happen at least for a week. Meantime, what should I do?Second thought, Hagen has some quality control issues. I also had an aquaclear 30 gallon filter, and after a while it started to leak water from the motor/container junction. But I had another aqaclear 20 that worked just fine for 8 months. I know it may not be a fair assessment based on broken clips, but no customer service by phone during work hours is totally ridiculous for such a big international company."
62210,1,"I use the product mostly to prevent ticks from getting on my dogs. Advantix works really well. Once applied Advantix is totally effective within two days. Even during this first day or so tick might get on the dog, but will not break the skin to feed. After a few days the ticks will not even get on the dog. I check my dogs after every walk and do not find any tick or fleas. I find the application lasts more than a month. This is a very effective product, also does not irritate my dogs skin like some other product I have used. I would recommend this product to a friend."

8743,2,"This feeder works fine, however, it is the most difficult thing to clean I've ever had! First of all the container is a really awkward shape. It does not fit in your hand very well due to it's wide girth. An old soda bottle would be easier to handle! Secondly, it has a very small mouth which makes it difficult to insert a bottle brush. Then on the inside there are small plastic squiggles that hold the nectar dispensing buttons on which are also difficult to clean. The other problem is emptying the bottle. It's flattened at the bottom and even with vigorous shaking you can never completely empty it.If they were to change the shape of the bottle (make it smaller in girth and widen the mouth) It could be a great product!"
124814,0,Smooth transaction. Shipping was prompt. I use Advantage every year and it works great. The only problem I have with this order is: I don't see an expiration date anywhere on the box nor on the tubes. This makes me wonder how old the product is. I'm sure the Expiration date is somewhere among the numbers but I have no clue where to find the date. I just applied the product 2 days ago. We shall see.

27806,1,"I bought this product (size: small, sold by amazon, LLC) for my 18 lbs. Sheltie. The collar fits her snugly and stays in place on her neck. There are lots of ribbons, making the collar look very full. There are also tons of little red and green jingle bells. Unlike other collars like this which glue accessories on the end of the ribbons, the jingle bells are actually tired in place. I'm not sure if this makes them more or less secure as I'm not giving me dog the opportunity to see how well they are attached. My only complaint is that these are not true to size. I measured my dog's neck as slightly less than 10 inches. The collar is elastic and relaxed is much smaller than 10 in., but it does easily stretch to that size. I should have ordered a medium, but this one will be just fine for taking some cute Christmas pictures in."

7304,0,"I have 2 large (17 lb) cats who tend to tip over the front door style boxes. For one of my cats, this was the perfect box. He could scratch and fling and there was no tracking. Perfect. Our other cat was a different story. She did not like going down into the box and at first she was clever and sat on the top and did her business into the hole, just like using a toilet. Good kitty!!! But then, she got sloppy and would just go anywhere on the top of the box. Ick. Bad Kitty!!! That was the end of that.

Yes, I should have read the description better, but with two shown and a price of over $5, I naturally assumed I was getting two lids. Nope, only one showed up.Also, I have to agree with other users about the lack of usefulness for small cans. My cat will only eat food that comes in three-ounce cans. This seemed to be the only lid that would fit that small of a can. It went on easy enough, but the &#34;just pull up on the kitty ears&#34; thing is not really working.

128634,0,"I purchased the Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel toy for my 3-year old ""niece"", a yellow Labrador retriever. She truly loves chew toys, and is extremely fond of ones that contain ""squeakers"" inside of them. Since I dogsit for my brother-in-law and his family when they are out of town, I wanted to get Bella something special during her time at my home for the week while they were gone.With that said, I picked up the Jumbo sized Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel toy while it was on a Lightning Deal from Amazon. I liked the idea that this toy was more interactive for dogs and thus would provide hours of fun and enjoyment. When the product arrived, I liked that the size was suitable for large breed dogs, and I felt confident that the toy would last, as it seemed to be made of quality materials.This feeling lasted perhaps an hour when the first casualty arrived in the form of a gutted out squirrel with its guts strewn across my living room. A few hours later, squirrels #2 and #3 were also laid to rest and I had a sizable pile of white stuffing sitting on my kitchen table. I found that the stitched seams of the squirrels are a major weak point, as the seams easily tore apart during pet play. No other parts of the squirrels were damaged however, so I re-stuffed the squirrels and stitched them back up using heavier-duty thread.Aside from the rather weak stitched seams on the squirrels, the toy definitely exceeded my expectations where pet enjoyment and fun are concerned. Bella enjoys carrying the stump around, with the squirrels inside, and showing visitors how she can remove them from the tree. As far as overall quality goes though, the stitching on the toy definitely needs improvement, although if you're handy with needle and some good heavy thread, you can stitch up your squirrels without having to buy replacements.Overall, I would recommend this toy for dog owners, as long they are warned that some repair may be needed to the toy after a few hours of playtime."

Before starting Cosequin DS it seemed she was fairly uncomfortable when getting up from laying down and had a hard time getting up on the bed. On cold days she was really stiff and had a hard time moving around. Our vet told us to start her out with two in the morning with breakfast and one with her dinner. We started this regimen on December 28th and, after less than three weeks, the change in her is phenomenal! She is running and playing with our other dogs again and jumping up on the bed is now a breeze. I can see she is a much happier dog and I only regret that we didn't try this sooner.I highly recommend this product but I also highly recommend talking to your veterinarian before using this or any other product to make sure this is right for your pet."

61480,2,"We recently purchased the newest LitterMaid. After a month of use, we have decided it is worse than manually scooping the litter. Four to five times a day we have to go and scoop the litter box manually because the motor is not strong enough to push the rake to the end of the litter box. Instead, it will keep going back and forth from the middle to the back. We have attempted reducing the litter, but this does not help. The ""improved"" rake also does not scoop all of the feces when it does scoop. I think that since this company charges so much money on this product that they could use some of it on improvements for future versions of the Litter Maid. The older version was much better than this one. If I could go back and make my purchase again, I would have bought the older version again."

Walmart sells a similar brand for half the price (less than $8). The reflective material stays on much better & the leash from Walmart has lasted almost a year with out pulling apart. I have already replaced this red leash with a red one from Walmart & will be buying a 2nd black one to replace the blue one I bought.

Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her. I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day. Good thing I bought the small bottle!

32118,0,"PROS: Overall, we like the drinkwell fountain for our cats, and they like it too. If we had a place to put another one, would even have a second fountain somewhere else in the apartment.CONS: Constant issues with the motor. With the first fountain, the motor eventually broke and made a REALLY loud noise, so we bought an entire second fountain. With this one, the motor seems to be slightly too large of a circumference for the hole it fits in, and is almost impossible to turn it and get it out. We tried it in both the old fountain bowl and the new one and it is just not the correct size. So now we have the choice of a loud motor or practically spraining a hand getting it in and out.It was already difficult in general to deal with the original motor with the way that there is only a tiny place to brace your hand when turning it, but this too-large-motor takes an extreme amount of elbow grease (difficult to do with nowhere to brace your hand without breaking the bowl). Ordered a replacement motor from petsafe.com, but this is Drinkwell's last chance. If this one doesn't work, I'm buying a completely different brand of fountain. Lastly, a pain to take apart and clean all of the pieces, but as other reviewers have said, if you use filtered water (we always have), you can easily get away with cleaning only once a week, which is not bad.However, overall, the fountain works well (once the motor is in) and I think has encouraged the cats to drink more. Would love to give 5 stars if the motor wasn't always such an enormous problem."

181633,1,"Below is the original post. A few months later the nozzle, no matter how many times you soak it will only drip. I would buy a replacement but I can't find one anywhere. I wish there was more competition in the market for this. I still use it but it is not enough.*************************************************This product is great. It not only saves you loads of time from hand pumping the mist but also gives your pet and plants what they need. No matter what your schedule is , your pet/ plant is getting fresh water and the terranium has increased humidity levels. At first my veiled chameleon was thrown off from the sound but he got used to it in less than 2 days. Its also great for the ficus I have in their because I have two heat lamps on in the winter and the constant mist (I have it scheduled to mist for 60 seconds every hour) prevents the tree from drying out. Important tip is to use filtered water or else you will have to soak the nozzle in vinegar really often. I really think it is great. I just went away on vacation and had my friend come to feed him. It was great to know that he had access to water the day she wasn't able to show up."
79145,0,"This harness definitely stopped both my dogs from pulling, but it does that by squeezing their front legs together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and is definitely better than pulling at their necks and choking them.I think I had it fit correctly, but the reason that I took away two stars is that this rubbed both my long haired Golden and my short haired Dobie mix raw in their armpits. The harnesses were used for running with the dogs, and they may have just been on too tight, but I stopped using them after these rashes developed. I still prefer this company's Gentle Leader, which is a head collar. It stops pulling just as well as the Easy Walk."

196139,0,"As a long time owner of automatic litter boxes I find the new design to be structurally negative. The only good effect of the newer design over older designs, is that a larger cat may find it more room but... here are the problems.1. The larger size is design in a thinner plastic, double walls with space between. Creates a weak structur, bulky, flimsy and subject to cracks or breakage.2. Makes you feel you are getting more for the NOW high price; but it is overkill in size and takes up too much space. I still keep one of my old old, smaller litter boxes because the structure is well made and it is easier to take with me when I travel with my cat, and easier to find a place that gives me aesthetics beside function. Its size causes my cat to throw more litter around and I'm constantly cleaning up the floor around it.. not so with the smaller model.3. The rake is good but now it is a chore to put the bottom of the container for the dirty litter into place. Again I believe the cheaper design probably saves the company money and I pay for it in fustration.4. You have to be careful in moving it around. The bulk creates few hand holds and if your not careful you put strain on a weak part. I have spent a lot of time glueing this costly unit together while my old old Litter Maid is still strong and has been packed back and forth across the United States a few times. This new design is just moved so I can sweep under it and I dare not do much moving unless I take it apart and move each piece seperate.5. Unless you have this massive problem with a litter box running at night when you sleep, the clock is useless and you shouldn't buy into gimicks. Just turn the switch off at night. Give me a break.6. Don't know how much clean air or dust it keeps down. I have no visable way of knowing if it really works?Should you buy one? Well the stores don't seem to carry the less expensive litter box, put out by this company. And I didn't find them on line so I assume the company has decided bigger, cheaper and cost more is the way to go. All are over $100 now and the $89 old models were superior. All I can say is 'Litter Maid, you had a good product but greed is ruining your creation'."

Because of the reviews I read about this running small I decided to go for a size Large even though 'small' was the recommendation for Pugs.

102828,1,"I ordered this post primarily because of its size. This is a large scratching post, the top of it is even with the top of the back of my sofa. I really suspect the sofa was occasionaly still used as a scratcher because of it offered a bigger stretch than the small posts I'd made available.After placing this post in a common location and moving one of the smaller rope wound posts to the side, I see the cats using it frequently, but also still see them using the small rope one as well.In my attempt at cat mind reading:1) Texture and feel: Excellent, as good or better than the back of the sofa.2) Height: Ecellent, allows for big stretches.3) Stability: the base is sufficiently large and firmly mounted that there's no fear that it is going to be tipped over.4) Complaint: when reaching up high on the post to scratch, hind legs often get up onto the wide base of the post. The base of the post is smooth so that hind paws slip with no grip and the stretch feels uncomfortable and unstable. Carpet or other grip coating on the top of wide base would make for a much more stable hind paws for those long high scratchings."

152481,0,"We have been using this system for about 9 months for our labs and it worked up until Christmas day when our dog stopped traffic on a busy highway because his collar stopped working. When we retrieved him from the highway patrol the first thing we noticed was that three of the four screws on his collar receiver were gone, so the box was hanging partially open and was very wet inside since it was raining that day. The night before when we took his collar off for the night, it was completely in tact with all screws in place. We kept our dogs in their pen or in the house for the next two days. At that point I thought his collar receiver may have dried out and while I was waiting for the replacement screws I replaced the battery and tested it out. No go, blinked once or twice and dead. At that point I took the receiver box from our other dog's collar and attached it to his collar (bigger neck), tested it, and all was working well. We still kept the dogs with us at all times for the next day. That night my husband opened the back door to the let the dogs out to do their business at about 10pm on our 5 acres that is surrounded by the in-ground fence wire. A few minutes later he called for them to come in and only one returned. Our boy was gone again. We spent the next hour with me stationed at the nearest freeway on ramp and my husband driving around our neighborhood and checking back at the house. My husband followed the scent of a skunk and found our dog about a mile from our house. When he arrived home and prepared to bathe him, he removed the collar and again three screws were missing! It was also raining that night, so another collar probably bites the dusk. At least our dog is okay and no one was hurt, well, except and unhappy skunk. But, now we are faced with forking out another $150 for new collars because the screws appear to just fall out. Keep in mind we had only opened the battery compartments twice - once to initially install a battery and again at 6 months when we replaced the batteries to insure that we didn't have a battery failure issue. I used a manual screwdriver each time, so the screws were not stripped, but in firmly. We had never had a problem before and handled the collars daily when we took them off for the night. We invested a fair amount of money in this system, actually purchasing two complete systems, so that we have a back up unit, as well as multiple additional spools of wire to surround 5 acres...not to mention the dr bills for the poison oak treatment for my hubby after he finished installing the wire around the property ;). I'm fearful that screws just falling out could jeopardize the entire system and put our dogs and others at risk. Check your collars daily!"
151149,0,"Regardless of whether this collar works for training and control I have 2 beefs with it. The links on mine are soooo hard to pinch to remove and replace. This is the only way to put this collar on and off if you have it sized properly. Some are made with a quick release- this one is not and was not advertised to so it does not lose points for that, but there must be some way of making the links easier to pinch. I have seen videos of how this is done and it does not look that hard. Maybe I am weak but when it is not on the dog it is not so bad but trying to pinch the 2 prongs together, line them up with the holes on an excited dog while trying not to pull it any tighter is painful for my fingers! Yes I tried the trick where you put one prong in one hole then just pinch to get the other one in but still think it is harder than it needs to be.More annoying is that you can't leave the rubber tips on the link you are using to open the collar. You could put them back on after you have the collar on the dog but it would be very difficult and then you would have to get them off before you could open the collar. This leaves one link that can not effectively have the rubber tips - maybe not a big deal but annoying! Otherwise this is a durable collar that is what it is. I wish I had gotten one with the quick relase closure and may end up with one of those soon."

98779,1,"We've had this for over a month now for our guinea pigs. It comes with the most explicit directions I've seen on a water bottle. As other reviewers noted, you need horizontal bars (2) at the correct distance apart to hang this. You do need to use both hangars or it leaks. We always fill the bottle full of water (never partially full), and when you invert it to hang, it does squirt water and then does a slow drip while building a vacuum. If we're lucky, one of the guinea pigs decides to drink while it's dripping, and then it stops soon after. We have a plastic container to catch drips under the water bottle, and with this water bottle, it never overflows. We always had problems with the previous two (smaller) water bottles that would slowly drip over a couple of days and fill up the container and get everything wet. I'd give it five stars but it does need the horizontal bars and it does get stuff wet when you initially hang it."
103807,0,"I wanted something for my dog and didn't want to spend a lot of money on it. This is kind of expensive for the material. The fabric is just cheap, I'm planning on making something waterproof one day. The sponge seat is just a big sponge and I'm sure that doesn't cost that much. But I guess I have no other choice since there aren't many pet car seat to choose from.I got small since it's good for dogs up to 18 lbs. I have a mini schnauzer and he's 14 lbs now, but I don't think he will grow much anymore since both of his parents are only 10 lbs. But this car seat is kind of small for my dog. I don't know how any 18lb dog can fit in it. He can sort of lay down but not like the picture. There's no way he can be in this seat like the picture. Either he has to sit, or he has to stand diagonally, or he has to curl up in it. I'm still going to use this though.Now I think about it, I think it would be better if they also had the dimensions of inside of the seat."

They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath."

44318,2,"I was really excited about this product before I actually got it. Cats naturally prefer moving water (like drinking from the faucet) over still water (like their pristine water bowl you just filled). However, the design is seriously flawed. The water and filter chambers have little niches and indentations which are virtually impossible to clean without running the unit through the dishwasher (and who wants to do that daily?). A layer of slime builds up on the inside within a few days, reminiscent of algae in a pond (yum!) The filter compartment traps food and fur so it's not in the bowl, but all the remaining water gets pushed through the collected gunk, which means all the water tastes bad. Definitely not useful for leaving the cat by himself over the weekend, because he won't drink water that tastes bad, even if he is the one who got the food and fur in it."

I agree with others that the motor is less than perfect. Mine sometimes doesn't pump initially, but it'll work if I unplug it and plug it back in. If the motor is noisy (we have a tile floor) it usually helps to unplug it briefly and/or shift its position slightly. I tried a folded towel as someone suggested and it helped but it was one more thing to clean. Speaking of cleaning, I give it a rinse-out once or twice a week and it's been fine. So although there's room for improvement I've been satisfied with it, and my cats certainly are!"

174190,1,"The Dental Kong with a rope is a great toy for dogs who like to chase things and chew on them. And that includes most dogs. This toy sort of simulates say a small pray animal that dogs normally would chase. I throw it and my dog chases after it. When she gets it she shakes it around vigorously like a dog would do if it caught say a rabbit and then chews on it. The ropes are easily chewed threw by heavy chewers in a short period of time but the rope is made of cotton so there is no danger if the dog ingests small pieces of the rope. And the Kong Company sells replacement ropes with instructions for tying the special knots at each end for a nominal charge and they don't charge anything for shipping them. Don't be tempted to use replacement ropes made of anything but cotton, nylon or polypropylene for example from other sources, as this material will harm your dog if ingested.I would give this dog toy five stars if the ropes lasted longer but that is the only shortcoming in this terrific toy and I really don't see how the toy could have the appeal it does for my dog without the rope."

I had to use a wrench on one occasion ~ that one was returned. These DO rust as the mounting part is not made of stainless steel so keep that in mind if you are using near or for water. I have some plastic crate cups that work much better, however they cost a lot more money. For the price on these, it is a decent value. Be prepared to return for an exchange if you order this. It is a crap shoot if you will or will not get one that is hard to unscrew and mount."
212614,0,"We bought this for our fairly calm golden retriever and it worked well until he figured out that it was worth the mild shock to get to the interesting smells beyond the fence. At first we felt guilty that we would ""hurt"" him with the shock, so tested it on ourselves and it really is about the same feel as when you shock yourself with static electricity -- uncomfortable but no pain. After a few weeks of him running the fence, we lost our fear of hurting him and ordered the ""stubborn"" dog collar (which I thought of for more pit bull/german shepherd dogs, not this teddy bear of a retriever.) Despite having to buy 2 collars now (actually 3 because he somehow got off and chewed up the first), I am thankful to Petsafe for providing a more economical route of electric fence than the big companies who only offer a total package with installation. Am hoping that the stubborn collar works better. Also like it that the stubborn collar works with 9V batteries that we can find at drugstore rather than having to special order ones."

83411,1,"My biggest concern when buying a dog crate was finding a good quality crate that was big enough for my 100 Lb doberman. I already owned two black wire crates for my other dogs (and I thought they were very good quality,) but they were given to me, so I don't know what brand they are. I read many reviews for other crates saying that they were flimsy and arrived bent. The Midwest Life Stages had very few claims of bent crates, so I decided to go with it. It arrived in perfect condition, took some prying to get one of the sides up, and is perfect! There is also a latch to keep the heavy plastic tray from sliding out. Boomer seems likes it and it is definitely big enough. He is 100 pounds, but not overweight at all, so he's a pretty tall boy. I will never buy another brand."

I finally splurged on the Litter Robot and love it. It works perfectly, and even though it costs $300, you don't have to buy any special contianers like the Litter Maid, and it's also extremely frugal with litter. Over the long run I believe the Litter Robot is actually less expensive. Believe me, just save yourself time and money and get the Litter Robot."
192319,0,"Our golden retriever is the worst combination of dog: massive chewer and smart. By smart, I mean rocket science smart. I thought we had come upon the perfect toy for him. He was licking and biting at the treat and it was great. He had something to do and it seemed the treat would last forever. That's when he figured out a better way to get the treat. He figured out if he could pull the rubber off the edge around the treat, he could get the whole treat out. He set out to do that so we were taking big rubber pieces out of his mouth. Still thinking the treat was pretty solid in there, we let him have it back. Soon he had the whole disk of the treat in his mouth! We added a treat to the other side a week later and he set out to dismantle that side. Our dog opens gates and figures things out very easily so this toy was no match for his genius, but evil, smarts or crazy chewing skills. He just happens to be able to figure out angles to achieve his goals so this toy was a fail for us. I think it's a great toy for most dogs and the treat should last a long, long time for hours of fun. If your dog isn't such an evil genius or a huge chewer of rubber, then it would be a great toy."

107709,1,"With two dogs of our own and occasional visiting dogs, we've always had at least two leashes. The Flexi leash has outlasted at least three other leashes of various brands going on ten years now.It's a well made product of Germany that has withstood the ravages of weather and pulling, rambunctious dogs.Originally I bought this for our bathroom shy Evie so she could have some distance when I took her to the large field across the street. If she was too close to me she wouldn't go unless I turned my back and looked the other way.The leash has two locking mechanisms, one that fixes the leash at a certain length and one that is a thumb controlled brake that I use to pull the dog towards me when a car, human, or another dog approaches us. Releasing the thumb returns the leash cord to a flexible mode.In ten years and maybe thousands of walks, the leash has never jammed, never failed to retract.For wild, energetic dogs like our Gabby, a shorter leash length is advisable. For her I am using a nine foot retractable that gives her a little bit of roaming room but not too much. Many dog trainers insist that your dog must walk beside or behind you. I don't subscribe to such restrictions and allow my dogs to explore and enjoy the exciting outdoor scents.With the retractable leash one has the option to keep the leash short when circumstances require more control of the dog."

I was so disappointed with the change in the quality. The pads were so much thinner that they have a sheer look. It is so obviously that they were not as thick which affected the absorbancy. I no longer use Nature's Miracle."

And like I said, I've had a number of these, and the cat will either break the cord or wire that is attached to the doorway will come flying, taking down anything in it's path. We usually just leave it up if we are watching, but take the bird off for her to carry around the house. When it turns into a yellow piece of fluff that she carries around, I'm compelled to buy a new one for her. I've tried to spark her interest in other toys, and even in a look-alike stuffed with catnip -- but she is totally uninterested until I pull one of these out of the box.

35698,0,"We have a hyper-active I-must-go-first pulling lab and the gentle leader has been the only thing that helped to be in some control over his energy. He absolutely hates the gentle leader, and I can now understand why. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop him from pulling which results in the straps getting tighter and tighter around his nose. Then, he starts rubbing his nose everywhere, including bushes, his people, ground, etc. Well, a couple of days ago, I discovered a very bad open sore on the side of his face, just where the strap goes over. It's been very hot this summer, and he's been panting non-stop, in which case the strap gets tighter around his face because the mouth is open all the time. Nylon is a very rough fabric and can cause burns from constant rubbing. Please note that we have been using the gentle leader for a couple of years now and we switch to a new one when the plastic parts get loser and make it impossible to adjust the straps. The gentle leader that caused the wound is relatively new, probably a month or so old. In conclusion, this is not a perfect solution, and you need to keep checking if your dog has any sores/wounds if he/she starts to really dislike it. And we learned our lesson - it's best to invest time into training our dog rather than into fancy leashes."

I wouldn't rec for anyone with a dog over 5lbs or not seriously arthritic. If you need to confine your dog while you're at work or to protect areas during potty training this is not it! We use it just to keep all the doggie toys, bed & what not contained to one area. She does consider it home but it's not secure."

When putting it on him, he will stretch his nose upward extending his neck so I have a difficult time closing it. once it is on he seems fine. He does not try to rub it off and he walks great with it. We have been going on nice long walks and he seems to enjoy them. I have mixed feelings about it though. I love how easy it is to walk with him now, but really wish he didn't hate it so much. I'm almost afraid it will affect his house breaking."
149563,2,"Really? This item works for some people? My dog has fleas, my home is mostly carpeted. This item is a night light perched above very sticky paper. I saw this product and thought it would be a good indicator of the presence of fleas in the house. We went away for 6 days and I left it plugged in where our dog usually sleeps. When we came home all that was trapped on the sticky paper was an ant.I guess the light/warmth is supposed to attract the fleas? I have been vacuuming constantly. I tried diatomaceous earth, I tried spraying the carpet, I tried flea powder in the carpet.BTW do not buy flea powder over the internet from Amazon, the packages arrived damaged and unusable. Although Amazon finally make good, it was an unnecessary hassle. For the dog I tried to knock down with Capstar then gave him Advantage. Later I tried Comfortis. We are still suffering from fleas. He is bathed every other day and now not allowed to run in our fenced in back yard. We now walk him. I feed a 2 stray cats outside which I also gave Capstar and Advantage. There is a raccoon which I guess must still be carrying the fleas, because I have put granules on the yard and sprayed the yard. As you can see we are under siege from the fleas and it is making everyone's life more difficult. I have had the flea trap plugged in constantly for 2 weeks now and caught nothing other than the ant and a few hairs. My dog still is suffering from fleas. This is a night light perched above sticky paper. Does it really work for some people because I know I have fleas in my home but this trap has not caught even one? I will be returning it as soon as I find a suitable box."
121409,0,"The cat feeder works as advertised and is reliable. However, what they don't advertise is that the electronic timer can only be set in fixed increments of time (e.g. 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours). What this means is that if you want the unit to feed your pet at noon, you must set it at either 8 that morning, 8 pm, 4 pm or noon the previous day. If you have multiple cats, you need multiple units, unless the cats are willing to share eating in the same space (mine aren't). So, for multiple cats, you not only need to remember to start the units at the appropriate time so that feeding occurs at the desired time, but you must also turn on all of the units at the same time to synchronize the opening of all at the same time."

Unlike the other reviewers though, these balls haven't popped or fallen apart while my dog played with them.My biggest problem with these tennis balls is that she's indifferent to them. I noticed right out of the package that they didn't have any peanut butter scent, and I guess my dog can't smell them either. I've purchased other scented/flavored tennis balls for her before - including some other peanut butter ones she went nuts for. That's the whole reason I bought these, so it's a little disappointing that they're not a ""treat"" for her. We do still play with them, but at my house they're just overpriced tennis balls."
34001,1,"You get your money's worth, and if you have a dog that is an aggressive eater this is a must. Stores and extends easily. I highly recommend it."
94674,2,"This collar worked for my lab initially, so I actually ordered a second one for my much smaller corgi. The strap is very adjustable so it fit both dogs fine. Soon after I received my 2nd collar, the first one pretty much stopped working. It would make a click like it was going to spray but then wouldn't. This problem was solved on a few occasions by shaking the device, but within another week or so it was totally toast. The 2nd collar lasted about the same amount of time, 2 weeks. It worked great on my dogs when, well, it worked...but that was not very long. I would not spend money on this product again."

60229,0,I have a German Shepherd Dog. Frontline seemed to control most but not all the fleas. Maybe it was just a bad year for fleas.
180669,1,"My buns loved these mats! Digging on them, chewing on them, throwing them, and eating them. They last for a long time, even with my German Giant / Angora mix tearing these up daily. We bought several for him and they were always something we could buy we knew he would enjoy having in his cage or in his favorite spot to hang out."
210027,0,"The squeaker makes a grunting noise, which is cute, but the type of squeaker is one that doesn't last long as it relies on a plastic baggie to hold air (easily punctured) and make a sound. I think my main disappointment is it is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. To me, this is a medium/large size toy."
100215,2,My English Cocker Spaniel took this apart in minutes. Not a good toy if your dog has a habit of taking soft toys apart.
90473,0,"I have a decent sized pond and I thought this thing would help with some of the sludge. The bag was hard to clean. It really is better for larger, hard to reach items, like leaves and such."
106034,1,"Reasonably priced, healthy & all natural, low-calorie. They're small and easy to chew, so they are great for training sessions. They're also not too stinky or greasy, like lots of other dog treats, which makes the training sessions easier and less messy! And the best part - my dog adores them!!"
15056,0,I have purchased many dog collars but purchased this one to save a little money. It worked well as the dog was quiet but she soon was back to barking. I verifed that baby was still working. My Beagle/Jack Russel Terrier mix is very much in the stubborn dog class. I would reccomend this product for many dogs but just not for my pooch.I will buy the collar that I used to purchase which is the PetSafe PDBC-300. Or thats the type of one I used to buy before from Petsafe.
168009,1,I ended up not needing the food since my fish passed on just after I ordered it. The customer service was great and they gave me a refund without any problems. Very prompt service as well.
135181,1,"This shampoo does work. My dog is parti color with a base of white. I have noticed a difference in the whiteness of his coat when using this shampoo as directed verses other shampoos. However, you have to follow the directions and leave the shampoo on the dog for a few minutes before rinsing or you do not get the results."
199416,0,"Not too excited about this product. It seems to rip the hair off the animal. I used it on a dog and also on a cat. It seems to work okay, but it takes ""forever"" to take off enough hair to make a significant difference. It is a long and tedious process, and I have never finished deshedding any animal because of this. If you have patience, it may be a good product for you."
99809,2,After finding the code numbers were not the same on both package and applications I chose not to give this. The articles I read on fake products was scary.
211744,0,"I bought the lighthouse and installed it with my miracle beam led modules that I love. The lighthouse though I was less impressed with. It looks really cool... but on the side of the box was a warning not to look directly at the laser. This makes it very hard to watch the fish if you have to keep looking away each time the laser passes by. The laser beam looks cool going around the room but I get the feeling the fish don't like it as they seem to stay above it when its on and swim away quickly when the laser passes by them. It didn't have the effect in the water that I thought it would have either. The only time it makes a beam appear is when it is pointed directly at you, and that is when you are not supposed to look at it. I feel it would have been a better product if they would have used an led instead of a laser for the beam. Also I wonder, since it says it kills bacteria, if it might kill the bacteria that is benificial for fish also. I unplugged it.. it still looks cool with the mirror rotating, but I won't reconnect it for more than a few minutes in the future."
213851,2,"I like the idea of the collar and the ""handle"" works well however the collar frays so much in a short period of time. I also have the leash but have had no problem with it."
83470,1,We needed a crate large enough for our basset hound.The door on the front works great for in house or car(hard to turn corners with long dog). We are very happy with the quality & workmanship.
102054,2,"I am a long time user of Bags on Board refills. This time, the bag seems to have been redesigned to include some sort of ties. Tearing the bag is problematic, and two bags of my first roll tore off with the bag's seams completely torn. So, I could not use two bags in first batch. Sticking with the old design, a plain rectangle bag works best. I wish I knew of this new design before purchasing this product."
98074,2,"The retractable action on this flexi leash is not strong enough, often causing a delay or sagging of the cord when you want it to take up some slack. This makes walking my dog extremely tedious, and dangerous. I also use a lightweight rubber extension to cushion the impact of a 'strong walker' (dog that pulls hard or makes a break for a rabbit, bird, etc.), and this flexi leash cannot handle it. The sagging occurs whether I use the extension or not, but is much worse with the extension. Flexi should manufacture these retractable leashes with a stronger springing action to make them more functional in the real world. I am hoping my pet retailer will take it back and refund me."
18447,0,I bought this to feed my seven chicks. It works with a narrow necked mason jar. It is messy to fill. I have to empty the base and turn it over to screw onto the jar of food. My chicks fill it up the holes with bedding. It hasn't tipped over. I have to refill it once a day.
189224,1,"We love this carseat! This is our 2nd Snoozer purchase. We have theSnoozer Console Lookout Car Seat, Black, Smallfor our 6 pound dog and got this lookout seat for our new 14 pound dog. In fact, my husband got this one for me for Christmas (after getting our 2nd dog in November) and it was one of my favorite gifts! Both dogs LOVE their seats and hop right in them when they run to the car. We are able to use the seats in either our car or my husband's truck. We just took a 2 1/2 hour trip pulling our trailer and both dogs rode happily in their seats. Although some people might think car seats for dogs are silly, it's not just about pampering your pet (although they do feel pampered with these), it's about safety!!! My little 6 pounder would gladly sit in my lap, but I know that if an airbag went off (even in a minor collision), she would not survive. We are able to take the dogs with us much more easily with these seats!"
73652,1,"This is a great stuffed toy for dogs who tend to get a little over zealous with stuffed toys. I have all three of Fat Cat's 'Yanker' toys (Aligator, Snake and Fish) and they are pretty indestructable. My corgi loves to play with stuffed toys, but he also loves to rip them apart. Most average toys are gutted and destroyed within the first day of play-These will last for sometimes several months and some (like the snake) will last for years. My corgi adores these, as he can play to his heart's content, and the fish is by far his favorite. Yes, sometimes a dog can catch a seam in the right way and pop a little of it open, usually about an inch or two, they can be repaired, but it really will only stay you off until you can find a replacement.This is why I can't give the toy a five star rating. Still, as stuffed toys go, these are the only toys I can feel okay about spending money and know that my dog will have a great stuffed toy to play with for more than a day or two."
67354,1,The merchandise was great and the response time in shipping was very good. Thank you
159768,0,I've had it all of an hour & the screw for the battery compartment broke off(without trauma). Hope this is not an indicator of it's performance. I have not got to test the Anti- bark at nothing function yet. I will ammend this after that...Update: It's useless. Does nothing except irritate me cause...I CAN HEAR IT!
99100,1,"Worked well on our little Yorkie, Had congestive heart failer and could not hold her bladder due to the meds! We did have to put on harness to keep them on her. You can buy the harness seperatly, but they did the job. Sadly she passed away after we bought thease we miss her so much!!"
29960,2,"Even when there is nothing in the litter box, there is dust in the air and an awful smell to go with it. The smell is the litter - nothing else. Swheat scoop (?) wheat litter is so much better. I can't even finish the box of this litter. Bought it because it was the only thing available at a small natural store and I was in a hurry. Won't make that mistake again!"
24622,2,"I bought and returned 3 of these in one week. The first one never bubbled, the second one bubbled for 10 mins and the third one bubbled for 3 minutes. The valve and hose attachment is poorly designed and cracks when the bubbler is assembled. The pet store where I bought this said they are constantly returned and suggested another type of pet fountain. Save yourself the return postage and look at another brand."
182475,2,"My dog loved playing with this toy, however it is very dangerous to your pets safety. The toy has a small hole at each end and is solid in the middle so when the dog chews on it, it creates suction that can pull your dogs tongue into the little hole at the end. The tongue then gets stuck in the toy. It happened to my dog and fortunately I was there to remove it which was very difficult. I had to cut it off without injuring the dog. The vet said that had I not been there to remove it, the dogs tongue would have become swollen inside of the toy and if it had remained on for any extended period, there was a good chance that the tongue would of had to been amputated. If you are buying chew toys, always make sure there are at least two holes in each side of the toy, which prevents suction pulling the tongue into the toy. This toy has two holes, however it is blocked by solid rubber in between. This item should be recalled, but there is no such thing for dog toys. Always be careful with what your dog plays with when you are not home. Beware of this item!"
104986,2,this wheel is so noisey it sques so much also it cuts though its self as it is used because of a plastic covering i would not buy this product agnian
1514,2,"my 8 month old pit bull puppy broke out of the side of this (not even one of its two doors - he got out the side). I really wish I could find a better made crate because he has severe separation anxiety, even for 10 minutes, and we have to go to work like normal people. He is absolutely not ready to be left home alone."
59978,2,Product is not working. Had to reapply after 21 days. My dogs are going crazy with ticks galore. Will never buy this product again.

83360,0,"The cage is easy to assemble and also conveniently folds down for easy carrying. However, the cage needs modifications if you have a large, energetic dog. My dog (lab mix ~50 lbs) was able to push the door out and bend it down in order to get out. I had to zip tie the sides together so that was not possible for him to do any more. Also, the cage comes with two handles that you can put wherever you like for carrying it. One of them broke one me because I was trying to put it on one of the wires that was too thick for it. So make sure you are careful when you are putting those on."
24542,2,this system has worked great for my boston terrior. Unfortunally I have had to replace two colars at $70.00 a pop within the last two years and need a new one again. Bottom line is the colars break easy and you will have to invest money to keep your system working.
132488,0,"I'm giving this three stars for now because I haven't gotten to use it very much, and the several times I did, I had mixed results. Like other reviewers, I had some trouble putting the battery in, but my battery case has not popped off (yet).Yes, dogs DO notice when you use this product, but they don't necessarily stop barking. I purchased and carry it to and from work after a few too many incidences of (big) dogs coming up to me and trying to jump on me - I was never attacked, but I really don't appreciate anyone's poorly trained beast coming near me. It was particularly useful in making a dog that would growl at me from the other side of a chain link fence run away whimpering...however, the next time I saw that dog (about two months later), it became enraged upon setting eyes on me - all I did was cross the street and use the sidewalk. Man, I thought that dog was going to jump over the fence and and kill me! It ran along the fence barking, snarling, and baring its fangs the whole time I walked on that part of the sidewalk. The Repeller didn't make the dog stop or go away at all, although the other dog in the yard ran back to the house away from me without barking.I've used this on yappy, annoying dogs that bark and follow people as they pass on the sidewalks as well, and it didn't work; at times, they'll pause and resume barking, or they seem to get more agitated. So I am not sure if the reason it doesn't work is the product itself or the dogs. When I bought this, I understood that this was not a fail-proof way to keep dogs from barking at me or trying to come near me/jump on me, but I did not expect that using the Repeller would cause a dog to go into attack mode. This product would probably work better if it was used in conjunction with a handgun for the dogs that still pose a threat to people and their pets. In my honest opinion, dogs will not stop being a nuisance or a public danger until they are properly trained by responsible owners who will be their masters and not their parents."
7473,0,"I got this because of my little dog trying to get treats from the litter box. Initially it worked well, though one of my cats wouldn't use it with the lid on (my dog was still unable to get into the litter). However, then when I took over care of a rottweiler, even with the cover on it provided no protection from litter box diving. If you have a small dog, and a flexible cat, this product will work wonderfully. If your cat is inflexible, and the dog is large, keep looking."
198561,0,"If i had read a little more carefully i would have noticed that connections to this product are solvent weld not threads. If i were advertising this product i would make sure to specify that fact and to point out that the threads are NOT iron pipe (NPT). Service,product and delivery very good."
23009,1,"The Furminator comb is wonderful! It works great! It removes the undercoat of the cats so they don't shed as much. Much less fur on the sofa, chairs and carpet."
120575,0,My dogs are full bred labs 9 and 11 years old and I give them this everyday with their food. A 2.5lb amount will last a long time. My main beef with this is that you can get it direct from Gateway for 20.00 shipped. 16.09 shipping from this seller?? Come on. Glad I found a better deal.
73297,1,Always a useful product to have avilable when clipping dog or cat nails. Works fine and this size should last for years for the average pet owner.

14583,0,The advantix for dogs 21-50 lbs worked fast removing most fleas. But a week or so later there still were some fleas still annoying my dog.
210182,1,"I purchased this at first because it looked like the expensive ropes for sale at the local pet store.mMy little guy will chew forever. I keep the bag in a ziploc so they stay fresh. All his doggy friends love them as well. Great price, great product"
48538,2,Batteries last 2 days. Don't waste your money. PetSafe is a ripoff anyway. I'll try fido's fences version. Worthless peices of chit.
149286,1,"No, this should not be your front-line defense against fleas, but as other reviewers stated, it's a great adjunct to your overall flea arsenal. It caught about a dozen fleas during a bad infestation this summer. Any any dead flea is a good thing."
157549,2,"I bought this door from one of the big box stores because it was the only one I could find and it was priced right. I move a lot so I have a lot of experience with installing dog doors. The installation for this door is ""Average"" it's going to take some time but no major design flaws in my book. However, this is a weak door and you get what you pay for. The slightest breeze and the door would open 3-4 inches, letting heat, cold and unwanted critters to come as they please. The magnets are very weak and even if i manually ""shut"" the door it would open with the wind or when my dog used it. I think this would be a fine door on a dog house or maybe even for a garage or barn but I would not recommend it for entrance into a home. We finally bit the bullet and shelled the big bucks for a freedom pet pass door. Nothing but good things to say about the door - still hurting over the cost."
16439,0,"The product wasn't defective, it just didn't work on my pet. I bought it to keep my cat away from the dog door, but the shock had no effect on her (I know it was working, I tried it on my self!) Maybe she has too much fur blocking the contacts from her skin. I'd imagine it's a good product as long as your pet can feel and responds to the shocks."
132313,1,i got this for my dog because she just doesn't like to listen... and it's great... because it's not a barking collar that just goes off when she barks... this collar let's me let her know when she's doing wrong... and you can adjust the settings to how little or big of a shock you want to give each time... plus now i don't even have to put the collar on her if she just sees me holding the remote she calms down... i'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but it made me happy
132193,1,"This trainer was certainly worth the money! I have a very intelligent but hard-headed 23lb min. schnauzer who would tend to leave our yard even when being called. We put off buying any type of training aid for over 6 months because of price and the fence was not an option because we did not want to limit him to a small area. Our frustration of having to chase him through the neighbors' yards put us over the edge. I have had this less than a week and used no initial training whatsoever. After correcting him twice on the lowest setting, anytime I warn him, he comes running. The only problem now is he shys away when I try to put the collar on him. I am sure after a few more times he will learn that it won't correct him as long as he minds.Great product!!"
187827,0,"The ShedEnder is ok. I don't see too much difference between it and a wire brush except a wire brush doesn't have to be cleaned 52 times per pet side. The ShedEnder seems to hold 4 hairs and need to be cleaned before the next 4 hairs can be ""brushed"" out. Yes it produces a ball of hair after 4 hours of brushing but it just seems a little long to spend brushing out a pet. And since the product doesn't actually STOP the shedding the name really doesn't fit. I can see the appeal but I don't think it's worth more than $5. Good thing I got this as a gift.. I'd be mad if I paid $14.99"
34199,0,"Size large would not fit around my bulldog. Measurment accounts from length of head to tail, not width. It looks cool but tophat is useless and flat. The large would not fit on my 45lbs. boxer puppy either and he is still pretty skinny. Outfit must be made for very small dogs."
13674,0,"These work great, but make sure to put in your order well in advance from needing them, this company takes forever to ship out. Also horrible communication ..I emailed for a status on the order and never heard back from them.."
194415,1,"Great toy. This is the second one we have got because it Is our dogs favorite toy. This first one is wearing out after two years of constant paying and it still squeaks. She plays with both the new and old. This is the only toy our dog has had that the squeaker still works, she usually distroys them in most toys in a matter of minutes."
11285,2,"The dogs love the everlasting products, but this flavor left red stains all over my light carpet."
27527,2,"Purchased this toy for my small dog. Within 5 min. he had managed to destroy the squeaker. Thinking this might have been a defective squeaker, I replaced it with the extra one that came with the toy. He destroyed that one also in less than 5 min. The squeakers must be very cheaply made. Very disappointing purchase! Will not purchase another KONG toy with squeaker. Don't waste your money on this toy."
68359,1,"My dog loves these treats. He's really picking with his treats so it says a lot that he loves these. I had been buying him bags of the freeze dried treats at petco, etc. and it was costing a fortune, not to mention they were smashed. These are great quality. You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love."
60345,2,Like many other reviewers I found this product ineffective. After three weeks and two vials there is no visible reduction in my dog's flea infestation. Please read the many recent reviews that support this before you buy.
164052,1,"I have a cat who refuses to come indoors, even in the worst weather. She just toughs it out, laying in her favorite spot (the doormat). It's been unseasonably cold (deep freezes) here in Georgia this winter, so I ordered the heating pad, hoping to give her some warmth. All I had to do was plug it in. She absolutely LOVES it. It's been hours, and she hasn't moved an inch! I can certainly rest easier this winter.Other notes: it's quite large (the cat in the photo must be a BIG CAT) - there's room enough for two. The cord seems very chew-proof. I love the fact that I can hose it off to clean it. All around a good buy."
119335,0,"I have a 9-year-old Mastiff that still prefers chasing her giant ball around the yard to sleeping all day. I bought her first Jolly Ball when she was still quite young and since, I've had to purchase two more. Three balls in the span of six years. The last ball I got for her was about six months ago. She chewed that thing into oblivion in record time. She has chewed away nearly half the ball. It now sits in the back yard like a bowl (when she's not carrying it around, that is). She still loves the thing though and I'm afraid to purchase another knowing she'll likely just chomp away at that one too. Now that she's an expert, I bet she'd have a new one ravaged in a few short months.I've given this a 3 star review because a) my dog loves this product (she doesn't care for any other toy I've ever given her), b) when it's still in full form, it's actually quite enjoyable for myself as well (easy to kick/toss around the yard), and c) the price is very decent (I've seen 50 dollar balls exclaiming they are made for ""chewers"" but I'm afraid to put down that kind of money when I know what my dog is capable of).I will note that once my dog created a hole large enough for her to pick up the ball, she was slightly less inclined to chew constantly at it. It didn't stop the process entirely, however, hence the crescent moon shaped ball in my backyard."
49508,1,"Can't complain, doesn't cost too much and it seems to work. Teeth are small enough to field through the hair, I can see from it picking up even dry skin. My cat doesn't complain either."
61352,2,The new LME9000 Mega Advanced Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box is a piece of JUNK. I bought it when our regular old one gave out--we had it for over three years. The old one was great. This one does not clean the box and it will not stop running until I turn off the switch. Do not waster your money on it.
51433,1,Cats go crazy for this product - and it's all natural and good for them.
37617,2,"Please do not buy this toy! It is fun and the cat loves it very much! But it will tangle and will choke the kitty. If I wasn't home, my kitten would've choked because it got warped around his neck! Because it is a string, it will tighten itself and the more kitty struggles to get it off the more pressure is places on the tangled body part! Please spare your kitty's life and do not buy this! I cut the string off right there and then and threw it out! Be very cautious with this and do not let the kitty play with it alone!"
167835,0,"the scooper and the enzymes did not come in the box as promised. all i received was the septic tank, which is very difficult to install. other than that, the product works."
46449,1,"This is a great product. I originally tried Angel Eyes and it didn't work that well. This was recommended by another Maltese owner. I tried it, and although it does take a couple of weeks it works great. I have tried so many things that have not worked. This is a great seller with great prices and fast shipping also."
139235,2,"The cat formula Urine Off is terrible. First of all, it does not get rid of the smell of urine. Second, it leaves behind the smell of a urine soaked old lady's house who is using perfume to disguise the smell of her own filth. Third, it is damn near impossible to get rid of the smell of the Urine Off.Here's a tip - use plain, old fashioned white vinegar if your cat or dog pees on the carpet. Just spray it on, let it dry, clean the area the next day with some soapy water. Repeat if necessary. The vinegar neutralises the urine - works every time. I sincerely regret ever using Urine Off; should have just stuck to the vinegar.PS - the only reason I have given it a star is because it wouldn't let me not. Zero stars from me!"

159325,0,"When we got a second labrador, the first time I tried to hold both their leashes they pulled me out into the street. I still have scars on my knees. I shouldn't have been surprised - they weigh more than I do, combined (55lbs each - small Labs, really - but I'm a pretty small human). I started dreading a future of taking two walks each time the dogs needed exercise and my husband wasn't around to take one of them.Well, the Gentle Leader meant that future never came. I can walk them by myself, and while sometimes they still pull pretty hard, I've never felt in doubt that I was the one in control. That being said, the dogs hate the Gentle Leader. All the stuff on the package about how the dogs would like it once they're used to it proved utter folly in our case. They shy away when I try to put them on, pout about having them every time they get a chance on the walk, and once I take them off at the end of the walk, they both run over to bed and start scratching their muzzles against the bed. I guess they must really itch? So, I can walk them by myself, which is fantastic - but I do feel terribly guilty putting the dogs in a harness that's so obviously uncomfortable and irritating for them.To me, if you're in a position where the choice is between this product and not walking your dog because you're afraid of being injured, trying the Gentle Leader is a no-brainer. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it, because I'm sure our dogs are not unique in hating how it feels. I only use it when my husband is away - otherwise we use a more traditional harness."
182802,0,"We have two Litter Maids, a mega and a standard. The standard size almost never jams; I think the design is slightly better (it's deeper than the mega, although it's less wide and shorter). The mega is a pain in my neck. It jams almost every day; sometimes twice a day. And deep-cleaning it is a two-to-three hour chore. However, on those special occassions the box works without jamming, it's a much better alternative than the old-fashioned way."
124500,0,"We currently had our hardwood floor installed, and I have 2 hyperactive Jack Russells who also have sharp claws. I bought 2 sets of Soft Paws after finding out from online that this was the best option to protect our floor. They worked great; although, I have decided not to use them anymore for the following reasons: 1.) If you have dogs that are partly outdoor, they come off when the dogs are running around the yard. 2.) Due to this, I decided to put more glue and really push them in. That solved the problem; however, it's been over 8 weeks and now they won't come off, and we are dealing with the problem of the claws growing into these covers, and it was making one of my dogs limp. We took her to the vet and found nothing wrong, but common sense tells us that her nail was growing into the rubber cap and had hurt her toe. 3.) They are not cheap since you will constantly be replacing them.

183368,0,"I bought these collars for my two lab mix dogs after we went through a near choking incident with them, where one dog had grabbed onto the collar of the other, it ended up getting caught on her lower jaw and twisting around the other dog's neck and cinching tighter and tighter. Unfortunately, my dogs discovered with their new collars that if they pulled hard enough, they would come off, so it became their new game when they would play out in the back yard. They pulled them off so much that the safety clasp would barely hold anymore. They also chewed on the regular buckle which made it impossible to open the regular way. I have gone through two sets of these collars now, and as much as I think they are great products, they just don't work with my dogs. The last one I bought lasted all of one day. I think if you had one rather easy-going dog, it would be fine. They just don't hold up to the chewing/playing power of two lab/retriever mix dogs."

119850,2,"I really wanted to give this product a nice rating and review, because my children's python has done so well with the small size. It was durable, easy to clean, and a good price. But I can't. She's now outgrown the small size which served me so well, so I ordered the medium size, expecting the same quality and durability. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. The first time it arrived the lip that holds the lid on was cracked, broken, and crumbling in several places. I exchanged it, and the replacement has just arrived. I was disappointed to find that this time the lid had a small chip out of the bottom of it, and the inner paint appears to be peeling. I'm just going to sand down the sharp edge and the peeling paint so they're not an issue to my reptile and use this one rather than exchange again, but I'm bitterly disappointed at such poor quality in what was in the past such a fine product.Part of the problem seems to be the packaging. Not amazon's packaging, which is done very well, but the disintegrating styrofoam and the careless way the two pieces are placed right against each other in the product's box. However, from the cracks and crumbling pieces and the peeling paint, I can tell it's not all packaging. The product seems poorer quality and more fragile than in the past. It's thin and somewhat brittle, and from the other not so glowing reviews I've read, I can see I'm not the only one to experience this. I can see now why none of my local pet supply stores stock them. I don't know if this has just been a bad batch or if they've changed something lately that has lowered the quality, but either way, it is a subpar product, and I think in the future I might just try to find a similarly designed equivalent product with a better record of quality.I really was hoping this product would be as wonderful as the small size version I bought 2 years ago, but it's not, and I don't think I would recommend this product to other reptile owners after this experience. When proper quality, this product is a wonderful humid hide that's easy to clean, affordable, durable, and comfortable for a reptile, but with such high chances of receiving this product damaged or brittle enough to damage soon after arrival, I would think twice about ordering this again.EDIT: After further inspection I noticed another chip missing from the bottom lip that holds the lid on. That was the last straw. I'm returning the second one and just getting a refund this time rather than risking receiving another damaged or poor quality product."

212795,0,"A bird stand is quite convenient for parrot owners to have (my babies can now come with me to the living room while I'm washing dishes/doing crunches/other miscellaneous activities), but this particular stand isn't exactly the ideal.For starters, the box doesn't have assembly instructions for those of us that are retarded when it comes to assembling/building anything; but despite that, it was pretty easy to assemble, for the most part.Also, the stand is more ideal for medium sized parrots - for instance, African Grays, or Sun Conures - which wasn't clear from Amazon's description of the dimensions and size. Although it DOES suffice for my Green-Cheeked Conure and Cockateil, the wooden bar is a bit too large, and the closely placed cups a tad bit too tall; subsequently, feeding or drinking from the stand's side cups often entails some pretty entertaining acrobatics (well, for me to watch).My final complaint is that the stand's parts aren't very high quality (i.e. it's cheaply made), nor is it sturdy or stable.Overall, it's nice because it's convenient, but I think the $40 would be better spent at a local store where you can get a sense of what the end product is, rather than online."

I put peanut butter in the grooves and small holes, which kept my hyperactive goffins busy for hours. I was also glad that they didn't splinter in the dogs mouth like other wood toy parts can (my 3 cockatoos all like to feed the dog and shove toy parts thru their cages to him, so bird toys also being dog-safe is a real concern for me).I'm glad I bought this toy box on sale, or I would have been disappointed.Like the description says, they make great foot toys; just not good as replacement parts or for stringing your own toys."

74296,0,"This is a well built gate that serves it's purpose well. No need to sell you on that part. But, I do have three small complaints:1. The door only swings open one way. So far as I can tell, there is no way to reverse the swing, and it just so happens that the door I want it in is situated in such a way that I wish it swung the other way. And no, you can't just turn it around. I mean, you can, but then it opens to the other side, which isn't what I want.2. The cat door isn't removable. For whatever reason, my cat is not bold enough to push the little door open. So, whenever I close the gate, I have to make sure that the cat door is swung wide open. I wish I could remove it. My only option is to cut the hinges with a hacksaw, which I'd rather not do.3. The red safety latch is difficult to unlock. This may be a positive for people who are using this as an actual baby gate. However, I am only using this as a gate to keep my 70# black lab out of the office where my cat likes to hang out, and where we keep his food (so the dog won't eat it). So, I have no need for it to actually be child-proof. You can push the handle down without engaging the red latch, but I seem to be the only person in my house who has figured this out. Guests, friends, and even my wife, all seem to think it's very important to engage the latch. And seriously, it is a pain in the butt to unlatch. It requires two hands to open, which is difficult when you are carrying something.But overall, it is a well built product that is easy to set up, move, and adjust. I'm giving it three stars: 1 for not being a total POS, the second for being a unique product that fills a special, and the third for good quality construction. But the fourth and fifth starts would have required a little more thoughtfull engineering and more than just one cool feature (the cat door)."

74816,0,"I ordered this item a few months ago and it worked well for the first week. Like another reviewer, I placed the watering bowl underneath to catch the water until the auto-shutoff. The product started to work intermittently - so I replaced the batteries but it still only worked every other time I tested it. Our two labrador retrievers must have gotten frustrated when it didn't work, because we came home to find it laying on the ground chewed up. After a complex repair, we got it mounted again, only to come home the next day and find it on the ground, chewed up again. It is a great concept, but it's too easy for the dogs to work the unit loose from the pipe, and too expensive to replace each time it gets attacked. Maybe it should be made from stainless steel."

189665,2,"I bought this hammock about a year ago for my German Shepherd and I've been pretty disappointed with it. The fabric itself is holding up well, but that's the only good thing about it. After not even a month of use, the zipper broke, so now we have a permanent hole for hair and dirt to fall through, which defeats the purpose of the hammock. And even though my dog is really big, he rides calmly in the car, so he did not break the zipper. The zipper is just too small and cheap for a product like this.The grommets on the hammock are also cheap and quite thin. After a couple months of use, the fabric started tearing out of them and we had to punch in more heavy-duty grommets. Again, my dog pretty much just lays down in the car, so he wasn't bouncing around and tearing them.The headrest covers are kind of small and just barely squeeze onto the headrests in our car. The straps on the headrest covers are quite long, so we had to wrap them around a few times to keep the hammock from sagging too much. Even after that it still sags quite a bit and does not hang nearly as high as the promotional picture. And we have a Nissan Altima, so it's not a tiny car. My dog can still easily step into the front seats if he wants. It may not be such a problem for a smaller dog, but even a beagle-sized dog could easily get into the front seats with how the hammock (doesn't) fit in our car."
123800,0,"I liked the filter itself, but it was hard to put the tubing onto the fittings. So hard in fact that the quick disconnect valve was damaged on mine while I was trying to put mine together. I didn't realize it until I began running it. Then I had to return it. The other thing I didn't like was the hose clamps that are provided for the tubing. They kept popping open after I had squeezed them shut. I think they need to be a little bigger. As it was, I had to use pliers to sqeeze them shut enough so that they would stay closed. I don't think that they were really doing much anyway since the tubing was so tight on the fittings. The filter itself worked really well and ran really quietly. I really like the different options that the unit comes with for the outlet into the tank. My recommendation to anyone buying this product is to stretch the tubing opening before trying to put it on any of the fittings so that it goes on easier and far enough to put the hose clamps on. Try using pliers to close the hose clamps if it seems like they are too small. Other than those small issues I think that it is a really good filter."
29604,0,"That said, I guess it depends on your cat's taste. I desperately tried to get our cats to eat this stuff but the pellets are fairly large, so I think they hurt their mouths when they tried to eat them (one is a Persian and they typically have smaller mouths than most cats). Our ""Tom"" cat didn't care for it either for some reason. So, since we couldn't get past the taste in our house, the dental portion didn't work. Sure wish it did though. That $200 teeth cleaning bill yearly is quite ridiculous! Good luck with this but I guess it's just like any other food for cats. Try it because it is a GREAT idea but ultimately, it will be up to your cat if he/she decides to eat it."

87389,0,"While on our second set of Muttluks within the last 3 months, I can hardly believe that someone has used a single set for 4 years! Our 19 month old Cockapoo has just blasted two holes in one of her boots that we just got 21 days ago and her last set lasted less than 45 days. For us, that's about $80.00 in approx. 3 months.The fact that the boots have no right or left, front or back-paw concept yet our dog would blow holes in one boot before the others (twice!) would imply that the leather on one of the boots might be more thin or weaker than that of the others..I don't know.To their credit, the Muttluks were marvelous at keeping Willow's 'moppet feet' clean and dry (or, at least clean)...You get to the door, take them off and in she can go without dragging dirt and slop into the house. We also became quite adept at putting them on so that wasn't an issue..About 90 seconds, total.The leather soles of our first pair (size small) were slightly different than the second pair (size X-small which fit better). The smoothness of the first set, combined with our very icey conditions made Willow's first set unbelievably slippery. Again, to the company's credit, I wrote to them and, although having no answers or suggetions, simply offered to send us a new pair for free...That was pretty cool!The new set of Muttluks arrived on the very day that Willow had two holes in one of her 40-ish days old boots. The second set's more suede-like soles instantly had notibly better traction, although the smaller size was a little more challenging to put on...Still, not a big deal.We found that Muttluks stay on very well but you have to make sure that the dogs feet are in properly and that the velcro straps are properly tightened.Our bottom line is that we believe the concept of Muttluks to be excellent but feel sincere that they could (or we could) come up with a better soling material or 'after-market patch' to give them better traction and longer sole-life...An idea I posed to the company but got no reply.We're going to look into 'Neo-Paws' which are promoted as 'Dog Tennies' offering excellent traction and long wear.(A Few Days Later)Since posting the above review, we cut pieces of leather in the shape of the Muttluks boots and glued them on over the old 'holey soles' which, after 22 days of two long walks per day, had holes in 3 of the four boots. We did not attempt to cover the entire sole, just the flat base as the glue will have a hard enough time holding as it is. We used a leather-to-leather rubber cement type glue, letting them set-up for 24 hours under pressure. So-far..All is well and Willow is glad not to have her feet washed off twice a day!That's our report. Hope you approve...Willow's Dad""A Week Or So Later""Here is my latest update on Willow's Muttluks and the brand new Neo-Paws that we just got for her...No Comparison!! The 'Neo-Paws' are the most beautiful,flexible, light, super traction, water resitent and durable boots for dogs that I've ever seen! They go on ions more easily than the Muttluks and don't get stiff because there is nothing in the sole to suck up water.The vulcanized rubber soles are bouncy, quiet, extremely flexible and show absolutely no sign of wear where-as the Muttluks looked burned up after the first two days. Remember, we're the people who's 28 lb. Cockapoo burned through 2 pair of Muttluks and 2 pair of Canine Casuals in less than 3 months. The Neo-Paws are also notibly 'Left & Right' which makes tons of sense...Like shoes!Here's some 'Super Important Advice': Because Neo-Paws come in sets of 2, you measure their front paws and get the size you need and measure their back paws to do the same. Measure both front and back paws very carefully (both Length & Width) because usually their back paws are a size smaller than their front paws. We learned that lesson the hard way and are now waiting for Willow's smaller boots to come for her back paws.To be clear, we have not had the Neo-Paws long enough to give a full report. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to appreciate the genius and simple common sense in their design. On a Muttluks 'good side of town', my resoling efforts have worked well and the rubber cement that I used also worked great to patch the holes in the toe-tips of the Muttluks, (another issue resolved by the Neo-Paws)...They'll make for some good 'spares' in case we need them.At about $40 a 2 pair set, Neo-Paws are right in the ball park with them all, but far better. That's the report from ""Willow's Dad"" J.M. LohrWe are so impressed with Neo-Paws that I joined their 'Referral Team'.If you go to www.neopaws.com and like what you see, you can get a discount by useing the (Ref. Code 910472)Remember..'Measure both the 'Length & Width' of both 'Front & Back' paws to ensure a perfect fit the first time.

87704,2,"I decided to purchase a cat fountain because (i) I changed my cats water bowl twice a day and wanted something that would be a bit easier, (ii) my cat loves drinking water every day out of my hand from the bathroom sink and (iii), quite frankly, I love spoiling her and thought this would be a loving gift to her. Originally, I conducted research on the Drinkwell and Petmate fountains and decided to purchase the Drinkwell, particularly after reading about the review's on the Petmate's filters being recently changed into a cheaper version.Before the initial assembly, I cleaned all of the parts. When I started this thing, it sounded like a a pool filtration system was in my kitchen! I mean, this thing was LOUD! So, I contacted Drinkwell: they said to disassemble the motor, clean it and add some olive oil to the spining little metal rod in the motor...did that. When I started it back up, it was quieter for about five minutes...then I was back to the pool filtration system sound. So, I contacted Drinkwell again. They said to allow 24 hours for the motor to ""prime itself."" Did that, too...no change. I tried changing the speeds to the lowest it can go, to the highest it could go, to everything in the middle...still no change. This thing was so loud, that my cat wouldn't even go near it unless it was turned off! There's more...Changing the water reservoir is a NIGHTMARE! I don't care how careful you are...you're going to get water all over the place. Let me try to explain: if you have used a humidifier before, you know that the water reservoirs on those things have a ""stopper"" so you can turn the reservoir right-side up or upside-down and no water should seep out; the same holds true for those water containers you see at the work-place. This is so you remove and replace the reservoir without water spilling. There is no such stopper here!! Get this...you have to flip the reservoir a certain way OVER the Drinkwell foutain--as the DIRECTIONS say--to ""MINIMIZE"" (not ""prevent"") the spilling of the water!!! In other words, no matter how you do it, water WILL spill out! I mean...really?! This means, if it's near a wall, which I put mine and where I think most people would put it, you'll have to move the foutain away from the wall, where it will spill when removing the reservoir if there is any water in it, and then it will spill again (no doubt) when you put the reservoir back on it, and then you'll need to do some clean-up! When the reservoir is on its side, it GUSHES out! When the reservoir is the direction such that the stopper (and I use the term ""stopper"" very lightly) is on the bottom (how it goes into the fountain), it drips heavily...more likely streams of water coming out. So, you'll need to clean the water spills EVERY time you deal with the reservoir. I would not change this thing over any rug...that's for sure.The directions recommend weekly cleanings. In order to stay within the warranty, Drinkwell informed me that it must be cleaned at least once every two weeks. Speaking of warranty...it's only ONE YEAR!! Horrible!The first two issues (i.e., the loud pump and the reservoir spilling) were easily enough for me to want to return this product. However, there was a third...and I do feel that this is a cat-particular issue...meaning, one cat may find this to be an issue (like mine), and another may not: It is the free-falling water. My cat didn't like it. In fact, when my cat puts her head in the fountain pool (when it's turned off), her head would probably hit the running water...and I have a five-month old small female kitten! The Petmate (and Catmate) fountains still give the benefits of running water (i.e., the attractive sound for the cat, keeping the water cool, oxidation, etc.), but without the obtrusiveness of free-falling water.As I write this, the Drinkwell is on its way back to Amazon. In doing more research, I narrowed my alternate choices down to the Petmate Deluxe (medium size since I only have one cat) and the Catemate fountains. I ultimately chose the Petmate fountain since it has a reservoir, and the Catmate fountain does not. I wanted the ability to not have to add water all the time, which the Petmate will allow. The Catmate needs to have water added directly to the fountain and I read one review that said this person added water daily. I also feel my cat will prefer streaming water down a slide over the free-falling water.An incidental benefit to the Petmate fountain is that the Petsmart medium fountain is HALF the price of the Drinkwell ($27 versus $44).Let's now talk filters: Yes, I'm reading about complaints of the Petmate filters and how they are supposed have undergone a loss of quality with a recent ""update"" to them. For me, given the above, I'm more than willing to have this as a trade-off, IF they are in fact ""poorer"" quality than the Drinkwell filters. Of course, I won't be able to gauge this until I actually receive and set up the Petmate fountain. However, know this: in the Drinkwell directions, it states that the filters aren't even necessary for normal operation! Additionally, the Drinkwell filters are supposed to be changed (again, according to the directions), every ""4 to 6 weeks."" On the other hand, the Petmate filters are recommended to be changed (ready for this) every 60 to 90 DAYS!! So, if all is, in fact, equal, regarding the filter quality, then the Petmates last up to THREE TIMES longer than the Drinkwell filters.I currently have the Petmate fountain ordered and I really hope I don't have the same issues I did with the Drinkwell. I can then provide feedback on that foutain."

We installed this next to our recliner and she loves it. It is large enough for her to sleep on and sit comfortably. She likes the shaggy carpet on top because our house is 80% wood floor.It does include 2 screws for it to be mounted. Our sill sits out about an inch. When we installed it, it was saggy. We bridged that gap by stuffing pieces of cardboard from the box it came in behind it. You can't see it at all.Also, when she jumps on the top, air comes out of a little hole. It sounds like ""ffffffffff."" So when we hear that noise, we know she just jumped up on the seat. She is about 11 pounds and it has held up well for the past 6 months."
12653,2,This pad I ordered is very poor thin quality same as what I ordered from a different seller for less then half the price! What a rip off and the delivery shipment was very late! Yes the seller Overpriced it! I contacted the seller for return shipping and the seller wants the customer to pay for the return shipping. And the Product is not opened and still in original shipping package. Shipping cost estimate was too much! So I just keep and use it. Warning do not waste your money on this poor thin quality pad. I just want to share this to everyone before they decides to order this. Hope this save people from wasting their money.
76858,0,"I was super excited to order this product after reading the great reviews. Unfortunately, after receiving the product, I am disapointed. The pen is way too small. I have a four pound puppy, and her bed and puppy pad barely fit in the pen. I have no clue how people are squeezing labs and larger dogs into this pen. I have a larger pen made by Top Paw that is much more sturdy and spacious. I keep my puppy in the Top Paw pen during the day while I am at work, and I keep her in the Iris pen at night to sleep. Overall, this pen does look nice and is sturdy, but is a bit too small for our needs.*EDIT* After posting this review, I noticed that you could order the 4 OR 8 panel pen. I wish I would have realized this when I ordered my pen. I have purchased two more panels in hoped of making the Iris pen a bit more spacious."

If a large powerful dog like mine wants out, this kennel will not keep him from getting out, he has destroyed two doors and now the bottom half of the kennel. Unfortunately, neither will any of the other plastic airline kennels sufficiently contain this type of dog. I am looking into a foldable aluminum kennel from Kalispel.If you have a normal dog, this kennel should be fine, and costs 6 times less than the Kalispel.PS My kennel was the LARGE size."

There are some things that cannot solve all of our problems and this is one of them.The other problem I have is that my house is 100 years old and most of the outlets are horizontal, not vertical. I can't really plug this in anywhere on the first floor without some sort of adaptor, so take that into consider ation."
82807,1,I lucked out and bought this exact one at the local Goodwill for $20 in almost new condition and it works great. I especially love the double door for easy access when in my SUV and also the way it collapses for storage. If you haven't tried before it can be a bit difficult to assemble/disassemble but after you've done it once you'll become a pro at it. Great product with nice handles to carry it by.

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."

168945,0,"These are great for the aggressive chewer, but you'll need to time it if you base it on my experience. I tried the 8"" with a 75 lb american terrier, and an 8 lb toy maltese.Both are pretty aggressive chewers, but both got diahrrea from getting to about half the bone. (I tried 8"" for pit bull and 4"" for maltese).Limit it's intake and you should be fine.They DO entertain for what I'd say is good, which is an hour. If your pet is to be confined, unwatched, or crated for over an hour, I'd say use a Nylabone or other bone for aggressive chewers."
194635,0,My puppy loved to play with this toy but it only lasted a week and a half so I'm not sure if it was worth it. It came with a replacement ball which was nice. Maybe my puppy was just too rough with it but one arm was torn off by the second day.

They prefer the tray which is why I bought this model and it works well for about 2-3 months, but the tabs that hold the bottom off ALWAYS breakdown. I'm trying other ""tray"" models. Cheap and great if you don't have ""heavy"" birds or squirrels to deal with. Definitely attracts a lot of birds, just doesn't last long."

671,0,"the feeder holes on this feeder are too big for small seed so i bought chunky stuff with nuts and fruit, nice idea and the song birds loved it. unfortunately so did the squirrels and grackles. the grackles got frustrated because they couldn't get to the food the conventional way so they began to fly at it (I swear) to get it swinging and dump the food on the ground. the benefit for them was that the top came off too -- easier access! the squirrels then promptly figured out how to pop the top as well. i have stopped using it."
109055,2,"I bought this mainly to reinforce my dog's inconsistent response to my requests and to stop his bad habit of eating every thing that's on the floor which often causes him to gag and vomit it back up later. My two main problems with this product was:1. The intensity of the correction at the lowest setting was too intense! I had the dial set at 1 and my dog would yelp and bark out in pain and run around the house in fear. I would never forget how angry he looked and barked when he got that correction, ran down stairs to escape while looking at me with anger. The lowest setting was just too strong for him to even concentrate on being trained.2. The transmitter buttons did not always lead to a correction. Hitting the buttons on the transmitter was hit or miss. Sometimes the message got sent to the receiver and sometimes it seemed as if the buttons got stuck or just wouldn't send out the message to the receiver. Of course, it is crucial with remote collar training for the dog to receive the correction immediately once you press that button.My other gripe was that the transmitter was kind of large, you need a screwdriver to access the battery compartment and no rechargeable batteries. Needless to say, I returned this item and wound up getting the Petsafe Yard and Park Trainer which I have only been using for 2 days now but I am much more satisfied with this product. It costs twice as much than this device but I get rechargeable batteries, a small transmitter that consistently gets the correction to the collar. I keep it on the lowest setting and that correction does not make my dog vocalize to the correction. It just gets his attention. I will see how that one stands up against time but so far, so good."
159902,0,I bought on of these for my Australian cattle dog that pulls when i walk her. This harness is ok for calm dogs but If your needing a harness to make walking easier i would suggest getting one that crosses in front of the chest.

Get creative. Give em to the dogs. Enjoy."
188094,0,"I purchased two of these vests for my dogs so that they would be seen in the snow as something other than a hunted animal. First off, I found them to run a bit small. My male, Herman Munster, has a very large chest, and the strap barely fit around it. The back strap also has a fit issue. If I were to close it, it would come right across his penis. Not a great feature. So I had to snap it together on his back, so it just kind of flaps around like a cape. The first time he wore it, the strap got caught on a branch, and totally unraveled. So even if the placement had worked, it's of no use to me now. My female, Lily Munster, is on the chubby side, and the straps barely fit around her. I couldn't go up a size, because it would be too long for her body. So all in all, I'm not impressed with them. Sizing was an issue, placement of straps, durability also did not impress me. The concept is great, but I could've been more impressed."

151933,0,"If I am going to spend this kind of bread on a dog bed, I expect higher quality and better durability. I purchased this bed for my mini Daschund because she just loves to burrough and be cozy. At first, the cost did not deter me because I love to find things for her to enjoy, and she is certainly worth what I thought would be a very special treat. The bed's cushion compacted very quickly and has done so unevenly. It is like a cheap, lumpy, flattened pillow. Because of that, she has taken to sleeping on top of the bourrough pocket. Again, my doxie is a smaller type of her breed, and so she does not weigh much. She is also pretty gentle with her bedding in general because she considers it her own little territory and she is pretty neat and tidy. I have purchased other nice beds for her for less cost which she enjoys far more and finds a lot more confortable. I am just really disappointed with how lumpy and flat the cushion as become. It is a very attractive bed, and the outter materials are of good quality. I would also recommed, however, for the sticthing to be better reinforced. If the manufacturer could design a similar bed with better filling for the cushion, it would make a HUGE difference. I shared my opinion with a co-worker who excitedly purchased two for her small dogs right after I bought this bed. She also shared the same sentiments with me. We agreed that we would not have purchased this bed for the price being asked had we known."
91248,0,The bed is nice and sturdy. My dog did put a hole in it after a few weeks. Not sure if after such a short use if a replacement cover would be worth it.
93147,1,"My cat loves to sit on my lap when there's a heating pad on it, so I got one of these so she could have her own heating pad. The last time I bought my cat a cat bed she sat in it once and that was it. Not interested. She LOVES this cat cushion and sleeps on it every day. It really does warm up with her, it's like magic! I wish there was a huge cushion for me too like this. My cat is a bit older - 8 years old - and I'm guessing this is extra-good for older kitties. She gives it four paws up!"

I'm not sure if it's because they're not used to it, but they really don't want to eat it, so now it's just collecting dust in my pantry. At least it was affordable, so I didn't waste a ton of money buying it. Maybe someone else's cats would like it? Or a dog, maybe? Better luck to anyone else who buys this for their pets."
190762,2,My 30 lb dog had this in 5 pieces in less than a minute. I didn't even get the tag off and he already had it torn up. Not for chewers!
121938,0,Ordered this for an 8 week old 3 pound puppy. Thought small would be a pretty good size for her but it is actually rather large. She can't get her mouth around it and squeeze treats out. Instead she rolls it around and one or two fall out which seems to entertain her for a bit but does nothing to help with her need to chew. Surprising because I ordered other puppy kong products and in small and they are perfect size. Maybe she will grow into it but for now she just chases it around. Also the material is very stiff and not easy to bend leading me to think even if it fit her mouth shed have a hard time with it anyway. If you are looking for something for pup to chew on and release treats I wouldn't really recommend this. However as a chase it and maybe a treat will come out toy its working pretty well.
137568,2,"I love the design and look of this feeder. After receiving not one but TWO of these sets, (In case the first was an error) I am so very sad. The paw print design on the bowls and mat is not black, but a very distinct ROYAL BLUE. If you can use blue, then you will love it. I cannot, so I will keep looking for an attractive elevated feeder. Of course the metal stand itself is black. The packaging it comes in states the product is black, but it is certainly NOT. The bowls were nice and heavy. I did not bother assembling the rack since the other items were the wrong color so I can't comment on how sturdy the rack is."

She is still pretty small, but she almost makes the ""regular"" size one look too small.Pro: rolls nice and easy clean upCons: TOO small and maybe not worth the nice clean up."
18509,0,"Please do your research. You can get a tank like this at Petsmart (made of GLASS) for no more than $20, probably less. And with a tank so small, you really shouldn't be that concerned with getting a super high quality/expensive tank. Maybe if you are getting a 55 gallon you should be more concerned. Acrylic and glass have their advantages/disadvantages, and Petsmart actually doesn't carry very many acrylic tanks."
142449,2,"We have two young cats and the LitterMaid box worked well for us for approximately 3 or 4 months before extended kitty use took its devestating toll on it.1. Cats scratch up the litter which then ends up in the tracks the cleaning comb moves in. Litter and other debris (you know what I mean :-) can gum up the tracks and prohibit the comb from sweeping all the way across the litter box. Fixing this requires a major, detailed cleaning which is hard to do well and not risk damaging the electronic components of the box. Aside from the ""cleaning the box thoroughly"" issue (see #2 below), prior to cleaning the product it will sometimes get stuck in this loop where it continually tries to keep push comb down the track, get jammed, detect this, and then retry only to fail again. It effectively prohibits the cats from using the litter box until you fix it by unplugging it and waiting a few seconds and plugging it back in. This is disasterous when it happens while you are not home for several hours -- say at work all day.2. Cats often don't pee directly down into the litter. Our male cat hit the sensors, tracks, etc... There were two consequences: (a) you have to be very careful cleaning out the sensors and wiring to make sure the water doesn't damage the electronic components of the box -- this was a huge pain and very easy to screw up and (b) and in the end, even if you are diligent about trying to keep the electronics clean, dry and functioning, I don't think they are designed to handle long term exposure to the pee. In the end, all the sensors and electonics simply stopped functioning for us, making it a very expensive regular litter box which is hard to clean."
182935,1,"This is not the first time I have purchased a LitterMaid Self-Cleaning Litter Box. Previous products resulted in somewhat a mixed review. The last unit seemed a little less powerful and bogged down frequently. This unit performs well. Though it is not a cure-all, some manual effort is needed to scape the bottom of the tray, it certainly makes the job more a part time clean up. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for some assistance on a nasty job or who spends some time away from home."
163714,1,this is a GREAT collar for the price... looks exactly as pictured. Shipping from this vendor was fast (but a little pricey). Really fun collar
188532,0,"Every time I ride I get chased by dogs because I ride a recumbent trike. The Silent button with the ultrasonic sound is less effective than the other button that makes the continual irritating noise. The dogs do pause which gives me an opportunity to cycle away, but on a few occasions they have continued to pursue - especially the smaller dogs. Generally it works though. I wish they would make it smaller so attach more conveniently to the bike and also that it would stop the dogs dead in their tracks once the button is pushed. All in all it has actually been very helpful."
95295,0,"I purchased 2 of these collars (mango orange and snowball white), 1 for each of my 2 cats. One loves it and has only taken it off once. My other cat won't keep it on. It bothers her neck I think. I have had these since April 2012 and the cat who hates it has managed to put all kinds of teeth holes in the clasp and chew marks on the collar itself. She wriggles her bottom jaw through the bottom part and stretches it out so she can take it off. OR if the part nearest to her chin is the clasp, she chews on it until it pops open. I am not sure this is a flaw in the design or functionality of this product but it has since been lost for a month or so."
135910,1,"I have a 13 y.o. Golden Retriever who was having a very difficult time getting up and walking. She had lost all muscle tone in her hind quarters because of this and I was afraid that my time with her was getting short. Her spirit was still pretty good, but she would fall down often and then struggle to get up again. I started her on a combination of Cosequin DS and Liquid Health's K-9 Glucosamine on Thanksgiving weekend and am amazed at the difference it has made three months later! Actually, she started showing signs of improvement within a few weeks of starting her on the supplements. Last weekend she even ran several laps around the back yard. She is still a little slow to get up and limps for the first couple steps, but once she regains her balance, there is no stopping her! She is as playful as she was at two years old again. Highly recommended!"

89871,0,This is a good disenfectant for animal quarters and kills most of the common nasties and a few not so common. Ken'l-Lan 128 doesn't have a strong odor or perfume smell which is a big plus in my book. The only major drawback is the pink color which can stain clothes or table tops when diluting. If you do get the concentrate on clothing it can be permanent if allowed to dry.
120971,2,"This filter came with my 5 gallon tank kit. At first, I thought it would be good because the filter packs are easy. After the first week, a gunky film developed at the bottom of the tank. I tried to siphon it out and change the filter more often, but it kept coming back. I finally bought the Aqua Clear filter and it is much better. The water is crystal clear and there is no built up on the bottom of the tank."
165954,0,"Some background info about my pup: She tugs and pulls everywhere we go. It's like she doesn't even recognize me at the other end of the leash while at home she listens to everything I say. Sometimes she likes to make my life harder when she hops 4-5 ft instead of walking. She is a 45 lb labrador/hunting hound mix. When she sees squirrels, she gets into hunting position with her body low against the ground and walks like a lion about to catch its prey. She goes from an angle where the squirrel cannot see her. When she is 5 ft from the squirrel she will make such a prounce that it feels like my arm has been almost ripped out if I'm not careful. I still love her though.About the Product: This leash has done the job for casual walks. I will NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of retractable leash if I know we will be in an area where I want her to be close, controlled and safe next to me. I just don't trust my pup too far away on a thin leash like this (even if it is all belted) with her hyperactivity and strength. Any moving object will make her go crazy and she can EASILY snap a leash like this especially if she is 16 ft out since I have less control the farther she is. I use it only on night walks when I know there are not many squirrels or distracting things outside. She has her freedom to walk a little bit more on the grass and go to the bathroom. Other than that, for her exercise I will take her to a dog park, baseball field or by the waterfront near me on a sturdy 6 ft leash where I run along with her.I would recommend retractable leashes for small dogs (yorkies, chihuahuas, malteses, etc.) I would not recommend retractable leashes for hyper dogs (of any size really other than toy size) or large dogs especially if it's somewhere risky or not safe. This leash is great for casual walks where you want your dog to have some bit of freedom."

89632,0,"I was a bit leary about a dish that would slow down my dog's 30 second from start to finish dining habit. Thought I would give this Brake Fast dog dish a try. I got the small red size which holds 2 cups of dry foood ( more than enough room for my dog's dinner). The dish is made of a very sturdy heavy plastic and is easy to clean. This dish sells for $18.95 at my local speciality pet store so this is a good buy on Amazon. The bowl does extend my dog's ability to gulp down his food to about 2-3 minutes to clean bowl. The one problem with this bowl is it slips and slides all over the floor while the dog is trying to get to his food. The bowl needs some sort of non skid pad or rubber on the bottom as the dish does not stay on his ""dining mat"" or in place on any type of mat or floor. I am happy with this purchase but will need to ""modify"" the bowl to continue using on kitchen floor."
170543,1,"I bought two. My dogs actually use them, and I've washed them twice with no fading. This is a very good product. My only note is that they do look dirty fairly quickly if your dogs are outside at all. But... it's a dog bed... what more do you want?"

45036,1,I needed a lightweight carrier to transport two large 'Maine Coon' cats who alone are not featherweights. This works beautifully. The mesh might be an issue if cats were destructive when confined or stressed but if not this is a great carrier. Also folds up out of the way when not in use unless your cat(s) might find it a great place for napping or just being in personally chosen time out. Of course to make it more comfy add something cushiony to lie on.
207070,1,"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use on the door of a (cat-sized) hard plastic travel crate. (A smaller crate might require 10 or 12 oz dishes.) By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have four 20 oz versions in our Ferret Nation 142 cage. Love 'em!"

208775,1,"I bought this for my aquarium. Wanted some floating plants for baby fry to be able to hide in, and this looks like it will work perfectly. When you buy the water lettuce you receive 6 floating plants. The size of each plant is just less than 2 inches across and just over 2 inches deep. The leaves tips is the only part that is above water. The rest of the leaves set just below the water surface. So I am not sure how well it would work for insects, keeping them out of the water. I seen other review talking about how many pieces there was, must have been for the duckweed since this comes all ready to put in your tank no assembly. Overall work well for my use and I plan on buying more."

68939,0,"This whistle is okay--it attracts more birds than my dog!! I love how it has a case inside of itself and isreally light. My cat likes it better than the dog due to it letting birds come down to her level.But I cannot guarantee it will work for your cat.I'll keep trying with the dog, we will see if she everobeys to the whistle.Thanks for reading my review."
87740,1,"The first fountain we had was the Petmate Fresh Flow and the water flowed directly down a ""ski"" type path. The Drinkwell flows like water out of a faucet and our cat Ginger seems to prefer that method. It's easy to do the once a week cleaning and does not have to have a filter."
69565,0,"This device has no on/ off switch which is very inconvenient, only way to switch off is to take 9V battery outWill trigger when dogs bark quite accurately, but also triggers falsely when other noises are around, like loud talking, banging, etc, which is why we leave it off until we go outWe have noticed our dogs are better at not barking when we return from being out (the reason we bought it) but the problem isn't eliminated.Ryan"
19738,0,"I bought this item on Dec 29. 2006, and administered it to my three kittens on January 15th, it has been about a month and a half since they had the pill and I've just noticed a reoccurence of tapeworms in the one kitten that started out with the worms initially (he contaminated the other two kittens after 2 months of living together). Initially I was thrilled because immediately after giving the pill I haven't noticed anything until a week ago...I gave it awhile hoping my cat had somehow sit on a grain of rice (wishful thinking i know! lol) but sadly he has those nasty little buggers again. I will say however that my cats never exhibited any of the diarrhea or salivating that was a side effect of the pill. I will give this product one more chance - hopefully nipping it in the bud while the worm is weak (i hope)."

174338,1,"I bought this on the recommendation of my cats' breeder. It removes lots of extra hair quickly and easily, and all four of my cats love it. Once a week I hold a Kitty Spa, which consists of giving each one a good brushing with the Zoom Groom. They line up for it! Even my cat who doesn't enjoy being held and petted will lie down and enjoy being brushed. And I feel great about throwing away a big handful of fur which would otherwise end up on the furniture and rugs or in their digestive tracts."

15120,2,Bought this for my young husky. I don't know if her fur was too long or what but she could bark and whine 90% of the time with out it going off. It worked properly about 4% of the time and the remaining 6% it would go off if she was running or playing. Completly unhappy with this product. I would not recommend this to anybody.

If the cats had been enthusiastic about this food, I would have felt good about feeding it to them, though."

36670,1,"Our two year old golden retriever is the most playful dog I've ever met. I can't always keep him entertained, so it is great to have a toy like this. We use it to feed meals, or keep him occupied when we have guests. It is fairly quiet, and very entertaining- both for him and us!We also have kongs, the molucuball, and the food cube. The kong and molucuball don't present enough challenge, and because the food cube is made of rigid plastic, it is very noisy on our wood floors.I think everyone with a high-energy dog should have a tricky treat ball."

117315,1,"Our dog had a perpetual motion barker, but only at night. All the yelling and cursing had very limited effect. The first night we put the collar on him we heard a half bark and that was it. There have been digressions but always because collar was not charged or put on upside down. It has been two weeks now and we tried one night with the collar off, he rapidly reverted. Hoping our MENSA dog catches on soon."
181097,0,I was looking everywhere for a white cage. I was adopting 2 rabbits and the only place for them was in my bedroom so it had to match my furniture.I saw this cage on Amazon.com and ordered it. It came in time for my bunnies. It is a good cage for them. It is sturdy and dependable.The only negatives I have to mention is that it came in pieces with no instructions. If I could do it anyone can - but I didn't expect it in pieces. Also it came with the box slightly damaged and a reddish clay film covered the pieces so I had to clean them down before assembling. If you are willing to clean it and build it yourself it should be worth it to you.
32098,0,"I have three cats--one who's diabetic and one's who's just thirsty!--and have owned both of these. All my cats liked the drinkwell fountain--it made a noise like running water when the water fell into the bowl, and that attracted them. But the motor gave out, so I tried a petmate: I like the way it looks, that it's easy to clean, and that it has an on/off switch on the cord (the drinkwell has to be unplugged, as I recall, to turn it off), but the cats aren't much interested in it--there's no trickling water sound as the water glides down into the bowl. But I will try another drinkwell, since the cats do prefer it."

However, my 4 yr. old female cat (16 lbs) just did not understand. She used it for maybe the first week, and then decided she no longer liked her new litter box. We have now gone back to a standard litter box with a litter locker. I was really hoping that this would work, but obviously it's not for every cat..."

36718,1,"I've had this tricky treat ball for about 2 weeks now, and not only is it still in great shape, but my shiba inu still gets excited when I bring it out for mealtime. He caught on very quickly; despite being an active chewer, he bats the ball around with his paw or muzzle until the kibble randomly falls out (very clever design, the opening with the inside ridge). When the ball goes into a corner or other obstruction, he patiently picks it up with his teeth and carries it a few feet away to free space and continues to bat it around. It's a good way to get him to focus on eating, and is a natural transition from playing to eating (since he always wants to play). No worries, he hasn't forgotten how to eat out of a bowl; but it's a nice activity to occupy him while I'm also trying to sit down to eat! Highly recommended to purchase from Amazon; I saw it the other day at PetSmart for $16.99..."

108407,2,"I've owned a smaller scatmat for years, and can't say enough good things about it. For keeping our cats away from places they shouldn't be, it's 100% effective. When it came time to protect a larger area (our cats scrabble at our bedroom slider for hours on end - which is fine if you don't require sleep), I shelled out for this larger mat - but beware, the mat you will receive is not the one displayed in the photo or described in the product narrative. This (different) model is branded ""petsafe"" rather than ""scatmat,"" and the controller is ""paw shaped"" rather than rectangular - although the shape of the controller makes no difference itself, this particular variety does NOT have a three-speed intensity control (as promised, and as does the original ""scatmat""). This is important to me because the single setting offered in this model is quite a jolt - maybe not harmful, but more than I want to subject my little cats to, even once. I keep my original scatmat on the lowest setting, which is just fine. This ""new"" mat also seems to work erratically - after it discharges it won't discharge again for some time, usually minutes. The controller is also difficult to figure out and use (and yes, I read the manual), and is very non-intuitive. This is a far cry from the original easy-to-use scatmat with the rectangular controller and three-speed setting, and I'm puzzled why Amazon is not sending the item described in the photo and product description. I sent mine back (easy enough), and was lucky enough to find an original scatmat on another site - more expensive, but worth the price. And tonight I sleep."
51083,0,"A few months ago, I decided to do my own independent testing of major clumping litters in search of one that would work best for my cats.Methodology:2 cats4 litter boxes1 month with daily scooping.Products tested (avg 20lbs per litter box):Tidy Cats Power BlendTidy Cats Instant ActionArm and Hammer Super Scoop, Fresh Clean ScentScoop Away Fresh ScentResults:Scoop Away won hands down at clumping even after a month. Where the others would eventually start to break apart into small pieces, Scoop Away, as the box describes, ""clumps tight"" and rarely did so. However, it loses a point for being dusty out of the box and its obnoxious perfumey smell. I could always tell when one of my cats had been to the little box. The perfume would waft behind them. Though, I suppose that was better than the alternative.Tidy Cats, my staple for years, had the least obtrusive odor and was the least dusty from the start. However it, never clumped as tightly as the others. After about a week and a half, the resulting clumps broke apart easily. The Power Blend (aka Premium Scoop) was a huge disappointment. It didn't perform anywhere near as well as the Instant Action (aka plain old Scoop). Its clumps started to break apart within days. Although not a part of this test, I've noticed in the past that Tidy Cats Small Spaces, another ""Premium Scoop"" also never performed as well the regular scoop.Arm & Hammer clumped well, but was perfumey and very dusty the entire time.Cats' opinion:None. They didn't seem to favor one over the other."

81984,2,"If indeed this is made of plastic, then you're taking a huge, huge risk (more so as the number of gallons increase).If you don't understand/care about the animal-perspective argument, then you should care about the possible damage to your property if this explodes (read as water exiting quickly out of the tank).Obviously this is unhealthy for fish, and it's only made worse by the fact that it's only a few inches wide and - again - it's apparently cheaply made.If you want a 'conversation piece' take the money and buy a good aquarium. They are as much or less than this."
41583,0,"I will say first, I no longer own this cabinet as my LitterMaid gave out after about 2 years (as they are all want to do, apparently, but that is another review entirely).First off, if you buy the unfinished wood version of this, I would paint it as soon as you get it, so you can actually wipe it down. Inevitably, there will be cat pee on this thing, and you won't be able to clean it off the raw wood.Also, you have to be okay with modifying your LitterMaid to use this; you have to cut a small plastic strip off the underside to make it fit. Not a big deal, really, just something to know. (I was made aware of this prior to purchasing it, and I think the manufacturers even tell you that, to be fair.)I found the replacement bags were handy, but expensive, so I ended up buying a plastic container from IKEA that I placed under the ""poop chute"", which I then lined with grocery store bags. Not as convenient, but it worked, and was much more inexpensive.Overall, I found this to be an improvement over the LitterMaid system, but I'm still waiting for someone to come up with a better mechanical system."
26462,0,I recently bought this dog house for my Beagle/Hound. Its very appealing to the eye however after the first rain one of the boards on the roof started to split. (We've had it 1 month). I'm hoping it holds up because we paid a little over $200. and thats a lot of money to throw away.I will say that it was easy to put together and its very light.
82027,0,"Not so much boots as they are slippers.They seem to be made out of a thin plastic nylon and didn't stay bottom-down while my dog walked around so they got worn out pretty quickly; especially outside. Even the ones that fit primarily the way they were supposed to ended up coming apart at the seams around the rubber padding. I ended up wrapping them in electrical tape to repair them which seemed to work okay until I could get new ones that were more durable and fit better.If you do get these, I suggest you keep them for indoor use and get a pair that might just be a little snug on your dog's paw so that the padding stays where it's supposed to be. If you need durability and want to get these anyway, I highly suggest having a way to reinforce them inside and out (there's a smaller pocket inside the larger exterior)once they're delivered if your dog does a lot of walking or you intend to use them for a long time/often."

He doesn't like it when it sprays but he will bark until it's gone and then he knows he can just go to town. I give it a low rating not just because dogs are capable of figuring it out, but it's too sensitive. It goes off when other dogs bark and even if he just shakes his body it goes off. You also can't return it so I'm out $30 on yet another product that doesn't work on our intelligent dog!"

113632,1,"Purchased two of these beds for my SAR K-9s who sleep in our kitchen on the tile floor. We'd used a number of different types over the years but these are the perfect weight, just enough bolster around the edges so my ""boys"" can curl up and feel like they are in their own private niche. Love the dark gray color - doesn'tshow black dog hair and they are super easy to take outside to shake out, air and wash (don't dry in the dryer!) - they air dry very quickly on a drying rack.We pancake them when the dogs are outside to clean the kitchen - no more wafting dog hairs or dog fuzz on the area rugs in the living room or sun room.One possible improvement - adding a slightly more rubberized or stronger adhesion material to the bottoms would help keep them in place but these don't slide around that much and my older dog will drag his to be right next to my feet by the computer then settle in with a very contented sigh :)Added benefit - the beds fit perfectly in my dogs travel kennels for Search and rescue training or deployments - a quick wash and they look like new!!Price/value - excellent ROI!"

98098,1,"I've used Seachem ammonia Alert meters for years and find them indispensable.The meters do NOT replace proper testing of your water parameters and are not meant to.

38415,0,"I bought this box because we needed a new one and my husband was eyeing an expensive electric model. We have three cats that share one box. The electric models seem designed for one cat households and I didn't want to spend hundreds on something they wouldn't use because it came on so often they're scared away! So, we tried this one as a compromise and while it is okay, it's just not worth the cost.First, the description ""large"" is deceptive. I can't imagine what the medium must look like, but the large isn't very big. I'd say it would be fine for one medium sized cat. The divider takes up over a third of the interior making the box even smaller for my cats. One of whom is very big. The box isn't deep enough so we have to add litter often. The rolling feature is okay, if you have a lot of space around the box. However, my cats tend to stay half in, half out of the box when urinating so it piles up at the front and sticks to the box, so rolling doesn't clear it and I still have to reach in to scoop. This is annoying because the entrance is small and the lid wasn't easy to get attached so I don't want to remove it. Honestly, I am just considering taking our the grating divider and scooping like we used to.Overall, if you have one small or medium cat, this box will probably work great and be worth the price. If you have a big fat cat, or multiple cats like me, then avoid this."

My fish tank is overstocked with fish, contains live rock and a clean up crew. I use the fluval c4 HOB filter, as well as a air powered skimmer. Just added a HOB refugium that i made out of an old penguin 350.Again, purigen is amazing!!! And i highly recomend it. You can easily buy 1 pack and have it last a long time with refreshes in bleach. Buy two, and that way you always have one in the tank, while you refresh the other.I would guess i go about 2-3 months between refreshes. They say the beads will turn black, mine turn more of a reddish brown. perhaps i could let it turn more black, but i noticed by the reddish brown time frame, my water parameters start to get out of wack."

164711,2,"We purchased this automatic feeder a little more than a year ago to provide precise portion control for our two cats and help them lose weight, and also so they would stop bothering me for food all day (I work from home). It took a long time to get the knack of this device; I had to write down the steps on a post-it and refer to that for about a week before I got the hang of setting it up every day. Needless to say, if we went away for more than a day, we didn't even bother to try to explain it to our pet sitter, and instead have her come 2x per day, which defeats part of the purpose of having the device. Finally, after about a year, we noticed that one of our cats had gotten quite svelte, but the other had not. After some observation we realized that the larger cat had figured out how to defeat the device and was eating portions that were supposed to be for later in the day. I'm still not sure how he did it, but I've finally given up and am looking for an alternative feeder."

Okay, so he's not the smartest dog on the block, but we love him!Also, we still step over it, although you can move it aside easily. We're just so used to stepping over the last fixed gate that we are in the habit. This one is quite tall, though, so you have to have long legs!My recommendation is that it is perfect for small dogs, but hit or miss for success with the dogs over 30-40lbs."
136665,0,"Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, BeigeI bought this and started using it about 2 weeks ago. I am disappointed at how much litter gets knocked out of the box because my cat won't use the step. She doesn't like the step because the step moves the whole unit because of the sensor.My cat prefers to do different ""business"" in different boxes, so unless I want to buck up and have $600 invested in my cat's bathroom habits this is not providing me with a self cleaning situation.This ended up working out ok while it worked. My cat started using the step and I bought the thing so that less litter would kick out, but even with the litter guard there still was a lot of litter after usage. The unit has stopped working now and I don't know what is wrong with it."
119401,0,"Our dog LOVES this ball. We really don't have any complaints with the construction of the ball...but be careful if you have a dog like ours. We have an American Bulldog who loves toys, but also loves to destroy them. There is a plug at the top of the ball to fill it with water, sand, etc. and it's recessed so that the dogs can't pull the plug. But our dog likes to hook his bottom teeth into the recessed part and then use his top teeth to try and bite it. It has left a ring of teeth marks all the way around the top of the ball. Two concerns: 1) it's hard on his teeth and 2) the teeth marks leave little bits of sharp plastic that then rub on his nose/face when he's rolling it around.He usually only does this when he gets tired of rolling it and chasing it so we try to stop him before it happens (he only plays with it while supervised)"
178631,1,"My cocker spaniel has the migrator pheasant, and it is her absolute favorite toy! It is a good size so that she can easily get her mouth around it. The sound is a very realistic one, not the typical ""squeak"" found in some other toys. However, I believe that all the migrators have this same sound, which is somewhat like a duck. Also, the pheasant produces the sound fairly easily, which just delights her to no end. Well worth the money - I will be buying some of the other migrators too!"
16289,0,I was amazed at first with this product. My dog hated the stuff I sprayed with it. Although it fades quickly apparently because soon after she went right back to chewing it. I guess you have to keep spraying it over and over again.

179094,0,"Our very bright but suspicious two-year-old female cat was unwilling to complete the training with this item. I really believe she had more of an aversion to the flushable wheat cat litter than the toilet training itself. She kept waiting longer and longer before she would use the litter pan (not a good sign). It was, however, the appearance of the first hole in the middle of the contraption that made her completely reject the idea and start using our sofas as litter boxes. The instructions say to replace the missing piece and start over, but that didn't work - she was through.When calculating how much you're going to save on cat litter if this works, take into consideration how much you'll be out if your cat decides against it and ruins your furniture. That being said, I am glad it works for some cats. It's a cool idea. It just depends on the personality of the cat whether it will work or not."
10108,0,"My daughter purchased this over the weekend from a local pet supplies store and she was instantly thrilled with it however after a single night of use, we've all become dissatisfied with it.Our issue is with the wheel on top. As other posters have stated, the Hamster loves the wheel however she loves to bring everything up into the wheel: Food, bedding, feces, etc. This was fine during the day when she slept, but at night she would use the wheel and all you would hear is the food clunking around over and over again. It also sprayed food and feces all over the purple track portion. We finally had to remove the ""fun"" slide and the wheel altogether and capped off the hole. I will be purchasing a separate wheel to place inside the cage and then some additional tubing so she has somewhere else to go.Aside from the wheel issue, the cage feels a little small for a regular sized Hamster. It is hilarous when she squeezes her body up the tubing, but she has had no issues getting everywhere in the cage. With the slide removed it seems larger, but after replacing the wheel it will surely feel cluttered again.Overall, I give the cage a 3 out of 5 stars, primarily due to the wheel issues. Otherwise this is an OK starter cage."
205378,1,"My dogs stood up on their feet for 2 minutes straight while I was taking the backing off both the SMALL and LARGE sizes of these squirrels that I got them. They loved them at first sight. They continued to love them. However, there is some of the tail hair coming off and I find wet blobs of tail hair near the dogs and toys. So I am a bit concerned about that and the thought that they could swallow some of that material and it could be bad for the dogs. So I watch them more carefully as they play with the toy. I am considering washing them in the washing machine a few times just to get all the lose hair off and hope for the best that I do not totally ruin it. Very inexpensive online."

207537,2,"We originally bought this aquarium for a betta. He seemed to do okay in it, although we lost him after about 9 months and we're still not sure why. But we decided to replace him with six neon tetras and in about a week we lost two of them when they got sucked into the filtration system. It was awful and a torturous death for those fish.We just switched to a Marineland integrated aquarium system Eclipse Hex 5 (5 gallon tank) and so far it seems like it will be much better for the tetras. Its also quieter and easier to keep to clean. The biorb was my first tank, so I had no idea that it was more difficult than other tanks to maintain."

121471,1,"Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it. I put a Kong liver snap treat (KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large) in the Kong (KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red) first, then ""anchor"" it with the liver paste. I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog. Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted. This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING. Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz........."
114686,0,"I originally liked this collar a lot because it did not chafe my Boxer's neck and it's attractive. But after two months the ring that one attaches the leash to bent and broke off. Now, I will say that my Boxer does pull a bit, but, she's only nine months old now and was seven months old when I got the collar, so she's not that strong; it's more like frolicking than pulling like a race horse. And, the return policy is that I have to pay for shipping and get only a partial credit so it's really not worth returning. For the price I do feel like Planet Dog should have a better return policy. But, I can use the collar for my dog when she's not on a leash, so that's good. So, it's a nice collar but didn't hold up to a large dogs antics."
100010,1,I GOT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE PUG PERSIAN CATS THAT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH WEEPY EYES AND IRRITATIONS. THIS IS EASY TO USE. I HAVE TO PUT IT ON MY FINGER AND SMEAR IT INTO THEIR MOUTH BECAUSE THEY WON`T EAT IT OFF MY FINGER.BUT I DON`T HAVE TO USE MUCH AND WITH MY CATS THAT`S NOT A HASSLE
126862,2,"The fact that this is one of the most popular hummingbird feeders on the market is mostly due to its wide availability, cheap price, and gaudy styling rather than its quality. I used these feeders for years before discovering better designs, and I came to hate them. The first thing I noticed was that they're hard to clean, with too many small parts and hard-to-reach tubes and crevices. It takes way too long to take the feeder apart, get all the parts clean, and reassemble it.The next thing that became apparent is that the ""bee guards"" really don't do a very good job. Honeybees and wasps can't reach the solution through intact guards, but some long-tongued bumblebees can, and tiny bees just crawl right through the guards (and often right into the bottle!). They're also bright yellow, the same color as many bee-pollinated flowers (what was the manufacturer thinking?). The insects really swarm around when the solution oozes out, as it's prone to do on warm days (particularly if you refill the bottle with refrigerated solution).It didn't take long to discover that this feeder is also not very durable. The plastic parts don't hold up to exposure to sunlight, becoming brittle and loose over time (more quickly in sunny or high-elevation areas, where intense UV light seems to deteriorate the plastic more quickly). The hardened glass bottle is actually the most durable part of this feeder, while the bee guards are the first parts to break down. The size is okay, though if you've only got one or two hummingbirds visiting you won't want to fill the feeder completely.The best hummingbird feeders cost about twice as much as this model, but they will last at least 10 times as long. The feeders I use most now are the Hummzingers from Aspects and the Droll Yankees LF, both saucer-style feeders. For high-traffic times such as late summer, I switch to the Nature's Best bottle feeder. I never use anything in my feeders except the solution recommended by all hummingbird experts: sugar water made from 3 to 5 parts water to 1 part white table sugar (do not add food coloring!). This is much more economical and probably also healthier (and tastier) for the birds than overpriced chemical-laced commercial mixes such as Perky Pet's ""Instant Nectar."" The solution should be changed every 2 to 4 days and the feeder cleaned thoroughly at least once a week, no matter what kind of hummingbird feeder you use."
153325,0,This door lasted for about 18 months when my chihuahua charged through it one time too many and the door broke. The product has a three year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement door.
163655,2,"I'm sure this is great for some people but i just didn't expect it to be like it is. First of all, its sand, not really clay. Even with water, the consistency is that of wet sand. This means its not as easy to mold with your hands if you want to make something for your animal. All i ended up making was a stupid rock because it was so hard to mold. I still have a big portion of the bag left though. I would never let my leopard gecko burrow in this stuff. Its way too messy and i feel like she would get buried. You definitely need patience and something to mould with in order to get this product to work right."
134373,0,"I have had three of these filters. I like the filters when they work, and they do work well. Unfortunately, they have an annoying problem of the motors burning out. The first one I owned took a couple of years to burn out, and the second one took only two months! Of course there is a warranty, but I cannot have my fish without a filter while Marineland processes my return and the replacement, so I ended up buying a third filter, which means that when I get the replacement, I will have an extra new filter on hand. Oh well, I guess that will be nice for when this third one finally burns out. While checking reviews elsewhere on this unit, I find that I am not alone in this experience. These units are apparently very sensitive to power fluctuations and temporary power outages, so I have put a battery backup/surge protector on the new unit. Hope that helps this one last longer. Speaking of warranties, when calling to get the RA, I was stuck on hold forever and never did get an answer. Will try again tomorrow.Bottom line: Filter works well when it does work, but longevity/durability is a problem, and customer service is an epic fail."

Merrick Food they eat with relish."
193865,2,"After using Nutricoat for over 2 months it has not worked as well as other products. My dog is starting to itch again and his coat is flaky. I tried this product because it was cheaper than Arctic Paws Salmon oil Supplement that i use to buy. I will not buy this product again. When using arctic paws you can smell the fishy salmon and it almost leaves a greasy lining on the bowl. This product is light in color and has no smell. It does not help with his coat or entice him to eat his food as much. But each dog is different, my boarder collie give it a paws down."

After about a month I had to replace it, and now that won't work any longer either, even though it is less then a month old.

I still don't know what went wrong; it simply stopped working and no battery change helped."
85592,2,"There are lots of old ""theories"" circulating about just what in the urine causes the killing off of your prized grass. The most common of these misguided opinions is that the urine is acidic and 'burns' the grass. As a result, a host of home remedies have arisen to change the pH of the urine. These measures rarely work because the real culprit in urine burns is nitrogen.This product does not work and can be harmful to your pet. Your pet may develop kidney, bladder or liver problems."
132578,0,I got this product because my dog likes to dig around the fence line and get out. My neighbor had told me about this item so I gave it a try. I does work on my small dog. But...It has no effect what so ever on our lab. Have tried using this to make him stop jumping up on people and it does not work. I have noticed that our cats can also hear it. So obviously the smaller the animal the more powerful it is to them. I would definitely recommend if you are trying to train a small dog.
39769,2,"Don't do it. This kitty box is a great idea but extremely poorly executed. It spills litter all over the place when you rotate it (the clips don't hold the top on tight enough) and if you overfill it you end up with a scoop full of perfectly good litter that you have to dispose of. In addition, the box is small so cats generally will track more litter onto the floor than they would with smaller boxes. Even if you use a kitty rug, as suggested by some other readers, your bathroom will soon look like a disaster zone.Not worth the money or effort."
16580,2,"After recieving the product it would not turn on. I open the reciever collar to check the batteries. They were installed, but I found the design to hold and close the batteries to be very poor. At this point I decided it was not worth it and decided to return the collar."
106637,0,"These pads are OK. They are thin however, I haven't noticed that they leak at all. They should be changed as soon as they've been urinated on so that they don't leak through. I used them under my grandmother who wears a diaper and cannot get out of bed and I also put them down for my dogs, a 60lb Golden Retriever and a 30 lb Lab, in case they have to go and can't make it outside. Again, no leaks from any of them."
14873,1,"I had used Frontline flea control effectively for many years until we noticed last summer that our dog was scratching all the time. Someone suggested that we might have purchased a bad batch of frontline and so we bought another package but still he was scratching. We were applying the Frontline faithfully on schedule but still scratching. Our level of frustration grew until we thought he might be suffering from allergies or mites. After trying many other (expensive) treatments, he was still scratching so bad that we had resorted to putting dog clothing on him to protect his skin. Finally in desperation, I was scouring the internet for solutions and read an article about flea control becoming ineffective. Many people were commenting that Frontline was no longer working for their pets but that Advantix was. I purchased the Advantix and 6 weeks later, my dog was completely scratch free. I know it sounds dramatic but this restored sanity to our whole household and needless to say our poor pet is now out of pain and torment. Plus we no longer need to question whether he has allergies or mites. It was fleas all along - but they were not obviously visible."
195510,1,"My cat loves these little, light-weight, plastic, spring-shaped toys. He rolls them, flips them through the air, and carries them in his mouth. So many toys are too heavy for cats to play alone with, but these seem perfect. I usually give my cat two at a time. I find them all over the apartment, showing that he plays with them even over night."
78650,2,"Mine is in the garbage. It is impossible to fit and to get on the dog. Once on the walk, the leash gets tangled as he turns, because it is attached in the front against his chest. It would only work well if I walked in front of him. I will stick with a traditional harness with the leash attached on the top of his back. I feel much more in control and my big dog is much more comfortable."
151348,2,BUY FROM A MANUFACTURER THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT NOT THIS COMPANY. We bought a small unit through Amazon mid march 2011. The warranty is good for one year. Literally 1 year AND 2 WEEKS LATER (so 2 weeks out of warranty) the unit dumped all the food during the night into the bowl. The motor tries to turn but the food won't dispense anymore. We called the manufacturer 1-888-ERGOSYS and spoke with SAMUEL email sam@ergosys.net who had us look at the timer (not the problem) and test the motor from which he determined that a power fluctuation caused the motor to strip the gears. WRONG! It's on a power protector because our pet's health is important to us! Even after speaking with his 'supervisor' the best they could offer is to sell us a replacement base for 20% off the $70+shipping+handling charge which is nearly the cost of a new unit. They don't sell the parts or do the refurbishment. ANY COMPANY THAT WOULD NOT HONOR A UNIT 2 WEEKS OUT OF WARRANTY IS SIMPLY NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. For $120 you can buy a lot of other feeders so do yourself a favor and buy a different brand.

68635,0,"I bought this at my local PetCo and with the protective plastic tab in place (to keep the battery fresh & new).When I got it home it only worked for about 15 minutes. My dog was totally intrigued by the toy while it worked.If it lasted longer I'd give it 10 stars, not 5. It's a really cool and fun toy...for both dog and his human pet. :-)I'm planning to return this toy (which I purchased YESTERDAY!) and exchange it for another one. Hopefully the battery will last longer.Perhaps the company should include an extra set of batteries in the purchase price. After reading other reviews it seems that battery life is an issue for this product.---------REVISED REVIEW ON APRIL 16, 2009Okay, I exchanged the malfunctioning item for one with a nice fresh battery and LOVE it! I'm not sure who likes this more - my dog or I! It's a really fun toy, and my dog is totally fascinated by it. He tosses it around, barks at it, chases it, etc. The toy's voice and sounds are obnoxious and very funny. I highly recommend this toy, especially for the price...as long as the batteries work! :-)"
109072,2,"Doesn't seem that many of these sorts of devices work for very long. The Petsafe Little Dog Remote trainer is no different. The transmitter works via a 9V battery while the collar unit works on a couple of button batteries. The unit works ok but the battery life goes down the drain in only a few days. If you forget to turn the collar off, you'll be faced with dead batteries in a short time.This is unacceptable because the collar unit, while not even being used to administer the slight electrical shock, runs down the battery quite quickly by just being on.The unit failed to function in less than a year. Not recommended."
103103,1,"The Beast is hands-down the best dog cable tie-out I've used. My husband has bought numerous cheaper, thinner cables with standard clasps. They don't last very long at our house. The one-hand operation of The Beast's clasp works really well for me, and I have arthritis. Also, our German Shepherd Dog has had no trouble getting out of tie-outs with standard clasps. She simply rolls in the grass until the thumb latch is activated. Then she's free! But she can't get out of The Beast! Thinner cables crimp when they get tangled, then the plastic cracks, exposing the metal cable to the elements. This results in thinner cables rusting quickly. The Beast's thicker cable does not crimp, plus the plastic sleeve is softer, so it doesn't crack. In our Wisconsin yard, with our 75-lb GSD, thin cheap cables last one season. The Beast lasts several years. Definitely worth the extra money."
162997,0,"I got this with my Fluval 306 after reading the complaints about the strong and narrow water flow.well this spray bar seems to do what's supposed to do: spray out the water outflow evenly.I installed this vertically on one end of the tank. I really like the 90 degree arm that allows to bend/keep in place the filter's hose. other than that, there is nothing impressive about this.I wish there were more accessories that could allow further customization of the bars. like 90 degree connector where I could install the bars in ""L"" shape. or a connector that I could have both bars side by side shooting water to different directions.I will go to local hardware store to see if there is a matching connector that would allow me to do this. after paying $20+ for a few pieces of plastic, I wish there were more possibilities in the box.Edit 04/03/12I found good use for the second tube. I'm using one of the tubes as an intake. I have pulled out the intake tip that comes with my Fluval 306 and connected the hose to this tube with holes. so not only the bottom tip sucks in water, but all debris floating around all level get sucked in as soon as they near any of the holes.Now I'm not sure if I should make the holes bigger to allow more suction power."

13967,2,"Your better off with some Penn tennis balls. These smell like mint but I haven't noticed any minty smell on my pup. That may be because I'm not smelling my dogs breath on a regular basis.They aren't chew toys, and they are not marketed as them. I tried playing fetch with him and he refused to give it back, I ran all over the place and crawled under the table trying to get it back. Eventually he lost it somehow and my mom found it in her closet.The problem with these is that my pup enjoyed eating the fuzz off of them and peeling the fuzz off the ball (which came off with a layer of the ball) I woke up one morning to a half tennis ball, half lacrosse ball.If your dog is well behaved and not a heavy chewer go for it!"

I replaced the already new batteries with another set of new batteries, and still had the same issue after 1 week. Reprogramming does not seem to match the instructions. This item is fine for short term use, but not long term.... and please do not buy this if your pet has a medical condition requiring precise amounts/timing of food."

The leather is just too impregnated with oil. If you squeeze the leash it oozes oil on the surface. Wiping with solvents does no good. The only way to get rid of the excess oil would be to run the leash through a pair of rollers spaced about 1/16 inch apart to literally squeeze it out. I don't recommend this leash unless you aren't bothered by a little oil getting on your hands and everything else it touches."
159226,1,"I have to admit that my dog is not thrilled with this collar, but I am! It has made an amazing difference in how he behaves while walking. It allows the dog walker to have control over the dog's actions in a gentle way."
107720,0,I looked at the local Pet supply stores and online for some time to find the best buy for this particular item.The best deal around was here! I have had several Flexi leashes and needed a really heavy duty one for the Terrier. He has chewed thru leads and broken choke chains!! This one should hold him well.
91184,1,"This thing is awesome. So cheap, doesn't break down over time, totally washable, and my dog loves it. She prefers it over the couch, actually!The fabric is very rough and plasticy so I layer a couple of blankets on there to protect her elbows."
101563,2,"Like others I struggled to fill the dome the first time without making an awful mess, a partially occluded 2 cm opening to fill a 2 L (32 fl.oz) dome is ridiculous! Figured out later that filling the open base without the dome in place would achieve the same effect and is a whole lot easier.Took some serious fiddling and repositioning to get everything in place so that the water flowed correctly. Forgive me but ""align the largest bubble with the green elevated portion of the base"" has got to be the dumbest instruction I've read in a long time. The blue plastic ""bubbles"" are almost impossible to see through the dome. Also the most important thing that needs to be positioned ""just right"" is the fountain pump, mine got dislodged in shipping and the instructions do not even mention the correct position of the pump. I finally found where to place it so that it worked effectively, there are little ridges on the base, but it would have been helpful to have a PLACE PUMP HERE positioning diagram on the base. Filling the unit COMPLETELY, so the pump stays submerged, and positioning the pump correctly are vital in order to achieve a good stream and quiet operation. As said, this is NOT simple to achieve.My sense is that this unit would be nigh on impossible to clean effectively.The filter is worthless and seriously overpriced, replace every THREE WEEKS?! You have GOT to be kidding me. Save yourself the money and fill any pet fountain with your own filtered water!OK, so if I figured out the things that other reviewers were struggling with, why am I returning this?Well, for one the AC adaptor gets VERY hot, a safety hazard IMHO.Finally the thing that really got me was how fast the water evaporated. My cats wouldn't go near the thing (if they'd liked it I may have persevered) but even so the water level dropped about 2 cups a day. I live in Arizona which has low humidity normally, I admit, but this is monsoon season. I hate to think how often I'd be refilling this thing in AZ's normal humidity. Makes me worry about the posters who feel they can leave their cats for days with this as the only water supply.Save your money, pass on this one."
37316,2,"Amazon!! Please allow users zero or negative ratings on products!!___________________________________________________________________________Never!! Please, never ever use this product!We have two beautiful healthy young dogs (4-5 yrs), with a pristine health record (until hartz of course). They get premium food - Timberwolf Organics, Acana, Origen, Blue (I mention this because poor diet is often associated with illness in your pawsy companions).We had new neighbors with dogs move in a few weeks ago and my little one had started itching a bit. I was going to order frontline from petmeds and instead picked this up in a split second decision while walking out from Wallys. My logic being, ""hey if it doesn't work, I can still order the Frontline"". Plus it was priced at only $5.99On Saturday evening, I showered the girls and applied this on my itchy one. The next day my dog started showing signs of minor epileptic shocks - yelping in her sleep...yes I do know about dog dreaming, but these dreams, if they were that, were, with shock, pain and disorientation. Since it was Sunday, our regular vet was unavailable. We had no idea how serious this was about to become! That night, convinced that she was having a series of bad dreams we made sure she slept close to us on the bed. The episodes continued that whole night, a couple of hours apart.Next morning I noticed some swelling on her snout and one of her eyes. There was also a red spot on her belly. By that time we had read other peoples reviews on this product and were shocked that this poison is still put out for unsuspecting consumers!! Alarmed we called the local emergency care and described her symptoms. They urge us to rush her there. By the time we reached the hospital, my baby had gone into an anaphylactic shock. She had petechiae all over her abdomen and she was swollen all over!She was hospitalized after she was stabilized with steroids, antihistamine and antibioticts. Our woes did not end there though. I can go into more details, but I feel it suffices to tell you all that after about four thousand dollars and a homeopathic detox program, we were finally able to get her close to normal. After about a month and a half today, she still takes some herbs and supplements to support and balance her messed up immune system.Just ONE tube of the three doses!!The amount of anguish and death related to this product far outweighs the justification of dogs who might be 'flea free'. In the course of that week we must have met atleast half a dozen vets who just shook their heads when I mentioned the Hartz product!! It has killed hundreds of cats apparently and is more fatal to their littler bodies (my dogs are about 65lbs each).Please do not, do not buy this poison!!"

The price range should be $10 to $15.Even with all my dog's toys inside, it would easily slide all around the floor, spooking my dog when she tried to get her favorite Loofa out of it. I added 4 adhesive rubber feet to the hard plastic bottom, making it much better. It could use some weights for stability.Minus a star for stability and minus a star for value.The size is good and it keeps all the toys neat. It's a conversation item for visitors."
34619,0,this is a nice size mate for my two baby cats and their litter box. i think it is big enough for them to come out of the litter and clean themselves on it. but the problem is it doesn't really help to trap everything. i still have to clean the floor everyday and yank the mat to get rid of the semi-trapped litter off otherwise it will be worse the day after. it is very annoying.i was hoping to get something better than this for the money I paid.

145050,2,Bought this product because our dog was chewing up our resin/ratan outdoor patio furniture. We went through 2 bottles and it didn't stop him at all! We had better luck with hot pepper & chili powder than with this product. Bummer........we were really hoping it would solve the problem.
204874,0,"I have two 13 week old pups both have been sleeping in these crates fine for a couple weeks. Today my girl was biting the gate and managed to get her lower jaw caught in one of the larger holes on the bottom. The hole is just large enough for her jaw to fit through and she was stuck quite firmly. I heard her screaming and ran in. It took me about a minute to get her free and luckily there was no lost teeth or injury. If I had not been home I think she'd have probably pulled her front bottom teeth out trying to free herself. If your dog looks like it could fit its jaw through these holes I'd suggest taping something to prevent it from doing so.Otherwise I'm happy with the build quality and overall design. My pups have had a couple of accidents in their crates and its very handy to be able to split the crate in half to hose it.If you intend to use this in the car, the gate does rattle quite a lot. I'm sure there would be a pretty simple way to dampen it if you are taking it on a long trip."
51609,2,"I purchased Stink free for a strong cat carpet odor that I could not remove. I used the whole bottle, and it never removed the odor.Stink Free offers a money-back guarantee if the product fails to remove the urine odor.

134816,2,I was excited to recive as I also own the sling ted to recive as I also own the sling by outward hound. Unfortunatlng by outward hound and love it. Unfortunatly was a bit dissatisfied with this front carrier. The front part is well constructed and sturdy but then the actual straps that go over your shoulder are flimsy and thin. I wish they would have padded them like normal backpacks but the straps make me worried about the lack of support from the straps. The pic of the model looks nice but when I wore it looked about ten months prego and struggled to walk upright. Might just be me but if the straps worked more like a backpack it would have been great. Just feel they cut cost on the worse part.
12238,0,These pads are a hit or a miss... seems like there are two qualities that arrive when you order. one is more sturdy that the other. and since i use these for my dog that is trained to go on a pad i prefer to get the same quality pad at all times

213325,0,"The only annoying thing about this is that the food doesn't refill into the bowl easily. I don't think its the food I use, cuz its just your basic cat-kibble shape. Since my cat can't seem to figure out how to use her paw to trick it into spilling out more food, I have to go over to it every so often and shuffle the food stuck in the back forward so that it will refill. Not a big deal, but definitely a design flaw."

I've ordered a second one since I thought the problem was caused by coincidence, but the second one gave the same problems after 3 times use. All in all too expensive for the quality offered !"
186349,0,"I give this litter box 3 stars because it's made well and looks great. My cat would pee in it, but not poop in it. He would cry....then go on my comforter.He never figured out how to stand on it. Always went backwards or sideways.The manufacturer has a great website with many videos of cats doing their business on it. I think it just depends on the cat.I just think that trying to force a cat to do his business within a 8"" x 5"" oval is just too stressful for them. Plus, if your cat likes to diligently cover up his business when he's done, he won't like this. Mine would step down and try to reach into the hole to cover up his pee, but couldnt really get the job done. He was confused and tried and tried.By the way, this entire box is the size of your own toilet lid! It's quite compact and snazzy looking. I really think it would be absolutely PERFECT to train a kitten on this. The kitten would be small, and wouldnt mind the small area to use. But trying to get my 1 year old to ""downsize"" just wouldnt work.The actual area to put litter was about 12"" x 10"". So you will use very little litter. I'm thinking it's a must to use clumping litter with this box, though, because the ""pan"" part is so small, theres no room for scraping and foraging without getting litter everywhere. Scoopable litter would be easy to scoop out the clumps though.Give it a try if you have a kitten. Didn't work for my young adult cat."

100214,0,I should have read the dimensions. It's a nice toy and well built but this toy is a bit too big for my two puppy cavoodles. I think it will end up being given to their Labrador friend. I'd recommend it be bought for larger dogs.
159419,0,"i would say, go digital.These are fairly accurate thermometers however if dropped in water or rattled around too much they can get stuck in the same spot for ever.This can be bad because you may think your reptile or whatever your keeping has the correct temps and it may not.Digital thermometers with a probe on the end i would say would be your best bet.The digitals are only about $8 so i'd say thats much more worth while than one of these.Also once applied to glass they make a sticky mess on terrarium walls if you ever need them to be removed.One last note, the hygrometer (humidity guage) of the same make i would not recommend at all.I've had a couple and they fall into the water and get stuck at 70%,60%,etc forever.If you cannot tell if your herp or reptile has enough humidity i simply suggest you mist their enclosure as needed."

115107,0,"Being a pet mom to both a dog and a cat, I have many different size/shape/thicknesses of pet beds in use in my home. I think to call this a ""bed"" sets up expectations the product does not meet.The cover is plush on one side (feels like a synthetic faux fur), and non skid on the other with tiny rubber like dots that cause the fabric grip onto whatever surface it's placed over. The fabrics used on either side are good budget fabrics but not what I'd honestly call ""luxurious"".The plush appearance in the photo is largely due to the thickness of the faux fur fabric. The filling, about 3/4 of an inch thick, is medium ""dense"" as opposed to ""soft ""- sort of the idea behind a thin, firm pillow. Stated another way, the filling provides a little loft but does not feel squishy. This can be a plus as some of the softer feeling fillings like Dacron tend to flatten very quickly and bottom out over time. I'll report back on this as we own it longer.I have not washed this yet so I cannot comment on that feature at this time.Bottomline: A decent value as a crate mat compared to pet supply store pricing/offerings, but I have purchased other mats here on Amazon of similar or better build quality for less. I would have been inclined to offer four stars if this mat was priced at least 25% cheaper."

162510,1,"We have a small house and just got our third adult cat. Since I am always concerned about litter box odor I thought the Litter Locker looked like a useful product for isolating waste without running constantly to the trash can in the garage. Similar in concept to a Diaper Genie, the Litter Locker turns out to be precisely what we need. It fits neatly by the side of the litter box, making frequent scooping (you need to use clumping litter) a breeze.Even with three cats, we only need to empty the Litter Locker once every 3-4 days. I was concerned about how long the refills would last, but we are still on the first one and it's a month now since we started using it. We've had to take some stuff straight to the garage but 90% of the box contents has gone through the Litter Locker and we are just now getting to the end of the first refill cartridge.The convenience of not having to go the garage in my PJs and slippers to dispose of the box waste every morning is wonderful! Since it's so easy to keep the box clean we can use just one box, so the savings on litter and plastic liners and disposal bags more than pays for Litter Locker refills.The only reason I don't give the Litter Locker 5 stars (I would give it 4.75 if I could) is that the sides are a bit flimsy and it can be a little awkward to get a very full load out of it. However, it's completely sanitary, and even if I let it get too full it's not messy or disgusting to change. All the parts can easily be taken apart and washed if necessary - a very important feature. The bag is strong enough to hold the waste with leaking yet flexible enough to tie off easily for disposal.The directions are great! There are two pages with pictures, which may look a bit overwhelming when unpacking it, but it's really easy to set up, use, and refill. The directions cover absolutely everything, but do it once and you don't need them again. It's a simple assembly that goes together very logically.So ... one cat or a dozen, apartment or huge house, the Litter Locker is a great way to keep the place clean, sanitary and odor-free."

19112,0,"I don't know if this is a good pump or not. I ordered it based on previous reviews. Some of the reasons I purchased: pump is designed for smaller ponds, the pump has a handle for easy removal from the pond, and the cost. The pump was shipped well and the pump itself was made sturdy. However, you need to be careful removing the lid. I can see if someone was in a hurry they could easily snap the side brackets. I returned it because, on this particular model, you cannot add a diverter control valve. Pondmaster doesn't make one and you cannot outfit it yourself using supplies found at Home Depot. So keep in mind what you see is what you get!Also, returning has some draw backs. You will need to call for RNA. Bic Supply will not give this number over the phone they will email it to you. Not sure why, as most other companies give it out over the phone. I found this annoying. If this product had a diverter control valve I would have kept it."
44721,0,"The idea of a recirculating fountain is great, but in practice it didn't work out so well. One of my cats was able to push the fountain so water spilled leaving just barely enough for the pump to work. Also, he's able to gets his mouth on the carbon filter and started pulling at it. If your cat doesn't attack the water fountain, you might be OK."
140586,0,This was a lot smaller than I expected but I guess that was mostly my fault for not paying attention to the title that well. Besides being a completely different color than the picture and smaller than I wanted it seems like a good buy.

Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it. Sure enough, I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of Frontline, like clockwork. (and all other causes have been eliminated--they have a healthy diet, etc etc)This product may work well on some dogs, but for mine, the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs. Many people have reported that their dog stopped having immediately after stopping using Frontline.I'm switching to a gentler, natural brand."

What was the most disappointing, rather upsetting, was the way the crate had been shipped! The shipper plainly stuck shipping label on the original box (as if you are picking it up at a local pet store) with NO PROPER CUSHIONING or SHIPPING PACKAGING - the package came in its box half open, exposing the product. As a result, any one can imagine how the crate appeared as it was assembled -- apparent scratches and whopping here and there! What was even worse was I emailed Amazon thereafter to express my frustration which led to an as-if-helpful response saying I might feel free to return it. Shipping the gigantic item back would probably cost more than the crate itself, I had no choice but to keep it.All in all, irresponsible shipping packaging and disappointing Amazon customer service."

Read a few more reviews and equally split the amount I gave him between his two meals. I then saw a difference. Last summer I took him entirely off them & other items as he was itching a lot and we thought it may be something in them that he was allergic to. However, after a couple of weeks off the green-ums the lawn burnt spots were so large they were very unsightly. I once again gave him the green-ums, the itching did not come back, and my lawn once again had much smaller and less severely burnt spots. I would highly recommend this product.

We have 3 cats and it was just a standard model so even though upset with the short life I decided that we did over work the thing and moved on.Decided to try one again and the LM900 Mega was larger and rated for multiple cats. I bought this a few weeks ago but it took a while to actually get it out and set it up, the setup was easy just didn't want to mess with the old litter box (a packing tote). We keep our litter box in the bath tub of the spare bathroom so initially I used battery power they gave out in about 6 days. I strung an extension cord to the bathroom and plugged in the LM Mega and it worked fine for a couple days I got home last night and it wouldn't stop raking. I spent much of the night reading post how to correct the issue tried the recommended fixes and they didn't help. I got closer to the litter and the box then I had to when I scooped.When it was working it was very nice to just have to empty the holding tray but now it's making me crazy. I should have taken the advise of many posters and not purchased this product but I was hopeful that getting the mega would make a difference."
64222,0,"Before giving this to my dogs and cat, I took this to my vet, to make sure there wasn't anything harmful in there (a move I highly suggest after getting some questionable supplements from time to time). What the vet said about the ingredients:- In general, nothing there was harmful, BUT she didn't see anything that would help periodontal health.- The ingredients (according to her) are: an herb given to nursing mother dogs and cats, taurine (always good for health, but has nothing to do with tooth health), some yeasts, and cranberries. She believes that maybe the anise oil, combined with the yeast, combats bad breath. However, she couldn't see any way that it actually cleaned teeth, as it claims.As for my experience with it, the dogs and cat like to eat their food with this on top, which is always good. I don't really notice a particular dearth of stink from the animals' mouths, so I'm not sure if this does what it says it does. It's been about two weeks, so I'll post another update in a few months. But as it stands, I say this is about as good as any other food sprinkle, with (so far) dubious health claims."

27028,1,"Just finally got set up with new one. Bought a used tank with a fairly new filter and then could not get it to work. I called and got coaching ---finally ordered a new impeller which they sent for free. Then I went to buying a new engine, which also did not work......finally, with their help and encouragement I sent all the parts back to Marineland, even though I was technically out of warranty, and they sent NEW system quickly to me. I set up right out of the box and knew what to do because of my history of tinkering with the non working model and Jazam ! worked like a charm. One headache is the carbon filter cartridge which DOES come apart easily with some care and attention, but at first it seems a very poor design and instruction manual is NOT very clear on how to open and keep it all 'together' at the same time. Based on customer service treatment I received, they have a loyal customer now....and so far - water looks great ! Can't wait to really see in about one month how things work out."
138243,1,"One thing to note is that if you are cycling your tank with fish and Stability you must also useSeachem Prime 500mlto detoxify the ammonia and nitrites that are naturally created through the cycling process.I used Stability every day for about 2 weeks and it worked just fine for me. I also use it after every water change or when adding new fish to the tank.A good filter will also make all the difference in the world. I have a small 3 gallon tank which is hard to filter properly with in tank filters because there's just not much room. So after researching filters I decided I wanted to get a canister filter. So I got theFluval 206 External Filterand usedMatrix, 500 mL / 17 oz.in the middle basket, and 2 bags ofSeachem Purigen 100mlin the top basket. I used two because one bag didn't cover the whole bottom of the basket. I would suggest gettingSeachem The Bag Filter Media BagandSeachem Purigen 500mlfor a canister filter instead, but the two bags is easier to deal with at first. Either way will work just fine.So using these products when I restarted my 3 gallon tank and 11 small fish I had 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites, and 0 nitrates until my tank cycled and then I still had 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites, and my nitrates vary from near 0 to 5 ppm. I had no fish deaths and no stress on the fish through the cycle.So having a good filter and Seachem products really makes having a small tank simple instead of very hard. Now I still did a 20% water change every week during the cycle and continue to do the water change every week.I did quit using Stability after 2 weeks because I continued to have 0/0/0 readings and so I discontinued using it except for when I did a water change. Then one day my nitrates were up to 5ppm so I knew the cycle must have been completed. So far I've not seen nitrate levels above 5ppm.You mileage may vary, but the numbers don't lie. This is what I experienced.The tank I have is similar to this one:KollerCraft AQUARIUS AquaView 360 Aquarium Kit with LED Light - 3-GallonI think it's the same, but my top is white. Yeah, I thought it would make a nice Christmas present for my daughter while walking through Walmart early last December. She just loves going to see the fish...What a nightmare this tank is as it comes out of the box for someone who doesn't have a clue about what he was doing at the time. So I modified it to use the Fluval 206 filter and built a custom LED light system and bolted it to the top. So my fish and plants are doing great now. And I can have a good school of fish and not 3 fish as suggested for 3 gal of water. So it now makes a beautiful small tank."
101179,0,"We are renters with a dog and there are times when accidents happen. We use Woolite Deep to fight the stain (excellent) then use this to deodorize the area. This advice was given to us by a worker for Stanley Steam Cleaner and it has been a great one-two-punch on getting the carpet clean and scent free. Bonus, the products don't damage the carpet or leave an irritating residue like Resolve (every steam cleaner we have met laments on their hatred of Resolve because it makes it difficult for them to get the dirt out of the carpet)."

122830,0,"I wanted to get this food because the price is more reasonable as compared to my cat's normal food, Science Diet Indoor Formula. I bought a small bag to try it out, and I'm glad I did, because I'm not buying it again for the fact that it makes my cat's poo ridiculously smelly! Even though I clean the litterbox near daily, wipe it down with cleaning wipes, use sanitizing spray on it, and have an air purifier clsoe to it, I can STILL smell when he has gone to the bathroom. The cleaning combination was effective when he was on Science Diet.If it doesn't make your cat's poop smell something fierce, then this is a great deal. The product has good, all natural ingredients, and is inexpensive compared to the other brands."
13954,2,"Looking at this item I just could not figure out 2 things 1- how does it keep from tightening if the dog does pull? and 2- why does the leash part come off to one side rather than the underside so that you could walk the dog on either side- in the pic you can see the woman has the dog on her left- what happens if the dog crosses over to the other side? With a gentle leader this is a little bit of a problem but then I just flip the leash to the otherside- with this I could not envision doing that because the leash still comes out to the side.Well within a few minutes of using it I had my answer- there is no way to prevent either of these issues from happening and for me that is a problem! How can you give a correction if it gets tighter and stays tight? What I really don't like is that when it does stay tight it is sometimes not noticeable because they can still open their mouth and it looks loose but then you feel the part behind their ears and that is where the tightness stays!I walk my 105lb Moose on a gentle leader every day and he has no issues with it (though b/c of my own in attention to 'corrections' he will now pull on that- my bad though- it has been an excellent solution). But the first time I putt his on him he refused to move- it is just like his gentle leader but can be fit looser to start with. I convinced him to move we went on a walk with me loosening it every 2 minutes I would guess (no exaggeration). Then we get to the front yard and he once again refuses to move- maybe mad about a shorter than usual walk but the thing that made this a serious problem is that I could not pull him to get him to move because it just keeps tightening! Scary tight! With the gentle leader the nose loop tightens until their mouth is closed but it can not get tighter- this can keep tightening- there is nothing to stop it! I won't blame the leash for why he was being so stubborn but it is definitely the reason he won that battle! (Seriously my dog is not that out of control either! He is just big and strong!).So if the gentle leader works so well why did I get this? Because I foster other dogs and as a rule they are all horrible on a leash because they have never been on one. I did not want to get another gentle leader because I would have to re-adjust it for each dog and this seemed like a better general tool for that. It is really easy to put on and the one foster I have tried this on accepted it immediately with nothing more than praise (not sure if that is just her personality though.) which is a great thing! It is light weight and very strong and has reflective material along the whole thing and that is a bonus. Premier brand stuff is generally well made and this is no exception! However, it is poorly designed in my opinion. There needs to be a stop that prevents it from tightening beyond a certain point (it would add one step to the adjustment process but worth it) and something that allows it to slip back to a loose state after a tug. I would love to see them improve on this.Read the other reviews to decide if this is right for your situaton- maybe it will work for you- A dog that walks at a nice 'heel' would do great in this but then why have it? If you have a dog who is likely to still pull then I don't recommend this. If you do get it just be sure to check the tightness of the part behind the ears during your walk, don't rely on looking at the nose loop to determine it is loose enough."
190610,1,"My pup pulled me all around the neighborhood before. We tried a regular collar, a harness, and a 'choke' collar (I hate those things, but I was desparate). She just pulled harder and harder and harder. I got the Gentle Leader, and even though I haven't perfected the fit yet, I saw a huge difference in just the first few minutes. Totally different concept from a regular collar, and she doesn't pull against it (except when she gets REALLY excited, but she doesn't pull hard at all, unlike before). I'm finally able to walk my pup without frustration."

76225,0,"I've had this heater in service for over a year in a tank with about 25 gallons of water (approximate size 2' x 4', 5-6"" deep). It houses a fairly large RES and a couple of smaller but active turtles.First, this heater does not keep the water anywhere near 78 degrees. However, the turtles sometimes like to hang out near it, and you can feel that the water is a bit warmer in that vicinity. They also have a log and a basking lamp for serious warming up, but I think they use the gradient that the heater provides, even though small. It does cycle on and off and does warm the water overall a bit but not lots. On the other hand my house temperature is in the low 60s during the winter, which is asking a lot.Second, the cage seems very sturdy. Turtles can be destructive, but they haven't damaged this at all. The heater itself is still working fine for what it does.On balance I find this a useful addition to their tank, but if you want something that really warms this quantity of water, you should look further. I suspect something higher wattage may be needed. Given that turtle tanks tend to have a high surface area to volume ratio, I think heat loss should be more significant than for the average fish tank. Comments from any engineers out there?"

129708,0,"Yes, you do get what you pay for, and at this price point I was not expecting too much. I used this for a couple months to regulate 3 UTH's on 3 10 gallon tanks that were in my QT area. . . they did OK for regulating the heating pads, I used lights on a dimmer / timer to stimulate not drop temps, and this set up worked very good for the price . . . now I've moved to a rack system, and moved this from my QT 10 gallon tanks to just a simple rack with 9 tubs on 3 lines with 3"" Flexwatt. Ok it worked pretty decent for the first month on this set up, but as of today temperatures can no longer hold stable. It seems like the split channel is not opperating evenly, so I plugged a power strip into one channel and all 3 lines into it. Again, the temperature variance was tremendous, and the drops and high points were insane... I've gone to a back up Hydrofarm t-stat for the time being, but I am pretty dissappointed that this t-stat failed after such a short period of time. My hydrofarms have worked ok(ignoring the thermometer on board since it is bonkers off), but I have herpstats on the way for the rack, and even for my display tanks to consolidate all my heating elements. If you can afford better, save yourself time and a little money by buying better initially. If this is for a 10-20 gallon tank with 1 single undertank heater, you'll probably be fine for the long haul, but do not expect this to work with multiple tanks / pads / tape. it just does not seem to put up to the ""abuse"" of this low wattage system. But if you need cheap, I might also advise you go check out the hydrofarm t-stat over this. You'll be happy with the digital readout, and electronic controls, plus the grounded plug is a benefit for those who have grounded surge strips. Cheers."

It is also easy to fold up and store. My sister and my neighbor have both used it to house their puppies in and because of the zipper the mom can get out and the puppies can't. It gave mom and pups plenty of room.
22600,1,"The Furminator pretty much functions as advertised. It's more useful for long-haired than short-haired cats, and probably would have worked wonderfully on my old Scottish Fold, Pugsley, who had a thick wooly undercoat that matted terribly. The comb somehow pulls out the ultra-long underfur on my domestic long hair and works really well on fluffy tails. The only thing I don't care for is the weight, which makes it easy to apply too much pressure to the cat while combing."

I did find a missing bee, in one of her favorite places. ;-) I think the fluttering wings and bright colors really are something she cannot resist. However, over time, I have noticed she has been having lots of fun with her hive... she has two Hide A Bees now! She actually stores food she does not want to eat in the hive when she doesn't feel like burying! And she just loves to charge down the hall giving the thrash of death to the beehive! Under $10? This is a doggy must. I can see her figuring out ways to use the toy time passes. Not looking forward to fishing out the food stored in the hive, but oh how we love them! And we thought it was rather clever she was in a rush, and saw the beehive hole and dropped her food in. Oh and a LARGE is a perfect size for a 13 pound dog.

178855,0,"The product is fine, but the issue falls with the punching out of the rings. The instructions state to punch each out as your cat seems ready to move on to the next level, BUT if you went too fast and need to go back to the previous level, naturally you cannot replace the punchout! Also the package insert advises you may want to punch out a half-ring if your cat is slower to catch on. There are no perforations to do a half-ring. Anyway, since cats cannot talk, if you misjudge their rate of progress and punch out the plastic ring, you cannot go back. This product can serve as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive kitty toilet training rings of various sizes. Obviously with those, you are paying for more sturdiness and the ability to back up to the previous size/level ring if needed.So, how did my cat do? She is age 9, and was only partially successful. It may work best with a kitten. My cat would urinate on CitiKitty fine, but would not defecate. She held it in all week and finally went just outside the bathroom door on the carpet. I cleaned and wanted to start again, but by day 3 I knew she would just go on the carpet again. :-( I have done a lot of internet research, and this is a common problem. (The competing product even has a forum with a post dedicated solely to this problem.) I am single and at work all day, so couldn't monitor her toilet trips like I read that other pet owners have. Nor did I feel comfortable locking her in the bathroom as some did. Plus I felt so awful knowing she must be so uncomfortable not wanting to use CitiKitty enough to hold it in all week!Bottom line, it's not just the product. It's your cat, and your dedication.

93574,2,"I like this design, utilizing the newer T5 lights. The mounting design makes it easy to fit and attach the hood to a variety of tank sizes (max size is 48 inches). However, the materials used tend to be cheap, and the assembly & packing are sub-par. There are no installation instructions included - you will need to remove 1 end-cap to remove the splash guard and install the bulbs.When I first received the unit, there were no mounting brackets in the box, and the splash shield was broken (the plastic is way to flimsy and brittle). I returned this unit in exchange for another of the same. The 2nd unit had a broken splash guard, and 1 of the 2 ballasts was faulty. Again, because I liked the design, I returned this unit in exchange for another of the same. The 3rd unit arrived in working condition, but had no mounting brackets. I foiled this mess-up, because I did not return the mounting brackets I received with the 2nd unit.I believe these problems, the broken splash shields, the broken ballast, and the missing mounts, are all due to the cheap materials used and the pathetic packaging this product is shipped in. The product comes shipped in a box that could not protect the product on a store shelf, forget about shipping. The box is not shipping grade corrugated cardboard, there is no protective packing materials in the box, and the box closing design is so minimal that every box I received was taped and re-taped multiple times before it reached my house.If there was a store nearby that carried this product, I would have bought it there after I returned the first unit, regardless of price, to save myself the time and trouble with the shipping of this online purchase.Now that I have the unit installed, in 1 piece, all working properly, I really like it. The 2 stars are the cheap plastic splash shield, and the incredibly bad packaging.Kudo's to Amazon for their very accommodating return policy."

I thought the water bottle would be a great way that we can continue to take long walks. At first she didn't seem to excited to try and drink from it, but a couple of splashes her way and she was drinking away. I love the idea of this water bottle, BUT I disilke the carrying strap. It is simply a long shoe lace you have to tie yourself. The knot I used has stayed fine, but the shoe lace is TOO thin.

The wig has a nice elastic strap to keep it in place. It wasn't very snug on my dog but it kept the wig on long enough for me to take some pictures. The dress is like a bib that just hangs down the front of the dog and is held in place by a strap that goes around the neck, like a collar. So you only get the effect when you veiw the dog from the front. She tripped on it a little bit at first but what girl doesn't stumble on the hem of her first dress at least a few times? The pictures of my dog in this costume crack me up every time I see them."
111067,0,"My only complaint about this product is, it comes in a brown paper bag that rips open very easily.

The females sharpen their claws and take out emotional frustrations, the kittens just play and play and play. This house now has 3 so that one is always available for nail scratching and playing for whoever has a need, without an argument with another cat."

15609,2,"I had another upgraded bark collar by the same company which was more expensive. When I lost it, I replaced it with this one. I don't like it because you cannot control the degree of the shock. The other one I could put it on high when I was in situations where I knew my dog would bark and my dog would stop immediately. This one takes a longer time and the dog can be almost in a barking frenzy before it begins to go off and then it really shocks him.The more expensive one is much better."

The caps on some of the pins to hold them together keep coming off. They really make the yard look nice compared to other pens we have made ourselves or bought.

For one thing, it smelled worse. It didn't smell like seafood. Since no ingredients are listed on the box I don't even know if it even contains any seafood.The above link has an earlier review I wrote about the importance of the dental hygiene kit and brushing cats' teeth.

100723,0,"My lab mix LOVE, LOVE, LOVES these balls. They are known as ""lawn balls"" in our house and are reserved for outdoor play/retrieving (since they can be rinsed of saliva & outdoor grime). Tugging is definitely out of the question, don't do it. I limit chewing to brief periods outdoors. These have a fair lifetime with this type of play.However each ring is joined at the ends they don't hold up too well considering their intended audience. We continue to play with them until they loosen up enough to completely ""self-destruct"", then my guy is allowed to have the ""daisies"" (individual rings) in the house. He loves to carry them around, chew on them & roll over on his back, pawing them in his mouth like a cat.The rubber is a great consistency for a nice back teeth chew & fun to get stuck around the nose. However, my dog is not typically a ""hard"" chewer; if you have a hard chewer, I'd steer away from these.I was buying these 3-5 at a time from World Market to keep a ""stash"" in back-up since these are a house favorite, but alas we are out & World Market has discontinued them. So we're looking around, but I personally can't justify paying more than $5 for these given their relatively short life-span."

Right after I received the first package, the price jumped to 11.82. The one time delivery price is 12.44. That's an increase of 2.85! Wal-Mart's price is 10.98.

106301,0,"I wasn't sure what to expect on this door, as far as how it fit. Even the actual package had this picture of a dog sitting in the opening of an igloo doghouse -- with no door in sight. It's like the Mystery Product.I have uploaded a bad cell phone camera picture here on amazon (sorry about quality - and light, we're having a storm) so you can see it actually on an igloo doghouse.* The door is slightly triangular in shape, smaller at top. This confused me at first because the opening does not seem that shape. (It isn't, actually.)* The Igloo has some built-in screwholes a few inches inside at the top-sides of the opening area. You're supposed to screw it in before you put the top of the igloo on. We already had it put together but managed anyway.* The door is a soft rubber/plastic, about the thickness of a silicon baking mat for example, but a little firmer. It's not stiff.* The door is about 90% opaque. It's not white but it's definitely not 'clear' either. I had the impression that you could see through it when I bought it. Being able to see 'through' it well is very important to cats. But you really can't much. Bummer.* The flap (it's a 'rubber flap' not a 'door') doesn't come down to the bottom edge of the doghouse. Also it sits ""inside"" the house a bit.So when they make remarks regarding protection from rain, understand that the only rain this will protect the animal from is sideways driving rain, and at that, it still would be puddling up below on the front side of the flap after hitting it -- which is INSIDE the doghouse. Maybe you want to slightly elevate the other side of the house so rain will stay pooled near the door and not the rest of the house (esp if you have a heater in there).In all honesty, I realize this is a custom/specialty product for a specialty item, but given the nature of it, I think it is overpriced and ought to cost about half what it does, especially since prime shipping isn't available."
183476,0,I got this for my rats and they loved it but within about two to three days they had chewed it to shreds and could no longer sleep in their lovable toy. If your pet doesn't chew everything in it's path then i definately recommend this because it's a nice large tunnel that easily fits into your cage and saves much much space.

I stuck the entire gang valve into a bucket of water with an air pump attached to it and bubbles would be coming out of the closed valve at the knob. It was leaking air. Needless to say, I returned it. Don't waste your time with this.Update: I bought a different gang valve which is great.

164550,0,"I wanted a brush for my large dog's teeth. I love the small-dog CET brush, but couldn't find a large-dog brush anywhere except for these dual-head brushes. What a stupid design! You can't lay it down in a drawer without squashing the bristles on one side or the other. I put my brushes in the dishwasher and then the bottom brush gets squashed in the silverware rack. To solve the problem, I cut off the small-dog end of it with a wire cutter. Now I have a decent large-dog brush. The angle is good for a human hand to reach the curves of a dog's mouth. Everything else about the brush is great except for the dual-head business.If anyone from CET reads this, I sure wish you'd wise up and make a single-head large-dog brush just like you do for the small dogs. You're dual-end brush is probably getting your marketing dept excited, but in the real world, it's a joke. I can't understand why you make it easy for small dog owners to get a nice single-head brush, but you penalize large-dog owners.I actually have BOTH large and small dogs. I buy the small-dog single brush for the small guys. I definitely do NOT want the hassle of using and cleaning the dual-head brush."

I live in a small place so the litter box shares a small spare bedroom. I just happened to move the box into the bedroom at the exact same time I switched to Tidy Cats Litter [this brand and the more expensive one]. Within 8-10 days of this switch, EVERYthing in the near vicinity of the box is COATED in dust. The windows, the chair, the dresser... Sickening!!1. The appearance of the Tidy Cats pellets are slightly bigger than other clay pellets... not as 'sandy' in GENERAL. While I definitely like that - it's also somewhat of an illusion as there is plenty of sand within that case, once you start pouring it out.2. Odor control is pretty good. I give it fine on that one. But I'm also a diligent pooper-scooper & box keeper so.... But it's fine.3. Tracking. Ridiculous! Twice a day I'm there with my little sweeper & pan... around the box and down the hallway. Yes.. down the entire hallway!4. The Dust. Like I said, really bad. I had a clean room to start and I am BLOWN away that everything is now coated!! Why does this have to be so hard?? These kitties are so darn cute - why do I have to sacrifice my house to love them??? I'm not saying I won't ;) Because of course, I will.... But you can bet I will keep searching for a better answer.

The filter bag does get dirty quickly and I'm sure it gets pricey to keep on replacing it. Overall for me, I should have just bought a Brita filter and attach it to the sink for the cats to drink."

141794,0,"I was looking for something I could use as a heater for a moderately sized chicken coop (to serve as a brooder for young chicks and later to keep the chickens warm when winter rolls about. Currently we're using a red heat lamp, but the light isn't desirable past a couple of weeks. I was looking at a ceramic bulb, but found this for less money. The downside was that there was absolutely 0 information on the net to tell me if this would work for what I wanted it for or not.Well, I'm going to go ahead and be the first. This would not be an appropriate heater for a chicken coop.It works by super-heating the coil. It seems to be covered in a material much like cast iron and hangs on to its heat for some time after heating. This heater only puts off one temperature: superhot. It will burn in milliseconds and liquid that touches the element sizzles like water drops on a hot skillet. There is no light to indicate if the device is heating or not. The thermostat is very non-specific. You see an arrow telling you which way to turn it to make it hotter, but no indication of how hot that is.There are two reasons why this heater might not be for you: first, the element gets very, very hot, and it being exposed poses a fire-risk for any material that can burn. In fact, the instructions come with dire warnings about not letting it come in contact with any wood or plastic or risk the burn. Therefore this will also not be good in any application where something living would potentially touch the exposed elements. In my case, if I was to put it in the coop, I would wind up with pre-singed chickens.The other reason deals with that thermostat. Its lack of specificity and my inability to understand at which temperatures it would turn on and off mean that I would have to do a lot of fiddling with it to get it to the right temperature.It was my hope that the thermostat would work more like a dimmer, allowing the element to radiate heat at a certain temperature. That would give control over how much heat was produced and allow it to be used in many more instances. Unfortunately this was not the case and I have therefore returned the item to go with the slightly more pet-safe ceramic bulb combined with a separate thermostat."

The reason for the multiple purchases was not because the earlier ones were destroyed (although eventually he does get through the latex and all the stuffing comes out) but just for variety.

It doesn't scoop well and my rake does get stuck on the return path. I checked and there is no litter beneath or on the tracks that would cause it to stick. I nudge it with my finger to lift the rake portion and it seats fine. Who wants to have to manually push the rake each time? Okay, so it doesn't happen EVERY time, but enough to be annoying. It is also louder than the others I have.Go with one of the 900, 700, 600 or 500 series depending on size you need. They last years and are built better!

The nostrils consist of thread that's looped around about 8 times to form the appearance of the nostrils. This toy was only played with indoors. Two of the eggs already had splits on the seams straight out of the packaging.I don't know if my pups is just too rough for plush toys or if this was truly a bad design. For comparison, I got the small mallard (AKC Mallard Dog Toy, Small) and that's still going strong, despite being carried around the yard, squeaked in rapid succession, dragged through and ground into the mud, tumbling down the stairs and run through the washing machine.

(I didn't realize not buying submersible would mean needing to reach a water line indicator.)*This heater's range is 67 - 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Even though the range is low, when I had the heater on the first few hours, it got the 5 gallon tank water over 90 degrees. I've kept it in the 80's range as much as possible.*It requires the tank to be full to cover the water line indicator (I'm breeding snails so I can't have the tank full if I want my snails to lay their eggs on the tank's glass, and if I want to keep them from escaping). The water line indicator also rises above my power filter, so I'll never be able to get the water to the height it's asking.*The power cord is much shorter than I thought it would be. I had to get an extension cord to plug it in. The picture on the back of the packaging suggests to make a drip loop, but the cord is barely long enough to do that, and the top of the aquarium is only a couple feet, give or take, from the socket. Very inconvenient.*It's only good for aquariums up to 5.5 gallons. I haven't tried my second heater in the 10 gallon yet, mostly because the cord is so short, and the tank is much farther from the socket.*Temperature control knob seems really sensitive, and even turning the knob a quarter of an inch seems to cause the temperature to shoot up. But as soon as the desired temperature is attained, it will maintain.Overall it's a decent product especially considering the price. I was surprised and thankful it worked so far outside of its range."
199278,1,"I have a pet care business and wanted a brush that I can use on multiple animals to help their owners with shedding. I heard about this product from another dog walker and a client. It is amazing! I use it on cats and a few long hair breeds of dogs (Shiba Inu, Flat-coated Retriever/Border Collie mix, and Corgi/Aussie mix, Chow mix). It works great for all these animals and the fur comes out much quicker than a regular brush or wire brush. You can clearly see a difference in the coat afterwards. Several people who saw me using the brush purchased it after because they were so amazed. Would definitely recommend to anyone with a cat or a dog with a thick undercoat."
154623,0,"I have a 7 pound cat and this litter box is all his own. I've had it now for 3 months. First I used it without the hood. The cat became enfatuated with the scooper and the workings and kept the machine running every 20 minutes. After 15 days, the poop odor became unbearable though I didn't smell any urine. To stop the cat from playing with the scooper, I added the hood. It worked. The motor sound attracts the cat but the hood made it difficult for him to yank it when it stops moving. To better control the odor, I have added some additional powder which I put in first before adding the litter. This has helped. Still, after 15 days, the poop reservoir is full and sometimes starting to overflow, so I have to change it.Overall, it's better than scooping every day manually. But this comes at a price, the refills are not cheap (on sale, you can buy a regular litter box and litter for less than 1 refill) and, for me, I have to replace the refill twice a month. Overall, it would be about $360/year for me to keep this going--if it doesn't break down."
96401,0,Nice spring loaded attachment for these cutting guides.Take care to avoid catching the tips of the teeth on the skin of your animal. These teeth tips are far sharper than the set that came with my Andis clipper.

These crisps seemed perfect so I tried them out only to have to clean my freshly cleaned tank in approximately two days of using them because of the STRONG RED Dye they use to make these flakes a desirable looking color. If tetra would leave the dye out of these crisps they would be fantastic! Until then it back to a small mix of flake food and Koi pellets."

200264,1,"The Furminator worked great on my short hair dog. Very easy to take the hair off the tool. The teeth on the tool does not irritate my dogs skin, she loves it when I sit and comb her coat. Would recommend to a friend. Great bargain for the price."
181826,2,"I really should have listened to the other reviews, but I thought, ""Hey, my dog's aren't like those dogs."" Really though, my dogs are pretty easy when it comes to me working with them. But even I went cross eyed a few times trying to get the harness on the dogs. Once I got the harness on the larger dog, my wife and I just started cracking up. I mean, we might as well have duct taped the dogs paws together. However, it did work as advertised, No Jumping! But, not much walking either. If I wanted my dog to just stand there afraid to move, I would have been better off putting her in a crate...lol. Shortly after, we were pretty quick to look up how to return the item. Sorry, it's just really not a great product."
58636,1,I was very pleased with the timely manner of witch I received me product ordered. The product itself was exactly what I ordered and I am very pleased with it.
26052,0,I checked the reviews before I purchased. They warned me that it was too hard and the heat didn't last the night. I bought it anyway and sure enough they were right. At least I knew what I was getting into so I can't really complain. I wish there was something better. I use it outside so an electrical plug isn't an option (I'm afraid of electrocution or fire). This is the best option I could find at this time.

82037,0,"These were right for the price, to test out whether or not my Mini Aussie liked having anything on his feet (he doesn't). I bought them to use in the snow, but one shake of the paw and they were flung into the yard not to be seen again until the snow melted a month later! Overall, if your dog doesn't mind having these on his/her feet, then they're a good bargain, but they're definitely the quality of a bargain and for anything more than occasional or seasonal use, spend the money on a good pair of high quality dog boots."
118972,2,"After the dog chews on an end, it makes indentations that turn into small sharp edges that start cutting the gums. If you see the color red, it's not inside the product. It's your dog bleeding. I tried a couple of brands so it's not the manufacturer it's the nylon. Where's PETA when you need them?"
102337,0,This scratch post is okay. We have two kittens and they have used it a little but they don't seem to like the top of it because there is no padding. I would recommend purchasing a post with padding so the cats can climb on top or if you're going for this one you probably want to add some padding to make it more inviting.
61401,2,"Very disappointing - past units were very good (I have had 3), but this one was nothing but problems and broke after 6 months. I would avoid this model, very disappointing - a waste of money."
59903,1,"Best prices on a superb topical flea/tick treatment. Both my dogs are flea-less, and also tick-less. Works really well, but definitely not water-proof. If you wash your dog(s) often, perhaps, find another treatment that works after continual washings. Otherwise, Frontline Plus is a great product in controlling fleas and ticks throughout the year, especially in the hotter months of the year."
114557,0,"I have two dogs, one medium-small, another medium-large. I used to buy the Old West Tendon Strip Chews and have been looking for something to replace them since they seem to have been discontinued. These Old West Pizzles are a disappointment in that they lasted no longer than three minutes with either of my dogs and the medium-small one is not a heavy chewer. I suppose I expected these to be more of a ""chew"", but instead they were quite lightweight and brittle, almost like hard taffy sticks, and were gone in no time. These are still good treats for my dogs - they sure aren't complaining - but the search continues for an affordable treat that'll last longer than ten minutes."
172957,1,This coat is very nice. Very warm. The sizing is the only thing that bothered me. I have bought this size for Trixie before; but this is a little big.
176318,0,I ordered this collar and made sure that it was not listed as a &#34;containment collar&#34;. You will not receive the collar pictured you will receive a containment collar. They sent me a collar with holes in it and no ring (so his leash will not attach). The holes are to attach an electric fence zapper. I do not have an electric fence so I had to return it.**I gave it three stars because I have a lupine collar for my dog and love it. He chewed it once and they replaced it no questions asked. I

164963,1,"When they say Extreme, they mean it. This is way stronger than the regular version. I put a few little doggie cookies in there, or some dried chicken jerky, and my doggies are happy and busy for quite some time. These are easy to wash, and just last and last. Awesome."
34031,0,"The product works fine until it breaks. That said, mine tripped the GFI (ground fault interrupter safety outlet that MUST be used to prevent electrocution) after the first season. I dried it out and tried another GFI on a different circuit and the same thing happened. One of the Amazon reviews tells of another user's interaction with the manufacturer in an attempt to receive warranty satisfaction. Having read that review I decided to buy a different product to replace this one. If the product fails in the dead of winter the pond will freeze over then it's very difficult to insert a replacement heater."
198557,0,This is the second one of these we purchased because we really liked the first one. We use them in our cat condo/towers for our Burmese short hair cats to use in the winter. We liked the fact that the plug in the wall had a switch that turned the heater heater on or off if you weren't using it. When we got another one for our other cat they changed the unit and there is no turn-off switch. You have to unplug it from the wall. A real inconvenience since it's plugged in behind other furniture. Try to find another brand that has the on/off switch on the on cord.
50837,0,"Old model worked wonderfully which prompted me to purchase the new model. New model not nearly as efficient and have to ""tweak"" it frequently. Don't know what they changed in the past 7 years but something is different."
26303,0,"I love Lupine products and I have the matching leash, so I thought I would give this a go when my RC pet martingale wore out. I have to say I prefer the RC product because of the chain versus the cloth on the slip (martingale part). The Lupine collar slip will get ""stuck"" in the tight position and not release very well. It also is fraying where the cloth meets the metal. I expected this to happen, but thought it would take longer than it did. Will get an RC collar again soon, even though it doesn't match my leash!"
109172,0,"I thought this would stop more rain from getting on my dog than it did. His feet still get wet of course, but the hood doesn't stay on his head and it's difficult to get the back elastic straps to keep this straight on his back end. Overall, it keeps the bulk of his body dry, but be prepared to still wipe his belly, head, and feet."
207023,0,"I haven't used the product yet. I will be using it this weekend. However, I was taken aback when I only received one. So, I had to order another one. I wound up spending over 22 bucks. Please read the advertisment closely to make sure you are getting what you want."
11967,1,Got this thing used and it works like a champ. Fully submersible and simple to use. I really like the way you can change the water flow direction at the top. The only downside if any is it's slight bulky size.
58697,2,"Sadly I have tried every medicine suggested including this one for our shitzu. I have been giving her 2 tablets a day, I am almost done with the box and she still eats her poop. I am resorting to taking her to potty every time and keeping her away from it. I have lost all hope. This product must work for some and not others."
184236,1,"This product, though pricey, has given me such piece of mind for my dogs. It was simple to install and use and now my dogs roam the yard and I never worry about them getting out or following another dog in street."
192453,0,"Got this for my 9-yr-old Australian shepherd. I also bought the orange one for the younger dog. Both dogs were able to remove the treats from the balls in under 10 minutes. (It took me at least 5 minutes to put the treat in.) I'm glad I tried it, but won't get any more. Neither of my dogs is a very aggressive chewer...just very clever."
151343,0,"I, too, bought this to deal with an overweight cat, and weekends away from home. Unfortunately, the cat quickly figured out how to help himself to extra food by tapping the auger with his paw. No, he doesn't get much with each tap, but I can hear him messing with it all night long, so I know he is getting more food then his diet allows. So it sits empty and idle in the corner of the kitchen.......To it's credit, the device is sturdy and the timer's many programs makes it versatile."
64986,1,"I love this product! My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)"
198681,0,"I have fed hummers for 54 years. We have been driven mad with the bees, sometimes emptying a 16ozbottle in a day. I am concerned about these new feeders for the fledglings and adolescents. I am seeing that they can't enter the feeder because of the depth their beaks in the basin. I had to revert to my Perky bottles for the little guys still hanging around. I can't express very much about the new feeders because I got them towards the end of the season. Next season the new feeders will be out first training the adults to feed at them and I will go back to Perky. I raised exotic parrots for 17 years."
11713,2,We had this product before and it worked amazingly for several years. This new one I ordered does not work at all however. The timer simply does not even open to the next portion! Luckily Amazon is sending a new one. I hope this new one will work as designed!
42583,0,"This product came in perfect condition, and in a timely manner which i loved! However it is very confusing trying to strap it onto the console...I basically gave up trying to strap it in and it seems to be squished between the two seats well enough that it doesnt move too much. Otherwise it does what it says it does and my dog seems to like it (after she finally figures out that she is connected to it and stops trying to jump around the car with it strapped to her collar...)"
190892,0,"Bought this for my lab/pitt puppy, it fit alright, she didn't fill it out, she was about 20lbs. Also the hat didn't really stay on so that was disappointing. Everyone thought she looked very cute so it was a huge hit. Happy with my purchase but only gave it a 3 because the hat didn't stay up."
88786,0,"When I first received the Drinkwell fountain and took it out of its package, I knew I was in trouble. The unit separated into pieces. Talk about getting a bad feeling about a product. I put it all back together and immediately noticed how flimsy the connections were that held the unit together, especially the water refill tank. That part of the unit just lays up against the back of the fountain. Next came the almost insurmountable task of filling the unit with water and moving it to its location. It's extremely awkward to try and carry this thing around without spilling water everywhere. I challenge anyone out there to fill the water tank and the unit and not spill water on the floor as you take it from your sink to its resting location. In my opinion, it's just an awful design. Drinkwell recommends that you clean the unit every week, but I found it too much a hassle to abide by that maintenance schedule. Inevitably, I ended up cleaning my floors as well.I was so frustrated with this unit, that I threw it out after only using it for a month. At least most of the unit was recyclable. As far as I'm concerned, that was the only plus to this pet fountain."
37834,1,Cleaning the litter box is so much easier now. All it takes is a couple minutes a day and it is clean. You just roll the box and all of the dirty litter gets trapped in the container. Finally no more touching the dirty litter. I find I clean the litter box more often now. This is a winner. The only downside that I have found is that the clips are not that strong. Mine haven't broke yet but I am prepared just in case. You can easily fix it just by using a screws or something similiar. Overall this is still one of the best litter boxes that I have tried.
198531,0,"I bought this for my 15 year old short hair pointer. She is always cold in the winter. Now that she is so old, I thought she would love having a warm spot. But she has not sat on her bed since I put the warmer in it. I think the plastic smell that it gave off the first few days caused her to dislike it. It has now been plugged in for 2 weeks, and no longer smells, but still no use. I am about ready to call it a mistake and unplug it."
110889,0,"we love the idea of draining a dog's energy, stimulating their mind, giving them a fun challenge, and feeding them all in one. we have bought a lot of the products that do just that. the buster cube was one of the first products we bought. it does what it says. the only downside is loading this thing. it takes time and is kind of a pain. we have since moved on to theKong Wobbler Dog Toy,OurPets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball, 5 Inches, andPremier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large. all of which are easier to load and accomplish the same goal."
183449,0,"I used this on my horse. I used to get Frontline Spray but they don't make that anymore so I've been trying to find an alternative. This lasts 2-3 applications on a horse. Frontline Spray lasted once so that's a plus. And this is cheaper than Frontline The first time I put this on repelled all ticks. The second time I still found several ticks. When I didn't use it I found 54 ticks when I went out for a ride! The second time when I did use the spray I found much less - somewhere in the upper teens, so it did make a dent, but I'd rather find NO ticks especially since I live in an area where lyme can be found."

155979,0,"Just a warning - this crate might abide by all FAA regulations, but if you're planning on using it to take your pet overseas, it does NOT meet IATA requirements. IATA requires that a crate have ventilation on all four sides. This crate does not have ventilation in the back.Additionally, IATA requires that ""For rigid plastic containers, the door hinge and locking pins must engage the container by at least 1.6 cm (5/8 in) beyond the horizontal extrusions above and below the door opening where the pins are fitted.""I realize that this is not advertised as IATA compliant, so I'm still giving it three stars because it seems well-made, but a little expensive."

175662,0,"Fighting the litter box every morning, trying to get all the pee blobs out of the box pushed me to purchase a metal scoop, hoping that the metal would more easily disengage the pee blob form the side of the plastic box (my one cat INSISTS on peeing in the corner, for maximum adhesion to the plastic side!). The metal part is dandy, but the handle is just too small. Or maybe my hands are too big. Either way, I generally just suffer with the plastic scoop with the larger, more comfortable handle."
184661,2,"I bought this pet carrier for my new Boston Terrier puppy - probably 5-6 pounds right now. The ""Small"" size Argo carrier is still much too big for him. However, even if it were the right size, the quality doesn't match the price of this carrier. It looks great, but 1) The holes you load the dog through on the sides are VERY small, even for my little dog - I could barely get him into the thing; 2) The inside is lightly padded on the bottom, but is covered only with hard plastic - other carriers have nice furry insides; 3) It doesn't have any pockets to hold your personal items (wallet, cell phone), or the dog's items (clean-up bags, treats, etc.). The peep hole is nice, but there's no way to cover it up (in case the dog gets over-excited in public, you want to make a quick run into the grocery without anyone noticing him, etc.) In summary, the bag looks very cute, but is not very functional. I returned it immediately."

My hedghoge spins it loose every single night-I wake up, the the wheel is on the floor of the cage with the screw that holds it in place lost in the bedding. The damn thing is loud on account of how wobbly is. My hedghhoge has actually learned to spin for a while one way, flip around and start spinning the other way just so that the wheel doesn't pop-out! Again I am sure if I go out and buy the lug-knot and bolt it to the cage some how, it might work like it's suppose to.. Considering I payed like 25$ for it and it comes with a damn stand I just expected it to work without further hassle. The cleaning sucks as well, we all know hedghogs like to poop when they run - outcome is disastrous, after 1 night the wheel looked like I hadn't been cleaned in months and it was gonna take a lot of elbow grease to clean it up."

79430,0,"I was really happy when my gates (I ordered 2 gates) arrived within 3 days. One of the gates was in perfect condition while the other gate had a broken door hinge (which is nothing more than a small wooden dowel that the door swings on). I think the construction of the doggie door was not thought out very well. It is extremely flimsie and is not built to be used very often or to last for very long. You can tell that ""cheap"" was the main concern with the company who built these gates. I'm really surprised that the gates on both were not broken during shipping. I now have to tie the door with a piece of twine. I choose not to return the gate because I needed it right away because of an elderly sick pet and I didn't want to go through the hassle of packing it up, mailing it back and waiting for a new gate to arrive. I really burns me to have had to pay for a broken gate. Other than this compliant the gates are a good height and they fit tightly in the doorways. If I had to buy gates over again, I would go to the local pet stores and check them over in person for quality before ordering."
82288,1,"Very well constructed carrier and of nice quality. This is perfect for concealing your pet when needed. There are privacy panels on three sides. The back does not have a privacy panel, but if you have all three panels down it's so dark you can't see inside. Just looks like you're carrying luggage. Who will ever know you have your pet in there! Yay! Also excellent improvement Sherpa made from previous bags such as the Sherpa Delta, is the removable waterproof bed. I had to give my Delta away because my pet pees in the carrier on car rides. I highly recommend this carrier."

89315,0,"When I purchased the original version of the Innotek Ultrasmart contain and train system, it was great. MY dog learned quick and he stays within boundaries even without collar on all the time. When I got a second dog, I ordered a second collar for ~$100. Within 2 months, I had to replace it since the glue holding on front cover did not hold and the front cover fell off, disconnecting the two small wires that control the sound. I called Innotek and got a free replacement collar. At the same time, I replaced the other ~2 year old collar since it stopped responding to the remove. This was done for $40 under limited lifetime warranty. Unfortunately, the collars have been redesigned and made with much cheaper quality materials. The collar straps are made of flimpsy rubber material. They tried to introduce a clip collar along with the buckle, but even with the clip part of the collar the buckle part is holding the clip part on. The buckle is very loose an deasily slides back and forth and with the thin, flimpsy straps, the plastic loops that are supposed to secure the length of strap easily pop off. Mine did just that so the collar came off one of my two dogs and the colar became a chew toy. Fortunately, my dog did not choke but the receiver is destroyed so my free collar replacement is goign to probably cost me another $100 to replace. I am now digging out the straps from the original receiver to put on the one remaining collar. If you are purchasing the collar to replace an old one, save the straps of the old one and use those. If you are purchasing the system for the first time, I would ask what the straps on the collars are (durable rubber or flimpsy rubber with the clip and buckle). IF it is the latter, I would request whether they have the old replacement straps or consider another system. Otherwise, there is a risk that your dog will lose the collar or choke on the parts after losing the collar."

After checking every crevice of my house for pee spots, I finally got around to checking the pads themselves. As it turns out, they are NOT completely waterproof. Apparently the plastic lining is not really plastic, because after checking the pad directly after a spill, I felt (and smelled!) urine seeping directly through the pad.I resorted to double padding, and sure enough, every urine mark leaves a shadow of urine on the pad underneath it. I suppose it's still a decent price for the number as long as there's a double layer, but these pads are still pretty unreliable."

Some of the reviews addressed difficulty with the instructions but I thought if I read them slowly and carefully enough, how difficult could it be?? Boy was I wrong! It took me quite some time to really figure it out and once I did, so much time had gone by that I ended up having to re-program the first one to coincide with the second one so that my cats would be fed at the same time. I read in other reviews that an important piece of information was omitted from the instructions and indeed it was. Heck if I know what it is now. I was so annoyed and agitated by the time I finally figured it out, that I did not take the time to write it down so I'd remember for the next time. The feeders themselves work great once programmed to perform the way they are intended. Getting them programmed was just shy of a nightmare but once programmed, they perform wonderfully. Let's just hope the batteries last a long, long time..."

Nora shakes it silly and throws it around, indoors and outdoors, and Hedgie is holding up just fine. Nora is not delicate with her toys and I've seen many bite the dust quickly.

My vet indicated that she no longer reccommends them because she knows of other dogs that throw up after chewing on Ziggies. So much for easy on puppy's stomach as they claim.If you have any question about why your pup is sick after these I would take them away and see if it clears up."
178282,0,"First off it comes in a joke of a package... Just a cardboard box with paper wrapped around the litter box... Cheap plastic... I don't understand why they thought the filter idea would work (just wanting you to buy more bs).. And beside that, i had a design flaw with what holds the filter on... The litter box IS HUGE!!!! Now some positive Comments, It keeps litter from getting thrown all over the floor... It has a nice look to it; more stylish than a standard box ... It helps keep the stench down... (JUST DON'T WASTE MONEY ON EXTRA FILTERS AND BAGS!!!) Overall I'm happy i bought it... cost 28$ buying it from AMAZON.com rather than 40$ at pet supermarket"
24086,2,"The birds eat the stuff, the only reason it isn't a 0-rating.The ""easy-peel"" packages are totally worthless - 90% of the packages are sealed so tightly that it is impossible to open the pack without using a knife and getting greasy-gunk all over the place. A simple baggie would create far less mess, and be easy to open without requiring tools. The only reason I can think of to create such a lousy package is that they pour the hot suet directly into the lower tray of the pack, and thus save time at the expense of consumer annoyance.I will never buy a Heath-brand suet product again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone but an enemy."

76075,0,"It's the best chewable habitat I've seen. We had a different model our gerbil demolished -- but that model was painted bright colors. I suspect it was somewhat toxic to chew on, though our gerbil survived.This is unpainted and seems as safe a habitat as one could buy. Only 3 issues:1. The label was a nuisance to remove.2. It's tacked together, so hope the gerbil can figure that out.3. It's made in China, so we can only cross fingers and hope it really is relatively non-toxic.Update: Well, four issues. Our gerbil is a manic chewer, and he chewed into a tack on a similar structure. He broke a tooth, which the abscessed. He's now the 150 dollar gerbil, recovering post-op. This wood hut has similar tacks holding it together. If Kangaroo recovers fully, we'll cut this structure apart and build him something held together by string."
23346,2,"This was to catch the thistle seed from falling to the ground under my feeder and making a mess, as well as to prevent so much loss of seed. However, with any rain or moisture, the seed would clump all around the tray at the bottom of the feeder, making it hard to clean as well as creating a moldy environment for the birds. I took it off and threw it away."

Although NOW I see that the description of this item has now changed to just a Waterer. That sure would have been helpful for ME.On the item itself, it does not sit well in the slot and it's difficult to manage the tiny cap once it is upside down (it's filled with water so HEAVY). You would be best to purchase another item like the pet fountain for a top fill water station."
186655,0,"First of all, these are NOT anything like the Hikari waffers I usually feed my plecostomus. They are very tiny, maybe the size of my pinkie nail (I'm a woman with small hands) rather than the large waffers that are closer to my thumb nail in size. They also resemble kibble more than they do algea waffers I've used in the past (small brownish nuggets verses flat green waffers). I tossed some in my tank but none of my bottom feeders seemed very interested in them but I'll wait and seem if they change their mind once they get hungrier.Bottom line: I cancelled my subscribe and save order and will go back to Hikari. Sure, they're more expensive but they seem to be of better quality and my fish seem to like them."
197052,1,"I got this yesterday and had it installed in a few 'short' minutes. It seems well designed and that it will do its job well. It's cheap plastic and is made in China, but seems to work.

I will update this review if I have any issues. So far, 5 stars."
77597,1,"Conures have become an increasingly popular companion pet; intelligent, affectionate, small and curious. It's this last attribute that can be a challenge to a new birding enthusiast, following around and cleaning up ""gifts"" in surprising locations.Many establishments permit birds and you find you want to take your bird everywhere.My Conure is young and not an experienced birder, after hearing about the flight suit, I decided the benefits of a leash to reduce hazards, a diaper eliminating mess and, retaining the ability of limited flight (her wings are clipped) all made sense. I didn't relish the thought of getting her to accept it though.I suppose individuality is present in all living things... my bird immediately seemed drawn to the colors and played with her flight suit a couple days before trying it on. Only slightly reluctant at first (there are many, many video experiences recorded on YouTube), my bird quickly got over her apprehension and was spreading her wings.She chews on it but a medium bird wouldn't likely ever chew threw it... its very well constructed.Aside from enjoying more freedom around the house (still MUST supervise however), she seems to enjoy public outings tremendously.Its a 'birdie' fashion accessory that we all have enjoyed so much that we ordered another one! Its great not searching for a wipe and instead disposing of a diaper. Our bird seems to know that slipping it on means fun is a few moments away.Simply a great invention !!"
68724,0,"At first my 6 month old lab mix was petrified of it, but we put it in a long soccer sock so it has a tail like effect, muffles the volume a tad and has a softer/friendlier appearance and now he won't leave it alone! Will definitely need to limit the amount of time he gets to 'kill the sock' per day. Not sure if its worth $10 since it is just a hard plastic ball that rotates between 6 annoying phrases, but ill rethink that statement on a rainy day when he is bouncing off the walls and needs something to occupy him in the house :-)"

1095,0,"I'm only giving this system three stars because the plastic bottle it comes with breaks so easily.I live in the mountains where it's very dry, so along with birdseed and peanuts for the squirrels, I provide the outdoor critters with water. I started out using a large bowl, but had to refill it too often. The animals often turned the bowl over during the night, and it just wasn't working out well.So, one day while at WalMart I saw Le Bistro watering unit and thought it would be ideal for providing water for the wildlife. And it was... for about eight months, when suddenly the bottle developed a large crack and could no longer be used. So back to WalMart in search of a replacement bottle, but none was to be found. I bought another unit and brought it home, starting over.Again, within a year the bottle cracked and I had to throw it away. Now I have two water bowls but no replacement bottle for either one. I am now on my third unit (they are so cheap, after all), but wishing I could find replacement bottles for the future. I have searched pet stores and elsewhere, as well as online, with no results thus far. I do wish this company would provide replacement bottles!"

In summary, this was money totally wasted."

44086,1,"I bought one of these about 3 months ago for my 3 cats (albeit the fugly pink one, but it was on sale... so why not?). At first they were a little apprehensive about using it (except for the pushy 3-legged russian blue) but within a day they were all lapping from it. They seem to like where the water spouts out of and rarely drink from the reservoir, but I'm fine with that.Maintenance it NOT that bad... let me explain- I own 2 50 gallon fish tanks- so cleaning this motor pump is a breeze- just a quick scrubby scrubby and all is good. The filters do need to be changed every month though of some funk builds up. My cats are pretty hands off when it comes to water so they aren't dipping their paws into it and you do need to get some food out of the dish when it falls in. Leakage- haven't noticed any- I also have it on a mat that has a rim, so were there any I'd see them. The motor is noisy when it's trying to work out all air bubbles after a cleaning (not as noisy as the fish tank motors) and it's a pretty good indicator when to add some more water.All in all, I'm happy with this product, my cat who gets bladder stones drinks much more water, and there are more pee clumps in the litterbox, so they are drinking a lot more water it seems."
205916,0,I was very happy at how fast got there. Unfortunately the dimensions were not quite right and I need to find a different one. Would probably cost more to ship back then to just keep.
178281,0,"First, like the others stated, this litterbox is HUGE. Do not get it if you don't have adequate room, as it takes up a ton of space.My cat is the type that climbs in the litterbox, hangs her behind over the side and urinates on the floor. My vet suggested the Booda Box, as that is the one she uses for her 5 cats. Bought it with high hopes....Well, my cat doesn't pee in the litterbox area of this box, she does her business ON THE STAIRS. So I am constantly cleaning the puddle that accumulates at the base of the stairs.Based on what my vet told me, this litterbox works wonders - again, she has *5* cats that use ONE litterbox, the Booda Box being it. I have ONE cat, THREE litterboxes, and she can't seem to urinate INSIDE of any of the three.... :("
128506,0,"The toy is a pretty neat idea. The company really thinks of everything. For example, the squirrels are to be placed in your dirty laundry for 12 hours to obtain your smell, making the toy more attractive to the dog. However, our Lab figured out the puzzle in about 2 minutes and then became bored with it. It's not very durable either, she chewed through the tree the second day we had it. I wouldn't buy it again."

99113,2,I bought these for my dog in heat and every one of them ended up ripping at the velcro attachment. I even got the right size. They are not flexible at all; when she sits or lays down they just rip. I've just started buying baby pull ups and cutting holes in them for her tail.
111169,0,"My only complaint about this product is, it comes in a brown paper bag that rips open very easily. It had puncture holes in it when it was delivered so the second I brought it inside it tracked through the house.

Also, as noted by other consumers, the battery runs out very quickly."
106554,0,"I agree, it is just right for a kitten, but for a full sized cat it is just too small. Mine like to scratch with their back claws, too, and it isn't big enough. And they just aren't smart enough to turn around to scratch.Some cats prefer to scratch horizontally, so the flat design gives them an alternative to scratching the carpet. I have a couple who prefer the ones made at a 45 degree angle, though. Some won't use this at all, and prefer to sharpen their claws upright, so they'll need a different scratcher.But for someone just starting off with a small kitten, it's perfect. By the time the kitten is too big to use it, it will be time to replace it anyway. I had to throw mine out before it was all scratched up, though. Because when we adopted a new kitten, one of the disgruntled elders took a mighty crap right on it, to demonstrate his disgust with the addition of the newcomer."

22119,1,I love this! I brought it home after vets and used it on my dog. I was able to create two more dogs from the hair I brushed off. No bald spots and pretty gentle too. Don't use hard pressure or it can hurt them. Then I tryed it on my cat. Which has great fur a beaver like pelt. I still got a lot of hair and the coat was even and not bald in area's. This reduces shedding and fluffs them up. I took it to my neighbor that had a calico with long fur and it fluffed her out and made her look less grease/nappy. This is one that will make you throw out all you old useless brushes.

196629,2,"What the pictures don't show is the horrible gap in the tunnel where the two sides come together. I came home to find the dog door installed by my carpenter and was sadly disappointed with the design - to put it mildly. The plastic inside puckers and pooches and does not allow a smooth flow of the two plastic flaps. For the time being I've removed one of the flaps and have nailed up the other. I am trying to train an old dog to go through, and two flaps are more than she's going to be able to muster. It is unlikely my cats will go through two flaps either as they like to be able to see what's on the other side before passing in case a dog might come barreling through. No doubt, as soon as the animals begin using it, they will be tracking dirt and fur that will get caught in the gap on the bottom and on the sides. I have sealed the gap with tape for now. The plastic is a little oversized for the aluminum, requiring a good bit of insulation. I wish I had purchased a single door model dog door unit and had the carpenter create a tunnel frame made of wood so that it would have been smoother with only one flap to deal with. If I am able, I may add a photo later."
158975,0,"My dogs lets say...aren't the most cooperative bunch. My fiance and I have probably spent over a hundred dollars on different types of leashes and slip leads trying to find out what works best for them. Both my dogs have a tendency to try and lead us on walks, so as a last resort I tried this.Fitting:As soon as we got them we tried them on both our dogs and our older dog took to it okay, he was really scared of it at first. Our youngest one however had a holy fit and started rolling around even did a back flip trying to get it off. The video DVD that came with it said that if your dog does this to adjust the lead as it may be uncomfortable for the dog. After the adjustment he was perfectly fine. One thing is, I went with a size smaller than what I would normally get for a harness or a collar. My older dog wears a medium in harnesses and collars but for this I got him a small and it fit perfectly. Same with our younger dog. He usually wears a small and I went with the petite.Walking:We too both our dogs to the park. Our older dog still managed to get ahead of us, but with a light tug on the lead he seemed to fall back in line. Our younger dog did better on it, not sure if its just hes more impressionable or what. Three days later our older dog is back to pulling at his leash again and not walking in line with us, even when we give him a tug and gorge him with treats.Overall feelings:This is probably a great product if you already have a dog that just needs a little extra guidance but its definitely not going to substitute taking your dog to a obedience class (ours are already set up to go but we wanted to try this in the meantime). The DVD video that comes with it makes it seem like your dog is going to make a miraculous change but if you notice a lot of the dogs are sitting with trainers."
90258,2,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"
158221,0,"In terms of durability, for my 20lb shetland sheepdog this crate is sufficient. I have issues, however, with the door where it seems to slide downwards so you have to lift it up a little bit to latch it shut so the black paint is wearing off the latch. I've had this crate for about a month and a half and it's been like that since I got it. Doesn't seem to be much else you can do aside from lifting the door up a little bit each time you decide to latch it closed. Aside from that it seems decent, especially for the price. I purchased mine thirty bucks on here with Amazon Prime trial (free 2-day shipping) after going to Walmart the day of my order and seeing a smaller one there for forty-five dollars + tax. I'd buy another one of these again (maybe the slightly larger version) and if I had this issue again I'd most likely return it for an exchange."
109113,0,"Updated on 2-20-12Although I still love what this collar has accomplished for my pup and our family, I feel I must comment on some major flaws that I have noticed over the last few months.My number one complaint is that it eats batteries like CRAZY! And they run about $8 every few weeks! And this is with us turning the unit off once she comes inside from doing her business and/or playing. So, I really could have invested my money in a more expensive, rechargeable collar and not had the hassle of dealing with the batteries all the time.My second complaint is that the range does not seem to be as good as stated in the description. I feel like it's much closer to a 30-40' range, which is fine the majority of the time, but occasionally she darts after something and is GONE! I really need something to get her attention when she gets further away.So, I although I appreciate the results we have achieved with this collar, I am probably going to invest in something that is rechargeable and that has a greater range.--------------------------------------------LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COLLAR!!!! And here is why.....We have a 9 month old Cavachon (Sadie) that weighs about 15 lbs. She is a VERY smart dog, however, very independent and stubborn at times. We also live on an acreage in-town so fencing in our yard was not an option. I had become concerned about her safety after she had darted across the road several times after squirrels, and also played hard-to-get after getting away from us on more than one occasion! She also likes to sprint over to visit her boyfriend's kennel in the neighboring yard no matter how much I would yell STOP! Also, with winter well on its way as well I wanted to be able to train her to go potty outside by herself, and then come back in when called. Was I dreaming or WHAT?Initially I was torn about buying a 'shock' collar and really put a lot of research into the matter. We then decided to try a vibration/beep collar first, that I bought off eBay for about $20. This started out as an okay training tool, but all too quickly she began to ignore the vibration and the beeps. A couple months went by and my frustration grew. So, after much more research and reading of reviews on Amazon and other websites we settled on this collar.The first day I took her out with a LONG leash, a pocketful of treats and the collar turned on. We started with some simple commands that she knows....like SIT and COME. I had the setting on 1 and the first time I hit the zap button when she wasn't listening she yelped and looked around anxiously. I tried it a few more times when she wasn't paying attention and she really got freaked out, jumping on me, cowering between my legs and overall just freaking out. I took her off leash and she immediately ran to our porch, just shivering and scared. I thought, ""OH NO, WHAT HAVE I DONE!"" As well as, ""I JUST WASTED ALL THIS MONEY ON THIS STUPID COLLAR!"" I took her inside, took the collar off.The next day I started her second training session and she was a little more alert, but also started freaking out a bit at first. She did the whole run to the porch and cower thing again, but this time I went over and coaxed her off the porch. She started following me around and the training seemed to go a little better.By the third day she had completely gotten it! I keep the collar on her during the day (except when she is kenneled), and only turn it on when she starts having some minor behavior problems inside (like barking at the cat or sniffing to get into the garbage), or when we are going to go outside. We now go out and walk around the yard and she stays by my side, or within a very short distance from me. I rarely have to tap the beep and almost never use the zap anymore at all! (By the way, we keep it at 1 and have never had to go over a level 3)Four to five days into the training I started getting her to go potty in the yard while I stood on the porch to supervise. She stayed right in the vicinity, did her business and came back in when called! I was THRILLED! After 2-3 days of porch supervision I let her out, watched from the window and she was absolutely perfect! Before the collar, anytime she would get out the door unleashed she would immediately bolt to visit her next door boyfriend. Now she watches me, does her thing, and comes back inside! I am completely amazed at how changed she is. It is so much more enjoyable for us to be outside now. I feel like she is safe from getting hit by a car or getting lost, and she enjoys the freedom of being off leash. I can also continue to deter her from her annoying little habits such as eating goose and deer poo as well....yum....her favorites!Now we have only been using the collar for a week or so, so I can't speak about the longevity of the batteries or remote, but I am really thrilled with this purchase so far! The batteries for the collar do seem a bit expensive (I think two at Walgreens run around $8) but are WELL worth the peace of mind this training tool has given us.Always make sure that you do adequate research and know what you are doing before you start training with this device. I hope this review helps you with your decision, and good luck with your puppy! :)"

When I put her in it during the day, by herself now that she had been taken from her litter mates, she JUMPED it each time. She is only 5.5 lbs and very small but had no problem getting over it easily. I am using it in the bedroom at night to surround her doggie bed to teach her where she is supposed to stay during the night and it works perfectly for that. It's well made, nice looking and sturdy but as others have already listed, not so hard for even a small dog to escape from easily."

I ordered it direct from the company, so it wasn't spoiled. I have to give it 1 star because neither of my cats would touch it."
101056,0,"I bought this about 3 weeks ago or so and used it immediately on an area of my carpet that had been peed on by the cat. And let me just say, this cat has the worst smelling pee of any cat I have ever owned. HORRID. I poured a good amount over the affected area and let it set for about two weeks. I gave it a good whiff and I could still smell the cat pee, but not as strong. I applied another good dose to it about 3 days ago. Yesterday I gave it another whiff and I can still smell the cat pee! It has gone from the horrid smell to a lesser horrid smell, if that makes sense. I am hoping the enzymes will keep working and in another month the smell will be gone. Maybe there is no cure for cat pee. Sigh.UPDATE 1/30/13: I have applied Nature's Miracle to the affected area of carpet approximately 3 times now since I wrote the previous review. I can notice a reduction in the ammonia smell by about 50%. I can still tell a cat peed there but it is not that horrible ammonia smell that just hits you in the face. Maybe I will try another dose and see if it improves any further."
167923,1,This is the best ball in the world. It's soft with a squeaker that does not break.

He plays with it every day and if he doesn't get to he is all out of sorts. I hope they never stop making these clutch balls.
215030,0,"It was a nice ball, but I expected better from Kong! Only took our Lab 2 days before he tore it up. Wish they would make a great ball that these big furry kids can actually get a good amount of play time with. We never let our Lab just sit and chew his balls. If we are not throwing it with him it gets put up. So that lets you know how well they are NOT made! If someone knows of a great ball that will last, Please let me know. Thanks! :-)"
39278,2,What a waste of money. Cat will not use with cover on. Does not clean itself. Only used for a couple days.
21798,1,It's hysterical to watch my keets jump through the hoops on this toy. They love using it to get between two other perches and playing with the bell on the bottom!
125470,0,"First, let me be honest. Our dachshund is a toy-destroying machine. He's taken apart high quality toys in less than 15 minutes before, so the fact this thing survived past day one is a testament to its construction.We had previously purchased an AKC duck, which lasted an amazingly long four months before being de-winged and destuffed. Based on the longevity of the duck, we decided to purchase ""Reggie the Heggie"", hoping he would give similar results.First, the hedgehog is a bit oddly shaped, which made him difficult for our dogs to carry or play with, due to their small mouths. When they finally did take an interest in the hedgehog, it was only a matter of an hour or two before Reggie's nose and mouth were gone, his stuffing completely strewn across our living room.All in all, I don't think this is a bad toy, but I wouldn't buy it for a small dog, and I probably wouldn't buy this particular animal model again. We've since purchased another duck, though it seems like our puppy has learned from Duck #1 how to dismember it more effectively. I still think the duck (or squirrel) are better, longer lasting choices."
40378,2,"Based on the high ratings this product received we invested in two of these. It has been less than two months now and both are inoperable. The latches fail to close properly after a short period of use and every time we roll the box litter pours out the back. This is NOT what you want.. absolutely disgusting! So needless to say these two relatively expensive litter boxes are on their way to the trash, and we're going back to scooping. Don't waste your money!!"
42446,1,Lilly loves her booster seat. We go to football games and travel every weekend. We travel to my son's games and it averages 6 to 7 hours one way. Lilly stays in her booster the whole time except for potty breaks.
71868,0,"Works quite well as a cat deterrent. Has a limited range and cats are smart and learn to stay out of range. If it is for a specific area it works well but if it is to be used as a general garden deterent, then it is not so good. The battery runs down quite quickly"
66320,1,"This is a great crate. I have had it for 3 years now and love it. The open top is a great feature for cleaning and removing items from inside.What is also nice, is now that my dog is older and does not need it everyday it comes apart and stores nicely."
6161,1,who would think that a product could work so well? I have used this for years with my maltese. eyes clear up quickly. i stop use after a few weeks and everything is good. so i use intermittantly as eye problems come and go.
50645,0,"Length:: 1:30 MinsFirst of all -was very happy to see a ""shipped"" notice when the day before the PJ's were back ordered. They arrived quickly-and once again the product description for the size I ordered says ""Out of Stock""But now on to the product. I have to say I am a bit disappointed in the material and COLOR, which doesn't come close to the photo. The material is thin and lightweight (how is that thermal??) I didn't purchase these to make a fashion statement or play doggie dress up---my Miniature Poodle gets COLD at night. The color-no where NEAR like the example..this is a deep muddy wine red.First time I have been this unhappy with a purchase from Amazon in a VERY very long time"
132007,0,"I ordered this with Exotic Environments Red Sea Hide-Away Aquarium Ornament and a keyboard.Both fish decor boxes mutilated, red sea decor cracked in half, while the outer box and keyboard box in perfect condition. Did the packer not notice? Or just not care?This is pretty decent in my 10 gallon, however the paint job looks rushed on it. The clam specifically looks pretty bad, like a child painted it. For the price it's nothing I'm to surprised about. I personally won't order from Amazon Blue Ribbon pet products again, but this is nice and cheap if your willing to take the risk of their product quality control and poor packaging."
154299,0,We've had the ScoopFree unit for nearly a year now and it has some good and bad features. The good news is that it works very reliably and does the best job of reducing odors and mess. It's large enough for nearly any cat and has a good strong motor.The drawbacks are as follows:1) the crystals are extremely expensive even if you elect to purchase a reusable tray and refill it manually. This method is also cumbersome and difficult as the trays are heavy and too wide to carry through doorways easily.2) only one of our cats will use the unit. The other one just doesn't like the crystals and even when we mixed in a little litter he wouldn't use it.3) the crystals do a fabulous job with solid refuse but urine is simply trapped on the bottom and stays wet until you empty the unit. This is messy and some cats just don't like having the moisture trapped under the crystals.I'd give the unit 4 stars for trouble-free operation but only three stars over-all because of the drawbacks to the crystals.Al
48444,2,"Don't buy from them, they wont let you return because the batteries are hazardous but they can ship them with out a hazardous label wonder if the post office knows about this."
192575,0,"The idea was on the right track, but it look my thirty pound dog about a minute to dislodge the ""everlasting"" treat (which took him about ten minutes to consume). He's not a power chewer either. The pockets, inside the treat ball, made my financial loss a little more bearable - the ball itself will be useful.Pros: Won't have to buy the everlasting treats every so often.Cons: Will have to find something else to occupy him."
193649,0,"This particular item is a good sturdy strong guard. However, I bought the extension which was pretty pricey. I wanted the backs of the seats to be covered to resist chewing by my dogs. They are not good in riding in vehicles in the first place. My medium size dog still managed to squeeze through and wound up on the bench seat. This dog weighs sixty pounds and still slipped through. Fortunately I bought one of the seat covers with the slots for seat belts, and had that already on there in case things like this would happen."
15049,0,This collar worked fine on our bigger dog (21 lbs) but not on the 12 lb dog that we actually bought this for. I tried adjusting the fit at different locations up and down her neck but to no avail. Maybe the problem was her hair or her breed (Dachshund mix) or something else. A spray collar worked before as far as sensing her barking so not sure what the problem was. I'm getting a little more expensive one that might be more sensitive for her.
159722,1,"I work for a large pharma company who sells their over-the-counter products to employees at their Company Store. I was surprised when the store started carrying this dog food as we have no affiliation to it. I was currently using Iams which at the time was going thru tainted ingredient issues. So I did some investigative work on some dog food review/rating websites and was pleasantly surprised by the positive reviews for this product.You can also go to [...] website for details on the holistic benefits. I switched my dogs to this food around 3-4 years ago and am so glad that I did. I just read an article on [...] which rated this brand as one of the top 4 dog foods and a ""best buy"" compared to other premium brands."
134908,1,It is quite and effecient. You don't need to change water every month.I really like this filtersystem.
118222,0,"I like the easy to clean and elevated part of this. however, I find it really difficult to get the top part back on the bottom so i never store our dogs food in it."
186596,1,"Great treat for your pets. All chicken and beef, better than the junk treats that are on the market. My cats love them. Order them on-line, much cheaper than buying in pet stores (almost half the price)."
195931,1,"When I first received these and scattered them on the floor, only one of my two cats seemed interested. The second one warmed up to them quickly though as I caught her playing with them in the middle of the night. I think if you push them down and let them spring up while the cats are watching they get more interested. The only problem is I have beige carpet making it very difficult to spot the yellow ones at times and the circumference is small enough that they easily roll under couches and anything else with a 1"" gap like a stove."
78622,0,"With one small change, this harness would get a 5 star rating from me. I made the fix myself, so I give MY version of the Easy Walk harness 10 stars (please watch the video with this review). The front-leash harness makes walking with my active standard poodle puppy fun. With a slip collar neither of us enjoyed our walks - me because I was being pulled, and puppy because I was constantly correcting her with snaps of the collar. HOWEVER - as other reviewers have stated, DOGS CAN SLIP OUT OF THIS HARNESS UNDER STRESS. My puppy did this when she encountered a favorite playmate on our walk. She rolled over on her back, legs flailing, and bingo, she had slipped the harness. (I do have it adjusted properly - I watched the video 3 times to be sure). I didn't want to give up on the harness, so I spent about 15 minutes creating a simple fix for the problem. I hope the attached video helps you. If you are using this harness now, and your dog hasn't escaped yet, please be very careful - it can happen in an instant. Dogs are born escape artists!"
208185,0,"Two out of four bags purchased have been great. Good for at least a day of chewing by our happy Lab. However, two bags must have come from old cows, because they couldn't be chewed. The dog gave up interest quickly. We tried soaking them in water, but this had little effect once the they dried. Overall, they're great whan you get a ""good"" bag!"
197919,0,Cool product with a great concept. My dogs love it. The material on the outside is well made and perfect for chewing. After fetching the tennis ball the dogs are excited to try to get it out of being hidden in another ball.
125336,0,"My 15 pound Cavalier Spaniel loved this toy, it took him longer to destroy than most of his other toys. He went straight for the paws and slowly chewed them off until he could get to the stuffing. I was quite impressed at how much stuffing this squirrel held, very big mess but oh well, my dog had a blast destroying this toy."
8459,1,Was a great height for my cocker spaniel which is keeping her head level with her food instead of her being over for it.
197394,0,"This unit works fine, but you have to keep the water level sensor clear of oxidation. I use a pencil point (minus the graphite) to scrub the small rectangle of mineral build-up. The well water we have is rich in copper, so I get a green-blue oxidation every 2-3 weeks. Vinegar sounds like a good idea, I'll try that next week. The cord holds up well to hermit crabs' claws climbing up it. I am buying a second one to start a tropical terrarium with. I use mine on a day/night aka wave-maker timer that has programmable 15 minute intervals. I use 15 minutes on, 30 minutes off."
2437,2,Did not really do anything for our dog..ended up getting a thunder jacket which seems to help a bit. It may work for your dog as I am sure not all dogs respond the same.
58407,1,"My younger lab, Bella, who is 10 months absolutely loves this! It only took her a few minutes to figure our the concept and now she's addicted. She hops around happily just when I reach for it."
204891,0,"The plecos liked the algae wafers, but their were very few of them in the package. Also, the shipping cost more than the product. It was too much money for what I got. I got some advise from the internet and am feeding them squash. They love it and it is cheap."

94150,1,Great for turtles. Don't think that this product is horrible by looking at all the reviews. Keeps my 20 gallon long tank crystal clear.
102721,0,"I was really hoping to be one of the hugely happy customers for this product, but just okay is the best I can do. We have five cats who for the most part don't scratch the furniture, but the occasional incident had turned into a bit more freguent. We decided to try a sturdier scratch post to see if that would resolve our issue. Two of our cats use the new post and the others just ignore it. We've tried the play inticements and the physical showing them the new post, to no avail. The scratch post is very sturdy, doesn't look bad in our living room, and will clearly last for a very long time."
108919,2,"Bought this trainer and it worked as described for one week. Then, the collar would shut down after a few seconds. Replaced the batteries in the collar and the transmitter but the problem persisted. It was very frustrating and defeated the purpose of the collar, by not being ready when you needed it. I am returning this product and cant recomend it based on my experience."
10139,0,"Hi,Hamster saga link (Super Pet CritterTrail Discovery Deluxe Habitat)Has plenty of room (good), slide falls down and gets SO DIRTY. Hams sleep in wheel; carry cage bigger than Discovery Deluxe (above) ; wheel fun, but FLINGS POO!!! Clean often, at least. Is big enough to comfortable hold 5 dwarf adult male hams (see Hamster Saga.) Really cool-looking; however, clean it very often. The part that holds the wheel onto the cage WILL BREAK and electrical tape hardly helps any.If worse comes to worst and you are fed up with the slide and can't stand the wheel or it breaks and you are so frustrated and tape won't help, then take out the slide, remove the wheel, and buy another wheel, attach it to the side. Still a good cage :-)So, to sum up:Pros:-Cool colors-Lotta space-Functioning water bottleCons:-Stinky slide-Breaking wheel-piece-So-so wheelPie!"
130864,2,"I wish Amazon accepted a rating of zero stars, because this is the worst litter box I've ever owned. How complicated can making a decent litter box be? The fatal problem with the two Petmate large hooded litter pans that I own is that the top rim of the litter pans are not fully covered by the hood. Therefore, cat urine constantly makes it way into the seams between the hood and the pan, and the boxes reek to high heaven even with regular scooping. Don't they test drive these things?"
65925,0,I like the concept of the clipper but have found it very bulky to maneuver. My hands are smaller and have a hard time wrapping around the base.My dog also struggles quite a bit as he had been nicked in the past from the groomer and has not forgotten. It is a struggle to do his nails in the first place so any extra time or difficulty in handling the clippers just makes my life more difficult.I love the concept of these clippers BUT found it difficult to use (some of it through no fault of the maker).
33962,1,I bought the adjustable feeder for my 70 pound black lab to help make his dinner easier to digest. The shortest setting is the perfect height for him and the bowls are more than large enough. I probably could have gotten the size smaller as the 3 quart bowls are huge. The product looks nice in my kitchen and it was shipped already assembled. I also like that the bowls are dishwasher safe.
696,0,"This is a very pretty bird feeder. My problem with it is that the squirrels figured how to climb on it and because the four feeding openings are so large the seed would fall to the ground. I found I was going through 4 lbs of seed each and finally replaced it with a ""squirrel proof"" feeder."
122544,1,I am very happy with this purchase. I spent a lot of time researching the best lamp/heater for our pet and I am very happy with this one.
155074,0,"Although well made, I did not like the embroidery on the back of the shirt. The fabric is bulky so it will bunch up around the pupster head. The waistband because made the shirt ride up around the middle. I cut a slit under the hoodie part but but it still seemed bulky. If I would have ordered a size up it would have fit better."
208850,0,"The cover is removable for cleaning but it is difficult to get back in place. The inside foam form is not real think so the sides bend over very easily. It really isn't strong enough to be a pillow, like the picture would lead you to believe."
217026,1,"The success of these toys depends on the cat. I had one cat who went crazy for them, have one cat who likes to play with them just as much as any toy, and have another who couldn't care less about them. This is a good deal for 12 mice though, and there are different textures so you can figure out which your cat likes best. My cat liked all of them and would destroy them, so it was nice to have backups."
55810,2,"I bought this product for my Sun Conure. She absolutely adored it. Without my noticing she had chewed a small hole in the center lining. I woke up this morning to find that she had crawled through the hole and was completely contained within the center lining and was helplessly trapped. I had to cut the lining to remove her only to discover that she had also become entwined in threads that were wrapped around the base of her wing. These had to be carefully removed to prevent her from breaking her wing during her panic. She was very quiet while she was fully inside the lining. My casual observation just indicated she was sleeping in late. If I had not noticed she was trapped before leaving for work she would not have lasted the day. If you have a bird that has somewhat destructive tendencies, PLEASE be careful with this product or any other similar products that are sewn to create pocket of material. I will not replace her house with this or any similar houses based on the design, much to her dismay."
137509,2,I got this for my dachshunds they tore all the fuzzy yellow off on the first day! Its a no go for dauchshunds!
50561,1,Have used this and the grey slicker brush since my Goldendoodles were pups. It is the best and the handles make brushing a breeze. This brush and a comb and my doodles look fantastic!
53527,0,"I'm not sold on this one. It might have helped but it isn't as effective as they claim. If your dog is eating thier poop, the best way is to keep an eye on them when outside and train them to leave it be. This didn't help much...if at all."
79227,1,"This item seems to be the one people buy when they can't tame their dogs to wear The Gentle Leader which is also made by the same company. I have to say that this product works well but in my opinion The Gentle Leader is so much better. The Easy Walk effectively does stop the pulling, but makes your dog look like a working dog. On my lab it looks like he is a rescue dog lol. He wears a large and he is about 65lbs.It has adjustable straps everywhere to make it fit, but it can be a little tricky getting it right. I noticed on my other dog(55lbs) it was impossible to have him wear it. Because of his build, The large would be a tad big fully adjusted for him, and the medium was a tad bit too small, so I got the gentle leader instead, which has been awesome so far. For those of you who return The Gentle Leader for this, watch the DVD for it before you return it, it shows you how to put it on very well, also local pet stores will teach you how to use it as well."
116971,1,I bought this tank for my betta and he was very happy in it. He loved to hide behind the ship cutout. The whole effect with the little decals and such was adorable. My betta also loved having the extra space to swim around. I bought a small heater for winter. I tried the small Marina light that snaps on the top but it was partially blocked out by the black top. The filter did a surprisingly good job of keeping the water clear and was very easy to clean.
210571,0,"(Sept. 18, 2010) Well, the day after I originally wrote the review and gave the litter box 5 stars, the conveyor stopped working. The litter pan still rotates, but the conveyor does not carry the waste to the basket. It has only been in service a month. If the situation improves, I will update. Right now, I have got to de-rate it from 5 stars to 3 stars because I am hoping that the prob is something like a piece of plastic is jamming it as has been mentioned in other posts. If it is, I will come back and update. However, I still think that it is a pretty helpful product when it is functioning correctly.___________________________________________________________________So far, the Petsafe continuous clean litter box has made one major chore happen less frequently. All I do at the end of the week is remove the bagged waste and put another bag in the container. It is quiet. To get your cat acclimated, justlet your cat's regular box get full of litter. While the old litter box is still full of litter, sit the Petsafe next to the old one but don't plug it in. My kitten used it right away. After the 1st day, I plugged it in. My cat that usually jumps when hearing any new sound, just looked at the Petsafe and used it anyway.Thus far the best litter that I have found that works with it is the Arm & Hammer. I have tried the natural wood micro wood chippings, but I think that they are too fine for the system to transport. Instead, these pile up at the entrance of the converyor and I have to use a small scoop to shovel the wood chips away from the area.I also use Glad pet carpet powder. Occassionally, I sprinkle some into the litter box.My friends say that they can't even tell that I have a kitten. They compare the smell(or lack of)in my house with other pet owners' homes that they have visited.I actually recieved it a few weeks before I took it out of the box. I thought that I was going to have to ""assemble"" something. I wanted to wait until I had time to deal with a project. It wasn't a big deal. It was as simple as taking the unit out of the box and snapping this or that on...about 10 minutes.It has only been a month. If I have anything major happen after this review, I'll come back and update. Right now, I'm really thinking about buying a 2nd one just in case these folks stop selling them. It works just that good!!"
60998,0,decent quality but smaller than you expect. Probably too small for a big dog like a lab.

58458,0,"i bought this thinking that it was a really good idea to keep the pup busy, but upon introducing it to my boston terrier, he was a bit hesitant about approaching the toy. i think it's the spikey round opening of the container. plus, he's not a ""puller"" so he hasn't quite figured out how to get the treats out. it's been more frustrating than fun for him thus far. all in all, a nice idea but not an intuitive toy for dogs."
178083,2,"I purchased this product to try to keep my basset hound from getting into the cat's litter box and helping herself to ""treats"". Needless to say it failed in that task, but the issues with this litter box go even further than that. The filter cover doesn't stay closed (I had to secure it with some twist ties), the top doesn't stay on, and it doesn't really eliminate the spread of litter if your cat is anything but clean with tracking litter. The footprint of the box is much wider than a traditional litter box. I thought it would solve several problems, but it solved none."
113162,1,"I gave this to my cockatiel by mixing it into her food. She eats it and is noticeably healthier for it. The reason I chose this is because it isn't riddled with artificial ingredients, dyes, and preservatives like many other vitamins. This seemed the most healthy choice for my bird and as proof, she is doing well. Bottom line: it works."
27460,0,"I was hoping for better results from the barking collar. Although it seems to help a little, there are still times when the collar doesn't seem to startle my dog enough to get him to stop barking. I would not purchase it again, knowing what I know about it, and the cost of it."
170395,0,"This looked just right for our bichon, but it was too long in front and would have had to be cut. Bichons are long, similar to Dachs. but with longer legs and also are wide around neck--we needed to get a fitting at a pet store."
189656,1,"I wanted a seat cover that would protect not only the seat itself, but, the backs of the front seats as well. This hammock does the job and then some. It protects the back seat, the floor, and the back sections of the front seats. Drool and dog hair are contained within the hammock, and it attaches to the front & back seats so it stays in place.The front of the hammock attaches across both front seats so that it deters my dog from trying to get into the front seat. I also use a pet seat belt to secure my Basset Hound so that she will not be hurt in case of a sudden stop or accident.If you are looking for something to keep your car pet hair free, then this product is for you. It also comes with covers for the headrests to keep them clean as well. It is made of a heavy material so that it will not be ruined by dog nails or chewing. It is machine washable so that you can keep the hammock cleanI highly recommend this hammock."
22603,0,"Have the large furminator for our golden and retriever which works great. Was using on the 7.5# cat! So I thought it would be a good idea to purchase a smaller style made for felines. I frankly accomplish what I need to do with the larger tool, and didn't need to spend the money on another. I don't think it works with the same ease or gives quite the same results. Perhaps it is what I am used to; whatever, my cat loves to be furminated with either."
120948,2,"I got this filter last December for a 10 gallon setup filled with minnows. It did a good job filtering until about June when it started to get finicky (I would have to unplug and replug a few times to get it working again). Then about two weeks ago it just gave up, outright.I gave it two stars because when it worked it did it's job. I'm just upset that it only worked properly for 6 months and then stopped working outright after 8 months."
107407,0,"I ordered this for my dog to travel to NJ. She wants to stand the whole way and needs to be secured. The straps do not allow her to stand, they forced her to sit. And when we had to quickly hit the brakes, the carrier did stay in place, but the straps came loose and she flew out of the bed while still partially attached. it scared me. The bowl is a good idea, but it doesn't actually fit as they show it and it doesn't secure. So that part is actually worthless. My dog is part Pomeranian, sorta tall and only weighs 14 lbs. For a smaller dog, this might be fine, but definitely not for a dog over 10 lbs. I would actually say more for a miniature dog. Shipping was great and quick and so far the return seems easy, with them providing the return tag."
54716,2,Earlier today I purchased this product while at Petco at the glowing recommendation of an employee there. My dog licks constantly night and day. As I type this I am watching her lick her foot with great attention and relish in the exact spot I sprayed this stuff a few minutes ago. So much for Fooey...
151963,0,"Great idea and looks great in the pictures and packaging, however... the handle, when retracted, doesn't really conform to the shape of the collar and stays mostly straight and awkward looking. For the price I paid, $4.99, I can live with that but retail, I think around $20, would be asking a bit much. Also, when you pull on the handle hard enough to make it work, the collar pulls so far away from the neck that an out-of-control dog could probably slip out. Also, the little name tage retainer under the handle tore, rendering itself useless, on the 1st test pull of the handle. Other than that, it's a just another good, sturdy collar."

40931,2,"All I can say is - DO NOT BUY! This gate is NOT secure and can break in ways that can be dangerous. My 2 year old can work the latch. I bought it to keep my two German Shepherds in the back room of our house, because it is advertised for big dogs. Within 24 hours the hardware on the bottom was bent so badly it did not function, from my dogs merely putting their paws on the top of the gate and pushing on it with their noses to try to move it. We straightened it back out so we could use it again. We didn't use it for almost a month, then put it back up. My SIL's 35 lb collie mix managed to snap one of the upright dowels in half with his teeth and pulled it out of the gate. My smaller dog got himself stuck at the hips trying to follow the smaller dog through the gate, and the other one got her head stuck in it. I'm returning it to PetCo. I paid $70 for this gate and it's not worth $20."

And I didn't intend for it to be a chew toy...However just out of curiosity I experimented with this with my AmStaff and he was able to chew off a corner of the handle in about 5 mins. It will have to be a dog park toy where he likes to run around and play keep away with other dogs.About the only toy he can't destroy is the black Kong.So this will have to be an ""active"" play toy, and not left out where the dog can work on it.Should be just fine to play fetch with though."

Looks like water damage.The magnet for the door is very weak. It would open as the cat exited the unit.Overall Its OK. If I had payed full retail price, it would of been on a truck back.Some glue and a new magnet and it's good for the basement."

However, our English Bulldog, who is generally not picky at all, will not eat the stuff. We've tried multiple ways of giving it to him, but each time he refuses to eat.Eventually we have gotten him to eat it, however I've noticed that he has gotten sick several times subsequent to eating the product. Again while it may work, beware that it does not agree with all dogs tastes or digestive systems. Needless to say we are disappointed."
84080,1,"Our dog Selby just loves this toy - he sleeps with it, drops it at our feet for ""fetch"" and uses it to push a tennis ball around. It is very durable - we play tug with it and he hasn't managed to pull off the ear or the tail. We've washed it a couple of times and it still looks great. I would recommend any of the Dr. Noys plush toys."
171228,0,"Before I bought this, I was stepping on crystals all the time. This did a good job getting all of them and made it easy to dump them back in the box. One of my cats wasn't a big fan of the texture and I caught him trying to go around it or sneak in the litter box from the side (which doesn't work if you have the hood). I didn't want to give him reason to dislike using the litter box, so I stopped using this."

My little one was a rescue and was just recovering from mange when I got him. A few weeks later we started to give him the daily greens product and over the next few months his coat started to come in smoother and his temperament grew brighter. Now he is a rambunctious 1 year old, full of pep and energy and I think that no small part of this is due to his treatment of Daily Greens. I would recommend them to any and all pet owners."

45868,0,"My experience with the product (used on 3 dogs of various breeds and personalities) was a mixed success. Without question it discourages pulling on the leash, and definitely made walks much easier in all 3 cases. Controlling a dog is definitely easier with the Gentle Leader, and it is very easy to slip on once you get the hang of it.We worked with a very good trainer for 2 of the 3 dogs, and each dog was desensitized to the Gentle Leader by trainer.However there were issues with all 3 dogs -1) Each dog commonly will stop its walk and try to ""paw"" the gentle leader off of its nose. This happens on average once per walk, and no amount of correction seems to stop future ""protests."" Indeed I do not believe the dogs enjoy wearing them.2) The piece which attaches to the leash hangs down so that a dog can chew on it. I have one lab mix which becomes aggressive when he sees another dog or cat while on a walk (and yes we are working on this issue). The lab mix turns his aggression on the Gentle Leader and chews on it HARD. We had a close call recently where he literally chewed all the way through the connection while we were walking him. Luckily I caught on quicker than he did, and was able to attach the leash conventionally to his collar before he bolted after a neighbor's cat.3) Our smallest dog is a 16 lb Chiweenie. He seems to shut down with the Gentle Leader and is more likely to cease walking altogether when wearing it, than he would be otherwise.At this point, we feel like the Gentle Leader helped us with our dogs' walks but also may have provoked some unwanted aggression and protest. We are currently looking for an alternative, and are considering Illusion collars (or something similar) as we are not comfortable with pinch/choke chains."
184773,1,"My Rottweiler pup, developed a UTI caused by struvite crystals at around 11 months. It cost a bundle to clear it up for her, but she's worth it. She went through the anti-biotics and the vet put her on the prescription food. The food is a name brand and it is VERY expensive. It was running me around $75.00 (30# bag)every three weeks. I did my research online. I found that the prescription food really isn't very nutritional. It worked to keep her clear, but the vet said, down the road it could acidify her urine too much. I won't let her suffer a moment if I can help it. I've found that using these tablets helps protect her urinary tract, along with a supplement called D-Mannose, that clears out the crystals. I am able to feed her a better nutritional food and keep her clear using natural ingredients. She likes the tablets and the tabs are easier to use than powder form. I bought both of these supplements on Amazon.com."

I'm not sure what kind of cats they tested on, but I've never had a cartridge last two weeks, which is the advertised length of use for two cats. I average about one week to 10 days, and ten days is stretching it. At $15 dollars a cartridge, it starts to get expensive.Basically it keeps its promises, however it does so for a price."
35901,0,"We bought the gentle leader based on favorable reviews from others who have used it. The head collar works great, but it has a couple flaws.First, there is little to secure the neck collar from getting loosened or reset. The only thing to secure the sizing of the neck collar is the latch itself, which can easily loosen or reset when the collar is not being worn. We find ourselves refitting the collar every other time we put it on.When the collar is worn, the excess portion of the collar will dangle with no place to secure it. We knotted it a couple times to reduce the length, otherwise it would disturb the pup. Most quality collars will use two points to secure the collar and secure the excess, but not the gentle leader.Second, the nose loop wears down bald spots on our dog's snout, just under his eyes. This is supposedly remedied with a deluxe version using felt, but Amazon does not appear to carry it."

158178,0,"We got this crate for our new greyhound, not know how big she would be. She was less than 60lbs. We put this crate together before we got her, and noticed the plastic hinges. While the crate assembled VERY easily, made so by the plastic hinges, we wondered about those hinges. While our new grey is not a chewer, if someone had a dog that chewed, those hinges would be toast. As it was, our new grey did NOT like her crate at all, and bent the bottom of the door opening her first night. After less than 2 weeks, that crate was in the garage, and our grey has freedom throughout the house. So the plastic hinges and the easily-bent frame is why this crate got only 3 stars. But it did just open up to assemble; very easy."
164900,1,"What can I say?! Kongs are the best, especially if you crate train your dogs. I have two Siberian Huskies, and being highly intelligent, when in their crate they must be preoccupied. I alternate a set that I keep in the freezer filled with peanut butter. As soon as they see me reach into the freezer, they both dash into their crates! For the money, you can not find a more durable treat. My male will rip through any (I mean any!) ""durable"" toy. After months with a red it has only tiny wear marks around the big hole, therefore I switched him to blacks and the female inherited the reds. Next to each other, the Kong is their favorite pastime."
133396,0,"The product is fine, but the price is ridiculous. The description did not list how many are in a pack, but there are only 3, which means you are paying more than $3 per twist.

These are gigantic, and my dogs spent a couple hours entranced with them (the older dog actually gave up and left his for the younger dog)."

I'm on the 4th can of the second case and they all seem to have too much moisture and are a soggy mess. I have to refrigerate the can for a day before opening it so that I can portion out his food. My dog is less thrilled with the mess and I can't even warm it quite to room temperature before he'll refuse it. I don't know if the food was stored improperly at Amazon, if something happened in the shipping, or if Natural Balance doesn't have good quality control and ""bad"" cans seem go to Amazon but I haven't had the same problem with the cans that I buy at the Petco store."

Now he won't even eat the empty pill pocket. =/The pills are Gel capules and hardly fit in the pill pocket (I had to use 1 and 1/2 pill pockets to fully cover the gel capsule)...maybe thats why this didn't work..If you have a smaller pill it'll probably work better.*I might give the chicken flavor pill pockets a try, heard they're a bit bigger then Salmon pill pockets."

So I got my hubby after it he used some industrial ties to close up the crack, THAT worked for another day and then the whole thing that attaches to the stand cracked almost all the way off. I really like this wheel because it looks cute and it is pretty much TOTALLY SILENT (only the stand makes loud noises as it hits the glass aqarium floor so if you buy this be sure to put a little extra bedding in and set it on top) but I wouldn't recommend it for hamsters it would probably work excellent for a mouse but the company just didn't design it sturdy enough for anything heavier than that."

It is now just lying in the basement on a shelf and wil probably just go in the garbage very soon. I can't really give it away knowing that someone would have to invest in the replacement cartridges.

147336,2,I bought this for our new dog that barks ALL THE TIME. It zapped him once on the first day then nothing after that. I took out the battery to reset it and it zapped on the first bark then nothing after. It now doesnt zap him at all or it is so faint that he doesnt care. I have a training collar that zaps also. It has settings for 1 through 10 (10 being strongest). I can put on level 1 and hit the button and he responds. I have used on myself and it is a very faint shock but enough to stop in his tracks. This barking collar must not even be that strong. It is a total waste of money and time. having to take out the battery for 1 minute to reset it is crazy. It should just shock and that's it.

I bought one about 2 years ago, and I had to have it replaced 3 times because of it breaking apart, leaving a much bigger mess to clean up than just changing the litter, and while their customer service is very helpful, their product is literally garbage.

At first, he seemed to like this fountain, but after a while, I caught him drinking out of the toilet again. Obviously, that's a behavior issue. But this fountain turned out to be more trouble than it's worth. Despite the reservoir, it would often start making gasping noises which indicated it needed to be refilled. These noises freaked the cat out. I needed to clean cat hair out of the bowl every other day and today, when I went to clean it out, I noticed that there was mold growing in the crevasses. There was no discernible way to take it apart and take care of that so I have no choice but to get rid of it and go back to the bowl. I doubt my cat will notice the difference.

A few times she caught it, and tried to carry it away to ""kill it"" which means it is extremely realistic. It flutters very nicely and realistically as it flies through the air, which is really what gets her ramped up. It's nice that it comes with extra attachments and is replaceable, which means I don't have to worry about her destroying it. After we were done playing she followed me around, meowing, as if to ask what happened, I was having so much fun!It's hilarious to watch her jump, stalk and kill it, as if she was some grand lioness. lol I feel like we are going to get tons of use of it in the future"

I would have given this item 5 stars if there were some way to actually use the filter that came with it.There's a hole in the top of the box near the handle which looks as if it is designed for another piece of plastic or something to fit into it, possibly to hold the filter. There was no smaller piece included in the shipment, however, so the filter is useless and the box only gets 2 stars instead of five.Hey Amazon, this box STINKS the way it is!!!This item is far too expensive (for a cat box) to be either: a) designed poorly, or b) shipped incompletely."

6550,2,"After reading glowing reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try because of my Shih-Tzu's problem with tear staining. I tried sprinkling it on his food (canned) but he refused to eat it. I then mixed it in the food, but he still knew something was in there and wouldn't gobble it up like he always did. After about 3 weeks on it he started vomiting almost on a daily basis and his stools were very loose. I stopped it immediately and, after 2 weeks, he's back to himself again. I'd rather put up with the tear stains than give him stuff like this which made him sick."

153109,1,"After seeing the hit and miss reviews I bought my catgenie and hoped for the best. Almost 6 months now and not looking back.Initially it was horrible. Only one cat would use it and we have four. Then we completely took away the litter box. We had 3 cats using it and one that refused. After several weeks of trying everything and dealing with poop on the floor we started placing our last cats poop in the cat genie. He would poop on the floor and we would put it in the contraption, simple as that. Then he finally got the picture and started using it.There are several things on instructables.com that came in handy. The drain hose on ours is routed in the toilet now so that it goes down the trap and doesn't create poop soup in the toilet bowl. Also knowing how to use a power drill to drain down the unit is a lifesaver.As for operational problems. The catgenie does not like to be turned off for extended periods of time. This can cause the poop in it to harden and cause more problems. Also if the unit floods with water and you let it sit, ie the wife shuts off the thing that keeps beeping, the water sensor will get dirty and you will have to clean it.As for the poop soup in the machine people complain about its really simple, if the water sensor gets dirty this happens. Taking the unit apart and cleaning the water level sensor takes 5 minutes.After figuring out all those problems though the catgenie works like a champ. We are going to purchase another here soon to keep the cats from bugging when there is poop in the machine and they need to use it. Four cats is too many for one catgenie.If you can make it through the first month it's smooth sailing after that. Well worth the cost and initial hassle.****************March 09Still going strong. I refill my own cartridges now with no hassle. There are kits available, but if you have a little electronics know how then reprogramming the chip is easy and a lot cheaper. (Around $30 for an I2C programmer) I also have created a litter trap to keep the pellets from going into the toilet, so far so good on that. I will post an instructable on how to make your own as soon as I am sure I have all the kinks ironed out.As a side note, do not try to have four cats using the same catgenie. You end up with poop on the floor and a rush order to amazon."

When I first got him we were living in a condo in the Las Vegas and was much too hot for his paws to go out for ""potty breaks"" during the day. He got use to using Wee-Wee pads during the daytime and went out at night.We moved a few months later to a cooler climate but my work schedule was so chaotic that I never knew when I'd be home to let him out. He was wee-wee pad trained. So I'd leave a wee-wee pad out for those times when I couldn't make it home in time or when he was on allergy medicine that made him drink more water than normal.... and he'd use them.5yrs have past and I still leave one out for him but normally I return home to find it dry and I let him out and that's that... but for those times when I do find it wet or when he has been ill I'm glad I left them there since I have little to no mess to clean.(Note: these are also great for Seniors who can't take their dogs out or who do not want to go out after nightfall).~FallenMoon"
78307,0,"My husband and I purchased an aquarium similar to this and the results are beautiful, after a little TLC. We had no room on the floor for a large aquarium like I wanted, but when we saw this, it definitely met our needs. Like all small aquariums, one must realize the following: 1) small tank = small fish, 2) the number of fish for the space is limited, 3) small environmental changes = big changes to the aquarium, and 4) it's a tank with fish, and it needs to be cared for like any other pet home. One challenge is water changes, but most gravel cleaners will fit, and with a stepping stool for assistance, it is very doable challenge. Once the tank does stablize, as it did with us, it is an amazing addition to the house."

Complained to the seller by phone and got nothing...they said I could return the bags which would have cost as much as I paid for them.So, I called Bags on Board who apologized profusely, said they have discontinued these bags due to complaints like mine, and agreed to send me several rolls of rectangular bags for free. They did, indeed, send me 12 rolls and 5 coupons worth one dollar each towards the purchase of more bags. I really appreciated the way they stepped up, unlike this seller.

26267,1,"I use this as a daily grooming comb for my ""mutt"" cat -- she's technically a shorthair, but the fur is longish to the point that people will occasionally ask if she's a Persian. In addition, both the coarser outercoat and the very fine but dense undercoat shed tremendously.I first encountered this comb brand when she was a kitten and the vet used it to demonstrate how much loose fur we were missing when we groomed her with a no-name discount store ""cat brush."" He had these combs for sale so I bought one on the spot. Now, 10 years later, I needed a second comb -- not because anything was wrong with the first one, but to resolve a household dispute over whether the comb should be in my room, where I usually groom my cat, or in another house area where it would be accessible to everyone else. (I know, fascinating.) So I bought this.As it turns out the comb I already had was not the ""extra fine"" like this, but the effect is pretty much the same. The only difference is that I have to pull fur off the comb teeth more frequently as I'm grooming -- otherwise the comb teeth get slightly bent apart due to spaces between them being so narrow compared to the size of the loose fur clumps. This might be an issue if your pet's coat is very thick or coarse, but in that case I would still recommend this comb albeit in a different size. It's sturdy, effective, and pretty easy to clean."

I also have to deal with a chewer, so try to buy toys for hard chewers. This is not one of my favorite toys, although I love the Premier brand. My 15 lb. maltese had this toy for approximately 15 minutes when all the treats were gone and he had already sort of bent one side of it from chewing. Also found that when I screwed the two pieces together to match up the release point, it was either too small or too large for the treats I used. Try the Premier waggle or busy buddy."

As far as the product itself goes its glued together so it either sticks or if your's does not stick it means they did a bad glue job also I wouldnt call this the best woodcraft job either the backing does not meet the side ends but its close enough. Mine happen to come with a 2"" split in the wood but its not a full split just half way up on the bottom side which is why I didnt notice it right away."
155903,2,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"
199333,1,"this is a great product-no doubt about it. for me, however, it was a waste. my dog has odd silky/kinky hair and it wouldn't go through his at all. i tried it on my long-haired cat and it was fabulous. the only drawback to that was that he is an indoor cat and there was no place feasible for me to brush him without the hair flying literally all over the room. it almost worked too good on him! anyway, i gave it to a friend who will get a lot of use out of it, i'm sure."
167450,0,"These markers allow for deep, vibrant color. They blend well, don't bleed through thick fabric, and only with extended use does the pen tip wear from its pinhead size (which makes it great for detail work). However, ""extended use"" for these pens is a relative term - using them on 100% cotton knit, I only fully covered an area about 4""x4"" before the ink started to fade to pastel, and I had to color twice as much to get color for about a square inch, until it ran out completely. I took the pen apart to see if it had really run out of ink that fast - it had. I'm sure that 4""x4"" estimate may vary depending on the opacity of the color you want, how hard you push down, etc., but I was unsatisfied. At $10 a box, you'd think these things would last longer. Perfect for small designs, bad for large ones.As the box says, ironing is not necessary but recommended. I find that when ironed on, there is practically no way to get the ink off- I have a t-shirt that I made with these in middle school, and it's lasted for almost ten years and hundreds of washes."
78464,1,"Definitely reduces dogs and especially puppies from straining and pulling on a leash due to the design of an across-the-chest, rather than around-the-neck, leash. For some reason most dogs don't seem to mind gasping and choking on a regular collar with a leash which pulls from the top, which is a strain on the dog and the owner. But they behave differently when the leash is a harness which pulls evenly across the chest and to the side. If you are leash training your dog or puppy, using this harness with a retractable leash is not recommended as the dog gets the wrong message about not pulling. Be careful about sizing. Use girth and weight rather than dog type listed in the site as the small is really for dogs under about 25 lbs, with the medium for about 25-50 lbs."
160724,0,"I've had this item for a few months. When I received it, my cat, who was then 3 months old, played with it for a few minutes, then completely ignored it. Now that Jasper is 7 months old, he's still ignoring it and his lack of interest is not improved by a smattering of catnip (he does like catnip, so that's not the issue). Part of the problem is that when he used the scratching board, the light plastic frame would slide around, and he could never get a good grip without pulling the frame off of the floor. Sort of defeats the purpose.Second, the toy is too small. I have a vertically standing, large, cat scratching pole that Jasper can stretch on while he scratches. I think he prefers being able to extend his body while scratching with two or all four of his paws, which is not possible with this toy. In addition, he may just not like the cardboard's texture on his paws/claws.Judging from the previous reviews, I think my cat might be the anomaly. He's normally not a picky or finicky cat (will eat anything, walks on a leash, likes water, and will poop anywhere with sandy/litter-like texture :p) and he loves to play (especially when a person is involved) but he just isn't interested in this toy."

The litter ended up all over my room and the dust from the litter left prints on my bed rugs basically everything. This litter is much better than others but you will have to clean up around the litter box a lot! My cat would get this litter stuck in his paws! I must admit it is pretty expensive but if you have a small cat and you buy an enclosed litter box and a really amazing rug/mat you should get it.

I believe that this is an ancient model pulled off some warehouse self. It's from 2004, and I'm positive that they have come out with a newer model. Either that or this is a complete rip off from some other company. The box seems fishy and the pump itself is much darker than the ones you get at the store. However, the pump does seem to work. I was just very disappointed in the loudness of it. I think that there is the newer model for sale on Amazon too... and this one is only 1 or 2 dollars more.

The top part that looks like a window does not need to be installed if you have a small dog that won't try to jump over it. There are flat metal bars that slip down inside and provide stiffness and height. it seems pretty expensive for what it is. One of the cheap plastic hold down clips has already broken.Update: I called Kurgo and they happily shipped me a new plastic clip.

57275,1,"Sure Frontline Plus for Cats costs more than what you MIGHT be tempted to buy Over The Counter at the drug store or the Supermarket -- but those OTC products have killed or neurologically (seriously) damaged too many cats and dogs-- and I wonder why those OTC products are still being sold. As a new pet owner 20 yrs ago, I almost killed my cat with an OTC product-- I frantically called the vet immediately -- seconds after applying it and seeing my cat have a reaction -- and luckily all I had to do was put my cat under a warm shower and wash her off -- if I had waited any longer I would have had to take a very sick cat to the vet, with no guarantee of a full recovery.That being said, paying a little extra for Frontline For Cats is worth it -- in the long run you pay MUCH less than you would have to pay if you had to tke your cat to the vet for a life-threatening reaction to an OTC flea product(make sure you get a Cat product and not a Dog product as Cats' livers process chemicals differently than do dogs' livers- i.e., a cat CAN get poisoned by a dog product)Frontline Cat Plus starts working in (as I have observed) less than 24 hours-- make sure you apply it as indicated on the package. My Big Bad Baby Twinkle cat can turn her head almost 270 degrees, and she tries to lick it off the back of her neck, so I have to put a (soft) Elizabethan collar on her and monitor her for about 12 hours to make sure she doesn't walk into walls (that collar may impair her line of vision).Please DO montior your cat to make sure s/he does not have a (rare but it may happen) reaction to Frontline, but I have never seen that happen in all my 3 cats. At any sign of a reaction call the vet immediately.Other than that, when the fur dries, your cat is protected very well. Then it's up to you to remove the source of the problem - the fleas -- in blankets, bedding, on rugs, etc. Ihad to do that-- it was a chore but it certainly was worth it -- for me AND for my cat(s). If the infestatin is very heavy, please call your vet to see what else can be done. (I had to do that too)"
49429,0,"I got this comb because fleas were slipping through the single row comb I had. With this comb they did not slip through, they got trapped between the rows and then it was really difficult to get them out.

So it was effective and I am still using it. But it seems there should be something better."

The newer retractable leash is a re-design of the old great leash but the handle is 'Fat' and not comfortable in my hand like the old thinner one with finger molds.Some apparently 'new graduate ergonomics engineer' probably newly hired at half his early retired predecessor's salary, thought they could make an improvement 'NOT'. The handle is uncomfortable and the more I used it the more it annoyed me. I finally heated up a metal pipe with a torch and 'modified the handle' by melting it to try to match the older one. This helped a lot but it still wasn't perfect.Several weeks later , I ran into some of the older design Flexi 10' leashes and bought 5.

194854,2,"The beef formula has changed.They used to be soft and pliable and I could easily hide her medicine in them and she ate them instantly. Now they crumble as they are not as soft. I checked the new product date and it stated ""Best Before"" Oct 27th 2014.The first 5 ingredients has change from Beef, Ground Rice, Ground Oats, Malted Barley, Gelatin; to Beef, Potatoes, Tapioca, Vegetables Glycerin, Gelatin.The new recipe also includes Rosemary, Turmeric, and Sage that the old one doesn't have. The new formula has also removed the ground flax seeds that the old one had. Lastly, the ingredients on the old recipe states fresh apples, fresh carrots, fresh blueberries; and the new recipe states apples, carrots, blueberries.I had a few of the old style and gave her one without any medicine and she ate it right away. I then gave her the new style without any medicine and she sniffed at it then turned her head and she wasn't interested. I put it in her dog dish and it's still sitting there.Some dog may like the newer formula but little Daisy does not, and I had no idea that the formula had changed. I reorder without reading any reviews because she loved the taste but it appears others have experienced the same thing:http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SQXLGU8NVGBT/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1SQXLGU8NVGBT (copy and paste to view)Old style on Amazon (Blue bag) http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPYNew style on Amazon (Maroon bag) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1C8Currently there is no picture/image available on Amazon site for the new style so there was no way to notice the packaging had changed colors."

83940,0,"I ordered this product out of curiousity and because of all the positive reviews. My cat would sometimes eat our plants or our neighbors' plants so I thought this product would stop her from doing that. However, whenever she'd eaten a plant, my cat would always end up throwing it up because she couldn't digest it. I thought that she would be able eat and digest this product since it's ""pet greens garden wheat grass."" I had no problem with the growing of the grass. Actually, it grew beautifully (took about 5 days to really start growing out of the bag). However, my cat cannot digest this grass either. Multiple times now she has eaten some grass only to throw it up about 5 mins later. I am somewhat disappointed in the product."
141426,1,"I was hoping this would come pre-assembled. No such luck. It was a chore to put together. I did put it together myself and was completely finished in 3 to 4 hours. I found the directions to be rather confusing and hard to follow. I ended up tossing them aside and put it together based on the one front picture (on the directions). Once I got the frame put together and standing up (which took awhile), I put on the wire fencing. From the previous comment, I was kinda worried about the wire fencing. The fencing was very easy! It came bundled up very neatly and easily unwound. Before I picked it up or moved it, I found one of the ends(sides) and slipped the skinny rod through it. I then picked it up vertically and attached the one side to the frame and then unwound it around the frame to the other side and attached it. It went so smoothly and easily. I couldn't believe it. It fit perfectly. I do agree with the previous comment that I wish the wire ties were a bit longer . . .but they do work fine. Overall, a very nice looking kennel and will last forever. I am very happy with it."

91887,1,"My golden retriever puppy loves this toy! It is by far her favorite. Not only is it a great toy to play fetch with, but it also doubles as a tug toy. My dog loves to play tug with it, then, when she get it all to herself she will hold it from the rope part and toss it around in her mouth all by herself! It's a great way to keep her entertained by herself. Just make sure that you supervise your dog when playing, as my dog has gotten the rope part stuck over her head and/or legs before so don't let your dog play with it when you are not home."

After smelling it, he doesn't even want to lick or play it with. A real bummer."
171613,0,"The surfact of the seat cover is indeed heavy-duty as described. It is a neutral color so it blends nicely in my car.Since this is a one-size-fits-all cover, it doesn't fit my car very well (in my opinion, one size fits all means it doesn't fit anything). That is not totally unexpected. I don't have headrests but I was able to loop the straps around the back of my seats when folded down then closed it back up. That works relatively well. Unfortunately, the lower straps, to attach to the horizontal part of the seats, work very poorly. They attach both a elastic strap as well as a strap with a hook. There isn't enough unobstructed space under my seats for the elastic strap and there is no where to attach the hook. So, it often rides up, leaving a good chunk of the seat uncovered. I haven't figured out a workaround for that yet.I bought this one, in particular, because it had holes for the seat belt clips to come through. In case it was needed, I was going to buy a seat belt harness for the dog. I should state that I bought the cover not simply to keep dirt and hair off of the seat but also to keep the dog from destroying my car. He had, on a couple of occasions, nibbled on my seat belt and looking hungryly at the seats themselves. On the first day, he grabbed the cover near the seat belt hole and tore a 5 inch section of the seat cover. Where the seat belts come through is a weakness in the cover. I think this is the only place that it could be torn. I guess he was just lucky to choose that place. I do plan to tape them up."
38201,1,"I am the owner of 1 large cat. In the past, I would change his litter once a week, and all was well. As he got older, he decided that once a week wasn't going to work, and the floor was a better alternative then a slightly dirty litter box. So I started scooping the litter box every day. If your anything like me, this is possibly the most horrible and disgusting process one can participate in. After doing much research on self-cleaning litter boxes, I came across the Omega Paw RA20 Self-Cleaning Litter Box. All the positive reviews are correct. The box works great, and makes cleaning the litter box a snap. I'm happy, the cat is happy, and all is well again. Quite possibly, the best purchase I have ever made. Please note, this box is considerably larger then most cat boxes, and therefore requires a larger space, but the smaller version is way too small for most adult cats."
104514,2,"Construction & materials are good, it expands to very large size, but design is poor. You would have to have the straps tight enough to strangle Precious to keep him in this should he bolt to keep him from getting out of it. Thought I was getting a regular (dog like design) harness, one with both a shoulder and belly straps that connect to the neck and girth pieces, thus making it less flexible and harder for kitty to escape. Sending this one back, I am not willing to risk loosing our cat. Single ""H"" design not good, double ""H"" much better.The PetSmart's Grreat Choice Adjustable Cat & Kitten Harnesses and the The Premier Pet Come with me Kitty Harness offer a more secure design. Both have the double ""H"" design like in a regular dog harness.We currently have the PetSmart harness which works well & has a 16"" girth max, but I was search for a slightly larger harness for our indoor 16 pound cat who has an aversion to dieting. Looks like the Premier Pet Come with me Kitty Harness would be a better choice to keep our really fat cat secure when on leash."

Not sure if its because I do not have a large flea issue or its not working.. I plan on continuing to use it until I am 100% certain."

141015,0,"I've been using this box for about 4 years now, and it worked really well for me when I first got it. I liked it so much I eventually bought 3 more to have extras. I used to keep it right beside the back door and when it was time for cleaning I was able to just drag it right out the door and put it in a wagon to roll it around the yard. But now I have to keep two of them in different places further inside the house, and it is really a pain to drag these boxes through the house to get them outside. They are too bulky and heavy for me to carry so I do have to just drag them. I really wish it didn't have the side compartments, I don't need them and they just add extra bulk. Besides that sometimes the cats will just pee in those side compartments! This box would be better if it was redesigned with portability in mind. Some handles might help and it shouldn't be too wide to get through a doorway with it. If you have the right place to use this box it is great but keep in mind it is going to take up a lot of space and it is not easy to move around."
14488,2,"I applied this product to all three of my dogs, which are all under 10 pounds, and it is not working. It has not quite been a month and they are still scratching with fleas. I will not purchase this product again. It is too expensive and does not work effectively!!!"

Had to return it because it didn';t fit my dog.I returned the harness back to Amazon and they credited me the full amount paid. THEYpaid for my postage. I will definitely order from them again. I gave it a 3 star only bcuse it's NOT tru to size.
1615,1,My dog loves this toy. He runs around the house with it but it's also durable enough that he hasn't been able to eat it. My dog still likes it without anything stuffed inside. Its good to use as a ball to because it has a weird bounce.

104990,2,"I bought this wheel, in spite of the reviews saying it's noisy, because the options for a Syrian hamster are limited. I needed a wheel of about 8"" (the 6 1/4"" wheel I had was too small and 12"" wheels like the Silent Spinner are too big for my hamster's cage) and I wanted a plastic one as wire-runged/mesh wheels can hurt hamsters' feet.But this wheel is just awful. First, it won't clip to my hamster's cage because the clip is too big for the 3/8"" wire spacing. I read elsewhere that it won't even fit on 1/2"" wire spacing, which is ridiculous given that smaller rodents can escape through larger-spaced bars. I'm therefore forced to use the stand, which moves around somewhat as my hamster runs.The larger problem, however, is that this wheel is almost unbelievably noisy. It's hard to describe how loud it is, but in the dark quiet of night it's something comparable to a freight train. I tried putting a hair tie between the wheel and the top of the stand/bar clip, but with little positive effect. Tonight I'm going to try another hair tie on top of the current one, zip-tying the stand to the bars, snapping off the useless bar clip to stop it banging against the cage bars, and putting tissue paper between the wheel and the axel. I'm giving the wheel 2 stars (rather than 1) because, from what I've read, this is likely to solve the noise problems. However, all of these rememdies are going to be irritating to remove and redo every week when I clean the cage and wheel, plus I don't feel I should have to extensively modify a product that I've paid for.In sum, this wheel is very poorly designed. If my home fixes don't work, I'll be forced to buy the Wodent Wheel. (Unfortunately, that wheel has its own issues that prevented me buying it in the first place: its enclosed nature means you can't see your pet as well and it's hard to clean, plus the wheel is only 7 3/4"".)"

47982,1,I purchased a kitten and had to transport him back to my home. This carrier is very pet and owner friendly. If you need to travel by plane it is approved by all airlines. It accepts a seat belt easily for car transport.My kitty loves the sherpa lining and often just hangs out in the carrier to rest or play. It is a good purchase.
2854,2,Not for a dog that chews...which is all of them. But especially aggressive chewers like my 10 month old terrier. Big chunks come off and get swallowed. That can't be good for them. Steer away from these.

I like that they are light enough for me to pick up easily but heavy enough to stay put. I ordered some as gifts ang their dogs loved them too.

214090,1,"I have two hatchling Mississippi Map turtles, they are still under 2"" in size. At first they were not super interested in the floating log and that was okay, so long as they had something to hold onto while they swam and needed a break.This floating log is given 4 stars because the finish seems to be wearing off. I don't think it has caused any problems with my tank, but I am curious to know if it was nibbled off but it doesn't look like that at all. Now, after a couple months, the ""kids"" love it. I have trained them to eat from my fingers and I make them ""exercise"" by climbing up and over the log. I also have found they use the interior of the log for sleeping which is kinda cute.This is great for 29 gallon or more tanks and turtles up to 2 inches I imagine, I won't throw this out when I get a bigger tank, it will remain until it cannot support their resting weight if they wanna chill. It seems rather sturdy as far as floating goes and is weighted on the bottom to keep it locked in one position. (So the turtles cannot flip it over and they can climb onto it without it rolling.) I would buy this again."
178611,0,"Currently my dog hates this brush and I can't use it much on her. It pulls her hair like an addition review mentioned on here. It does make here hair very nice when I can get her to let me brush one spot for long enough to get the naughts out (she is a toy poddle) I have know doubt that once I get her hair up to par that this will be a great brush, but if you haven't already been brushing your dogs hair everyday this may not be the brush for you."
82627,0,"Our puppy was allowed to get aquainted with the new crate before spending any time alone inside. After spending only an hour or two at a time to get adjusted to the idea of being alone she managed to bend the wires on the walls, not the gates. The gates are strong and thick, very well made. Our little puppy managed to locate the weak points and pulled the wires inward from the top and bottom of the walls. Not only do I not want to endanger my puppy further but also it is of no use to anyone else."

33056,0,"It's a nice item, for an adult dog that is a lesst 15 pounds. I am a breeder and I bought this for my female dogs to use with their puppies once they start moving around and need more space to play and potty etc. However, for some reason - I can't figure out -it doesn't set level to the ground. Every other section is elevated about 2-3 inches and leaves a gap so the puppies & one of my smaller adult females can easily escape right through these spaces. I'm really disapointed with that. Also it didn't come with any instructions or any papers at all. The playpen itself is a no brainer - you just lift it out of the box and shape it into a square or a hexagon, it's already together, but if you order a top or a bottom you have to figure out wich way to face it and how to attach it. It's not terribly hard, you just might have to try it one way and it's not the right way, flip the whole thing over and try again. It's just simply annoying. I may not be keeping it, because I don't see a way for it to fulfill it's purpose here. If you are looking for a place to keep a medium size dog and up in around the house for a while so it has some room to move around, or you need to house them outside for camping or something like that then I would think it's a great product. It is well made, just smaller dogs can get through the bottom and I think they should tell you that it isn't level before you buy it!"
122410,2,"The vittles vault, although it looked like a definite winner, was not airtight. Not sure if this was an issue for everyone, but with my vault if you squeeze on the side a bit it will expel and bring back in air. After further inspection, the sides of my vittles vault will not clamp all the way down. Even if forced to do so, the clips just pop back off. For this reason I am giving it a 2 star rating, as it is not much more than an expensive rubbermaid tote at this point. Really wanted to like this, but I can't with this kind of QC.Update: 9/12/12The clips on the container are starting to break off at the seam of the clip. This container has been carefully opened only about 10 times...... Very poor product. Will avoid this brand in future purchases"

I was pleased with how cheap it is. That helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out. But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator. I am now using World's Best, which is more expensive, but worrth it. Buy it from Amazon or PetfoodDirect."
154349,0,"We had used a LitterMaid LM900 for our bengal kitty and it worked like a charm until we brought a second cat into our home. The LitterMaid started to stall during the rake cycle, and it seemed the motor was on its way out (just months after the warranty period, of course). After fighting a roundworm infection in our new kitten, we decided it was best to chuck it and get rid of any lingering possibility of roundworm eggs lurking in the litter box.So, after lots of research, we bought the Scoop Free thinking this would be a better solution. All seemed good, until we put it into use.The benefits:(1) The Scoop Free is cleaner than the LitterMaid - the crystal litter doesn't seem to get tracked around our home as much as the premium clumping litter we were using for the LitterMaid.(2) I like that you empty the entire bottom of the litter pan with each tray change. We live in an apartment, and there is no place to hose down a litter box, so the disposable tray was ideal for us. We were even comfortable with the cost of the replacement trays, if it would guarantee a clean-smelling home.Two major problems:(1) The odor from the waste under the hood is disgusting, even after just a few days of waste accumulation. Our cats are average to small sized (10lb Bengal and 5lb Burmese), so I don't think there is anything unusual as far as volumes here.(2) Our bengal cat is EXTREMELY afraid of the box, the litter.. in fact, everything about the Scoop Free. She refuses to use it after 2 months of trying with a regular litterbox right next to it, and has had two ""accidents"" as a result. Now we live in constant fear..... terrible!In summary, we will be going back to the LitterMaid even though it has some scathing reviews re: the new model. I would love to try the Litter Robot, but I am afraid our skittish Bengal will reject it, too."

I didn't want our other cat to bother her because she was scared all the time. Anyway, it did not work. It did nothing.

A crate is not meant to be a cage for a dog. It is, however, meant to confine your dog for a short amount of time as you train him or her to understand boundaries (including when and where not to eliminate). The mesh door on the front is like tissue paper for an energetic puppy, and the small ""windows"" aren't enough, for my rather social dog, to let her know I'm there yet not _right_ there. My more cage-like crate that is cumbersome and hard to carry is far more effective.But this is really well made, and when we need to take our dog for a ride for a while this is a nice option. We usually leave it on one end of the backseat with a big dog bed in it (it's really quite large) and the flap open but down. She can get up and sit on the seat and look out the window, or crawl in and take a nap. And it all folds down and clips together for a very portable profile."

It took so long I went ahead and purchased the small one so I would have something for my puppy but she is growing fast and this will soon be too small. The large still shows not shipped yet. What up?

128846,1,"I purchased this last year for my niece's dogs during Christmas and had it sent to me instead of her home. When I opened the box, my dogs went crazy over it. I couldn't send to my niece at that point I wanted to keep them, they played with these all year, although the toys have held up they were looking pretty worn, so I ordered a new set and now they are playing with the old ones and the new ones. I have to say I have very few toys that hold up for an entire year but these seem to be very rugged. My dogs rate this a 5."
138712,0,"I got this brush for my two guinea pigs. As the last reviewer said, it does not catch all of the loose hair/fur. The whole reason that I purchased this was so that it would grab all of my piggies' loose fur so that they would shed less. It did not accomplish the job. I think that the bristles are just too far apart to do the job. The product itself is free of defects and seems to be of decent quality materials."
107155,2,"As someone who rescues rabbits, I can tell you this is a terrible environment for your rabbit. Your rabbit needs much more space. It is easier and cheaper to get an excersize pen and litterbox train your rabbit. No need for expensive bedding, which can cause resperatory problems in rabbits. If you rescue a rabbit, they are litterbox trained already and spayed/neutered (ALWAYS SPAY OR NUETER YOUR RABBIT. Doing so can extend its lifespan from 4-5 years to 8-11 years and cut down on aggression and other unwanted behaviors). You shouldn't give them this food either. They need unlimited timothy hay, timothy hay pellets every day (about a 1/4 cup for a 5 pound rabbit), and a mix of fresh greens daily. That's it. Check out a book called The House Rabbit Handbook by Harriman. This should be your ultimate resource. Don't buy into vitamin drops and other items. You don't need them if they are getting the greens and hay they need. And PLEASE, DO NOT BUY A RABBIT FOR EASTER. Most rabbits purchased for Easter are abandoned or ignored. About 80% die due to neglect. Remember rabbits are animals that will live 8-11 years and are a real responsibility. Please adopt. There are so many unwanted rabbits out there.House Rabbit Handbook: How To Live With An Urban Rabbit"

77187,0,"I got this pen for my boxer puppy, thinking it would help contain her during the day while I'm at work, but giving her more room than a crate. She learned to climb over it the second day (10 weeks old). The pen itself is very easy to put together and is pretty solid and heavy enough so she can't lift it. I would recommend this for smaller dogs, but not large breeds, unless there is a secure cover to contain the dog, but I have yet to find one."
91659,0,"This bed is probably best for breeds 75 lbs or less. I have a 110-115lb greater swiss mountain dog. She has been laying on this bed for 2 weeks now (some during the day and sleeps on it at night). First of all the bed fabric is already stretched enough that she sinks down in the bed. I am hoping it does not stretch too much more but for only 2 weeks I am afraid this fabric will not last more than 3 months. Luckily the fabric can be replaced and is not expensive so I guess it is not so bad. The other problem is the one side keeps coming loose. The side and two legs are attached to the cross bars by a single screw (2 screws total for each side). The two screws on the one side of the bed keep coming loose. In the two weeks she has been using the bed I have had to tighten them two times. Luckily I know when they need to be tightened because all the sudden she will stop using the bed. I guess she can feel that it is not right. I believe the fabric and the frame is just not made for a dog this heavy. I will say that my dog is very gentle with the bed. She is a bit of a scaredy cat and very gingerly gets on and off it. It actually took some time to get her to stay on the bed because she was afraid of it at first. When she would get off the bed it would tip a bit and it made her really nervous. So, if you have a extra large dog that is not as gentle I cannot imagine it would last very long without having to be tightened and the fabric replaced. The last thing is my dog does not like the fabric. It is rough and until I put a blanket on it she would not touch it.In all I think the bed design is good if you have a lighter dog. The fabric is a bit rough but I would rather have rough fabric that can be easily cleaned. It is not a big deal to throw a blanket, crate bed or towel on top of it. I like having the bed raised up so much better then the dog beds laying on the ground. I find it so much easier to clean."

127383,2,"This is a review of the Kyjen Hide-a-Bird Puzzle Plush Interactive Dog Toy, Large.It is a plush 6"" cube made to look like a birdhouse. It has a 3"" hole in the front and another 3"" hole in the left side. Included are 3 small stuffed plush birds with plastic squeakers.My dog is a 2 yo 50 lb Lab guide dog.I introduced the toy to her as recommended in the instructions.She then placed one paw into one opening and held the birdhouse in place while she stuck her snout into the other opening and pulled the 3 birds out in approximately 5 seconds. We repeated the process, got the same results, and this time she almost extracted the squeaker from one of the birds in the 15 seconds before I took it away from her.My rating is based on the accuracy of the ""Product Features"" as listed in this product page on Amazon.-Eliminates boredom (1 star: Eliminated boredom for 5 seconds).-Develop a dog's intelligence (1 star: My dog does not appear to be more intelligent after our interaction with this toy).-Fun puzzle solving skills (1 star: Insert paw, insert snout, remove birds. Is that a puzzle?)-Keeps pet occupied (1 star: Kept pet occupied for 5 seconds. Add 3x 15 seconds if dog is allowed to shred the birds)."
156411,0,"First, when I opened the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, I found large ink letters (not matching anything on the packaging) that seemed to have rubbed off onto the toy surface. The letters were backwards so it clearly wasn't intended to be printed on the toy. I wasn't able to completely remove the ink, although most of it came off with an alcohol scrub. Other than that, the quality seemed fine.However, the hole to let food out is pretty wide ( >1 in.) so some of the kibble falls out right away. Unfortunately, that hole is the only access point (the ball can't be opened like similar balls/wobbly toys I've seen) so several stray pieces of kibble always get stuck in the internal cavity. I've used this twice and both times after the dog removed everything she could, I had to shake the ball for over 5 minutes to get the last few pieces out. Basically, the kibble either falls out too easily or gets caught inside.Definitely not worth the hassle -- buy one that can be opened for filling/emptying/cleaning."
137131,2,The legs do not attach as the instructions state. It was a waste of my money. I would not purchase again
10104,2,The hampsters were loving the cage and wheel. Then I heard the hampster squeaking and entered to find that her leg had gotten caught in the small opening on the wheel. She was stuck. I helped get her leg out and it appears that she has a slight cut and is limping a bit on her back leg. I immediately put tape over the opening so this won't happen again and may need to remove wheel all together.
166283,1,"I was really happy with these covers. They work great on my dog food cans. I haven't tried them yet on my canned foods, but I'd imagine they will work great for that as well. They actually sealed the dog food can so well that I dropped one upside down while taking it out of the fridge and the cover still stayed on. I think it's a worthwhile purchase if you plan on feeding your dogs wet food because it helps keep it fresh if you don't plan on using the whole can in one sitting."
158012,0,"I have a large icrate with a divider panel. I do love this crate, however the hooks and edges are very sharp. Today I took the divider panel out so I could collapse the crate to give to friend who is watching my puppy while I'm out of town. I leaned the panel against the bedroom door and my puppy came up to investigate. As she backed up, a hook went COMPLETELY THROUGH HER EYELID. After a couple seconds of her screaming in pain I managed to get her calm enough to carefully slide the hook back out and rush her to the vet. Fortunately the hook did not injure her eye but she has a bloody gash in her eyelid and it's very swollen. She's going to have to be on antibiotics for the next week. Vet visit cost $120, half of which was for the emergency status of the visit and the other half for the antibiotics. The hooks need to be rounded off or filed down."

9960,2,My son thought this cage would be fun for his hamster. It turned out to be very smelly and noisy. I wouldn't recommend this product. When the hamster uses the wheel (all night long) it makes so much noise we have to move the cage out of my son's room at night so he can sleep. Very hard to clean all the parts that get messy. Because of all the hard surface parts that the hamster can go to the bathroom in and on it gets very smelly within a day or two of cleaning it. This doesn't make it a very good environment for the hamster to live in or to keep in a bedroom where my son would like to keep his hamster. We are searching for a better cage so I wasted a lot of money on this one.

152074,2,"HiI was first shipped litter containers, and not the indicated item.The shipper then sent the Cabana, but, it was missing 6 keys. These keys allow youto connect the different tubes to construct the tent. Without the connector keys,the items included, the tent and tubes, are useless. Since some of the keys connect 3 tubes, oneat right angle to the other two, there is little you can do to replace the missing items.I can't be of much help, since I never got the item up and working."
168266,0,"Because these collars are round, they're reflective from every angle, which is great. And when I say ""reflective"", I mean reallyREALLY reflective, which is also great. The reflective tape is woven through the whole collar, and there's lots of it, so it really picks up the light when I'm out walking my dogs at night.I would've given them a perfect rating, except for the fact that the collars are a lot bigger than they're supposed to be. The size is stated as 19""-24"", but even when it's buckled at the tightest notch, the collar is still a little over 27"", which is so big that they can slide easily over the heads of my two 75-lb Golden Retrievers. So it's a great collar for night-safety purposes, but really bad for dog-restraint purposes.The collars so inexpensive that it didn't seem worth the trouble to return them, so when I take the dogs out at night, I just slip the reflective collars on along with their regular collars, kind of like a necklace rather than a dog collar, which actually works pretty well. So overall, I'd recommend the collars pretty highly - just order a size a lot smaller than you think you'll need, or plan to use it mainly as a decorative accessory."
48105,0,The cats love these little fur balls but they do fall apart pretty easily so it's good they come in a 24 pack. 3 stars only because one of them got wet and stained my floor and I'm having trouble getting it out. I'll probably keep getting them though because my cats go crazy over them.
15848,2,"This is the 2nd time I have purchased this brand/model collar.Pro's: Audible tone can be used prior to the shock stimulation.Con's: Range was not reliable. If the transmitter/receiver are not in a direct line, there is not connection, resulting in no tone or shock. I was too confident in this product when I initially purchased the first collar, realized very quickly that it was not what it was talked up to be. My dog likes to chase and herd other dogs/cats/rabbits/deer/etc. Even on his initial take off, I could not get the collar to work. I kept pressing the buttons and he finally got the tone/shock while he was on his way back (no I wasn't pressing both buttons, the shock 'misfired' while the tone button was pressed). Fed up with the product I returned it to the store, and after several attempts with them trying to convince me to try another one, maybe this one was defective, they finally returned my money.After another close call, I opted to try a collar again, and once again this one came highly recommended, and I believed that there may have been something wrong with the first collar I purchased. Much to my dismay, the same issues that I experienced with the first collar were present. I wised up this time and decided to try it around the house with the tone only before I let him outside again. I could not get this to work while he was 2 FEET AWAY! I believe this one was actually WORSE than the first one.As far as I can tell, this is a piece of junk! Customer Service was nice and tried to help me with the issue, but none of the trouble shooting helped. This product is not worth your time or effort, and its DEFIANTLY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."

126163,1,"I love my Littermaid Litterbox! On the whole, it makes my life a lot easier. Not only am I married with a three year old, but I have two cats, and trying to keep up with a regular cat box was not exactly easy. Now, with the Littermaid, I only have to think about the cat box once a week! Yes, the receptacles are expensive, but it is easy to re-use the ones that I have. The tent is not necessary to use the box. I now have the tent because it does make the box less obvious, but I did not have it when I first bought the Littermaid, and I never had any problems. As for the ""Fill Line"", it is in bold black print, and very easy to see. I have gone over the limit before, and the Littermaid has still always worked just fine. The box is pretty loud, but the noise only lasts for a few seconds and it helps if you can put it somewhere out of the way. I live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, and it doesn't bother us at all. The pros out-weigh the cons by far on this item. Definitely a time saver for cat owners!"

It really cuts down on my cat's bad behavior & spraying, and eliminates it when the diffuser is working properly. The last two months the diffuser has stopped working. It still feels warm to the touch, but it dries out the pheromone ""wick"" and the liquid does not dissipate. My cat's bad behavior has increased as a result.

Also, the toy is very small... smaller than an average person's palm... the make doesnt look too good either... i like the color and the texture but thats it.

Your cat won't either. It's bad enough when you try to change the cat's litterbox. But you're asking for trouble putting this poorly designed contraption on it. What's even worse it trying to wrestle with removing and reinstalling it should you need to do anything to the box. It's bad enough the top half of the ""Mega Elite"" doesn't firmly attach to the base. But the little poles on this cover tend to get stuck in their mounting holes and pull up the base when you try to remove the cover. So then you're faced with the hassle of putting the top back into place before you can reinstall the cover.Basically it seems like a good idea but in practical it's a huge pain in the, well... just avoid it."
50008,1,"if your growing plants. then one of these is very handy. i ordered 5. and according to professional growers. ph test kits such as these are very suggested because they are very accurated. although expensive ph meter/ or test pens are also good, they are expensive around 80 and you can use it for a certain amount of times then you have to calibrate it again to increase the potency in accuracy. I avoid doing that because a good digital ph is like 80+ and plus the calibration to calibrate it back to default is extra. so i purchased 5 of these to get free shipping and got it. and each pack works for 250 times or 250 tests. so this is definitely a good deal to get. before you order make sure you find out the ph level you need to achieve for either your plants or fish tanks. instructions seems tricky at first but look at the same card. fill water till line. 3 drops. shake it up. and match colors. &lt;4 simple rules. make sure to follow it. and this only tests from ph 6.0 to 7.6 so if you need a different ph number than those then check out some other products. cause this only one does 6.0 - 7.6."

After one week, it was physically obvious that she needed the Corta-Flx to keep her joints in good working order. I have never taken her off of it again.

178012,0,"I took a chance despite the negative reviews from people who received damaged igloos because of the shoddy shipping. Sure enough, mine came wrapped in plastic, no box. The UPS man punched a hole in the plastic to put his hand through and carry it to my door. It got banged around or warped by the heat enough during shipping that the top part had popped itself out of the front latches -- two nipples and a flat part which is supposed to be pushed through a slot but it is such hard plastic, you cannot bend it enough to get it into the slot. I banged on it for awhile with a hammer and a screwdriver, trying to force the latch in, but the warp in the top igloo was strong enough to keep popping it out. Finally, after forcing it again, I quickly put several layers of duct tape over it and put it outside, so I guess I'll just hope for the best. It does have a strong odor at first, and I am hoping that goes away as the weather gets to it outside. I've only had it a day, so I can't report on how it holds up in rain, snow, heat and cold yet. The cats have gone in and out of it, but so far I haven't noticed one sleeping inside yet, but it's only the first day.I think the lack of an escape door in the back might be an issue.There are three tom cats who come around my house and peer in my windows, but if I go outside to invite them in, they run off. So I just have to leave food outside for them. I feel sad when it's raining and they're staring in the window and won't come in, so I hope this helps. They're usually not all here on on the same nights. Hope I don't get a possum! I have had one of them on my porch, too.I have looked everywhere and can't find a dog house any cheaper than this -- and apparently I didn't pay as much as some of the people who posted reviews from several years ago, so I hope it works just enough. (Since I originally wrote this review, the price of the item has doubled!)Months later: The summer passed and my cats who are allowed in the backyard have taken turns sleeping inside this. So far it is still in one piece. I noticed when it rains hard and water gets inside it, the carpet takes a long time to dry after, so I put old towels inside it now that I can replace. I can't get over how expensive it got. I must have hit a sale when I bought mine."

The old gal uses it only because it's in her customary place, but I don't see where she's any cooler. I would imagine she gets some relief from pressure through the waterbed effect, although the intent was to make her cooler in the heat. Other bed is pretty much avoided by most of the dogs even though it's in a 'usual' bedding place. I did cover them with lightweight sheets to keep them clean - maybe that's the difference?? Don't know, but I'll likely be sending the third back, unopened. Have used the ones that remain damp in the past - they hated those so I though maybe this would work.

After eyeing it at the local store for well over year, I couldn't wait to stop having to clean the cat box quite so much...Little did I know that I would actually spend MORE time up to eyeballs in dirty cat litter trying to get this thing to work.We have a single 8-lbs cat named Wilma. We own the MEGA model of the littermaid. Should be good, right?Wrong. Dead wrong. It jammed for the first time about 5 days after we set it up.This thing is poorly designed. What you have to understand is that the rake mechanism that sweeps up the clumps of litter runs along a line of sprocket-like plastic ridges...ridges that get jammed with litter every time it operates.Once the ridges get jammed (for us it's about once a week) - the littermaid just stops working and you get to chisel out the dirty litter that clogged it with a screwdriver/tothpick/whatever. Oh boy is that fun.I assure you that cleaning these things is far more time intensive than cleaning a normal, plain-jane box.In closing, I don't recommend this product at all. Save yourself a good chunk of money and avoid digging litter out from under your fingernails on a regular basis."
46869,1,"I have two male rats in this cage and they love it. I have space for a medium sized igloo, hammock, exercise wheel and large food bowl. My two boys have space and seem to enjoy the cage. I would recommend this cage for people with one of two rats. I don't think more than two male rats would fit comfortably though."

193395,0,"the sweater is very cute but the leg holes are way too small and for the price of shipping it back and exchanging it I could buy another sweater. I was very unhappy with the shipping charges on exchanges, I just cut the leg holes bigger and sewed them myself."
91683,0,my dogs love this and can not rip/tear it up like the other beds. plus it does not stink like the traditional beds. buying another one for my other dog..
107429,0,"I agree with above reviewer. My guys have had this toy for over a year. The head was the first to go in very short order. I revamped the resewed the head and they are still playing tug of war with it. The legs have lasted. I have purchased other toys from this manufacturer, they grade according to tuffness. The others I have purchased have been graded 9 and 10(the tuffest) and they are lasting my two chew crazy Boston Terriers far longer than any toy except Kongs. I would recommend"
82264,1,"This doggie blanket coat is absolutely adorable. But, I needed an XL for my 35 lb. dachshund/lab mix. So keep that in mind. The quality and value are truly superb and I'm thrilled with it. I find that size is a big issue with dog apparel and have learned to err on the side of caution by ordering larger. I'm thrilled to know my ""baby"" will be snug and warm this winter!"
151820,2,I have a 2 year old pit bull labrador mix and it took him all but ten minutes to destroy this toy. This has been the most short lived toys we've bought for the dog.
97972,1,"I bought this bed for my wheaten terrier who is just under 30"" from head to tail and 36 lbs. The large-sized bed has more than enough room to allow him to sleep completely stretched out. It even fits in his crate! He loves the high sides on the bed because he feels protected from all sides and can use them as a pillow. The bed is super cushy and takes a while for it to lose its puffiness which is great! To re-inflate, just wash and dry - it doesn't fit in my washing machine, but I just take it down to the laundromat and use the extra large washer/dryer. We love it so much we're going to get a second one for the bedroom so that he has a place to sleep other than in my bed!"
142362,2,"Cheaply made, with tons of small parts that get caked in gooey cat litter. When using the recommended cat litter, the rake becomes clogged almost instantly with wet clay, turning it into a shovel that can dump the entire box full of litter at once, with most of it ending up on the floor. If the litter level gets slightly below the fill line, then urine &amp; clay form a hard flat brick on the bottom that the rake just skips right over &amp; has to be scraped off. Everything about cleaning this unit causes you to have to get cat waste all over yourself. It's also very loud when it self cleans, if you can call what it does cleaning. I just can't imagine what Littermaid was thinking when it decided to sell this horrifying mess of a product. By the way, after one week of putting up with constantly trying to tend to this thing and clean up after it, I have pulled the plug on the littermaid &amp; gone back to my old simple cat box. What a luxury it is to have a cat box again that is so much simpler and easier to use! These units make you really appreciate how easy a plain old cat box really is. Also- I should point out that I also bought the tent that goes with it, which collapsed the first time my cat jumped up on it. I took it apart and discovered one of the cheap plastic corner supports had snapped &amp; this was new, out of the box. It's currently held together with duct tape. What a piece of junk!"
206486,0,"Purchased this cage almost 2 weeks ago but only just had time to assemble and try it out a few days back...What I've discovered is that this cage seemed like it would do the job well for two bunnies, however the downside is if you have a lack of space and/or if your bunny(ies) are not yet litter-trained. I honestly didn't mind so much having to train my newer, younger bun-bun, but this cage definitely does not seem to make cleaning it a breeze despite what is described =/ Each 'platform' has a crack bordering the edge where bunny food (pellets) and 'coco puff' wastes can end up and you have to go to each platform to get all the junk out from the cracks. If you don't get to the litter quick enough,it easily gets kicked off to your home floor as the bunnies run around. I absolutely DREADED having to come home to clean the many amounts of litter on my hardwood floor; even just the thought of it made me twitch >.&lt;Planning to return the unit within the week, but in the meantime, keeping them in their first, one-level cage that I'm more than content with :)...which unfortunately is more than I can say for my bunnies, but I make sure to let them out to run around the house still at the least, so I hope that makes up for it ^w^Overall, I have to give it 3 stars as an ""OK"" product because I believe it could truly be a great cage to have for those who don't mind the possible mess that may come with having this cage. But for someone like me whose level of OCD for neat & cleanliness is pretty high, it was truly unbearable -_-; Positive note: At least it's always returnable within a certain time-frame, less shipping cost :PP.S. Make sure you measure where you plan to put the cage! It's bigger than what one might expect XP"
42767,0,"The ingredients look good and I'm sure that this is a healthy formula. But after a week, my dog's stomach is still not tolerating it well. I've been doing a 50/50 mix with her previous food to transistion. I'm hoping that she'll grow into it because this looks like a good formula,"
95845,2,"Great price! but that about the only positives I can think of. problem is that the wire bends and makes it really difficult to pick up my dog's deuces. I have a Great Dane, he takes massive dumps, should be as hard as it is. I'm about to buy another and throw this one out."
215383,0,"Works better than most remedies we tried. We still needed to use ""peroxide/baking soda/dish soap"" remedy in conjunction with this product. Even at that there was still a bit of lingering odor especially when the dog gets damp. Bottom line is it makes the situation a lot more tolerable."
109455,2,"Somewhere I got it in my head that KONG was the manufacturer of good dog products. Boy was I mistaken or mislead. And unfortunately I wasted a bunch of money on squeaky balls. The first thing to go was the squeaker. Well okay, I thought, that's only part of the fun, so I wasn't upset. But then my poodle chewed the cover off the ball and ripped it apart in no time flat.What the heck?This is supposed to be a CHEW-toy. If an 8 month old poodle pup can't chew it for longer than a week, then its a pretty junky product. (He mostly chases balls and does his chewing on Bully Sticks.)Now to the dangerous part. It was so easy for my pup, who is a large miniature, to destroy the ball that I can't recommend them at-all. In fact, we are now waiting to see what happens and if a visit to the vet is in our future, because bits and pieces are missing and we're hoping that Pippin didn't swallow them.Not worth the money or the worry.Pam T~"
50612,1,"I have 3 dogs, a boxer (11 yrs), a pug (4 yrs) and a english bulldog (4 mo) This treat is a wonderful product for training the bulldog. The boxer and the pug really enjoy eating it also. I recommend this product for your animal."
206119,2,"The crate looked like a good deal and when I opened it, indeed it looked well constructed, but oi! the smell of plastic was too strong for my nose and I couldn't imagine subjecting my dog to it either. I opened it up and tried to set the bars to keep it open, but there was no way I was strong enough to make the bars that stabilize it to keep it open, fit together. I carry forty pound bags of dog food frequently so am no 90# weakling, but this crate buffaloed me."
26490,2,"While this product offers an astounding quantity of catnip at an unbeatable price, buyers should be aware that this toy is so incredibly heavy that most cats will be physically unable to play with it. I don't know if my cats are unusually weak or what, but even when they work together they're unable to push the sack more than a few inches at a time. The low sale price is also offset by the cost of shipping such a massive brick of catnip across the country. Cat fanciers would probably be better served by more traditional cat toys, like a nice clothbound copy of The Infinite Jest that their kitties can bat around."
144997,1,But our dog seemed to get used to the taste. It's more effective when it hasn't been used for a while.
122353,0,"I bought this feeder and it does a fair job of keeping squires out. They still get on it but they get little feed. It has descent weather protection for the seed but it swings a lot in the wind. Over all a good feeder for the price. Also, Squires make jambalaya and that reduces the potential for raiders!!!"
100269,0,Really cute but I can't get it to stay on our lab even though the size seems right. The head part with the ears keeps falling behind her ears. Adorable but I don't think it will stay on right for more than a quick photo.
144981,0,"We thought that we had finally found the holy grail! Our bored Standard (since our daughter went to college) has a licking problem and his saliva turns his white fur brown. We have tried more exercise, a couple of different sprays and a few home recipes all to no avail. The day this came and we first applied it, Harry took one sniff, a short lick and immediately turned away from the area YEAHHHH! It only took him about 1 week to get used to the smell and taste and now he has learned to tolerate it. Back to the drawing board for us :-(....."
90491,0,"We got a pair of XXSM for our miniature pinscher and they were way too big. They looked like they would fit a cocker spaniel or border collie sized dog. I think these would be a good product, but getting the right size is going to be the problem for most people ordering these online."
104976,2,"Super loud, The dynamics of it are so odd creating a bouncing effect that create even more noise. other than that an okay wheel i guess."
10793,1,"I have two dogs that love to chew, a dachshund and a pit mix. They love their stuffed toys. Most only last a day before they are torn to shreds. These kong stuffed toys have lasted over a month. Worth every penny!"
20095,0,"While I love the idea of using a renewable and natural product, particularly one that gets tossed every few days, the odor with this product is almost as bad as the odor it's supposed to suppress. My three cats wouldn't go near it. Perhaps the aroma wears off soon enough, just not soon enough for me. In addition, the pellets are quite large, not the fine, sand-like quality my cats are used to. I'm sure it works well for some felines, just not mine."
48336,0,"Petsafe Has quite a racket going on, making their own special batteries. I have found the charge in these batteries to be inconsistent, with some batteries lasting months, and some lasting weeks.There are generic versions of these batteries for sale, which are significantly cheaper. I've ordered some of the cheaper batteries, but haven't used them yet as I'm still using the last of these Petsafe brand batteries. Hopefully the cheaper ones work as well or better."
155466,0,"This was pretty easy to put together and looks very nice (much nicer than a litter box out in the open, that's for sure) -- but I've found that the door does not stay latched. When one of my cats comes out of the box, if he/she doesn't jump through the opening perfectly without bumping the top or sides, the door flies open (and stays open). I wish there were a better latch; I think I'll need to try to install a magnet or use a small piece of duct tape to keep my cats from pushing the door open as they exit the box. Otherwise, good product."
169138,2,This item is kinda cheap.It is hard to get on a window sill.you'll need a deep window sill for this to work.
143418,2,"The zipper on this product has itty-bitty teeth. The zipper actucally seperated during intial set up.Also, the vertical tubes are too long to allow the ten to fit over the frame of tubes.It does keep the litter dust in but you have to modify the kit right out of the box."
153151,0,"Setup was fairly straightforward; the many conditions required for this product were either adequately or perfectly fulfilled by my laundry room. Product works upwards of 90% of the time. The other 1-9% are a nightmare. This is NOT something you can leave alone for months and years in the manner the company would have you believe. Problems I have:1. Unit clogs regularly, though infrequently. Every month you'll find the tub filled with feces- and urine-water and the unit beeping angrily. You need gloves, a face mask to mitigate the stench, some protective eyewear so you you don't get contaminated water. You'll need to take things apart, clear out wet cat poop and granules that inevitably get everywhere. You'll not be able to leave your house for long in fear that this will happen, leaving your cat without a litterbox.2. Speaking of granules getting everywhere, I bought this because my cat was trailing litter through his paws. This did not solve the problem. Granules litter my house.3. Calls to customer service were not answered or returned until I finally got through 45 minutes later.4. Interfacing with the unit is a mind-numbingly complicated set of beeps, arcane lights and instructions that only experts can decipher.5. Lastly, think of the time and money spent: this unit costs upwards of $300 including the unit, sanitizer, granules and accessories, as well as the added electricity, water and your time spent looking after it.I recommend this for two types of people:1. People who don't mind taking the time to master the system, maintain the machine regularly and get a very grungy sometimes, perhaps once a month.2. People who happen to have the perfect setup in their laundry room, who buy every accessory the company sells and sets the timer to wash all the time, floors their house with astroturf to get the granules off the cat's paws. If you don't create the ideal situation and something doesn't work, don't bother trying to call the company; it's your problem, not theirs.Everyone else should wait for a better mousetrap. This ain't it."
210531,0,"I thought it was gonna be great when I read the previous reviews. I got my original version during black Friday 2011. I had it for about a month and during that time it went from working will to having an issue with the conveyor motor. It made a funny noise that got progressively worse. I emailed customer service and after a week they sent me a new version; I thought the problem was solved. Instead, the motor is heating up with this version and the conveyor is making a funny noise. The litter guard doesn't stay where suppose too either. I've emailed customer service twice and haven't heard from them yet...The reason why I gave it 3 stars, is because my cat still uses the litter bowl and it's handy not having to clean the litter box. My issue with it has been the noise that the conveyor makes and waiting for customer service on this second go around. Maybe I just got two sucky units, but if I had the chance to decide on different auto litter box, I wouldn't have gotten this one."
21065,0,product works good if you have a mild wetting. i had to use adult pads inside the band and it worked great. overall though im pleased with the product.
212588,0,after openning contents and putting collars on the dogs we found out they did not work . all batteries were dead . had to buy all new batteries thru amazon .SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED .not happy .
2641,2,"This seller is not providing inaccurate information. The product they are selling is hinged longways down the middle. The product in the picture appears to have a door. There is also no ""lamp-clamp"" feature. It is also a little too big for standard 29 gallon size tanks."
107417,0,"We got this to replace a previous car seat purchase for her. On a difficulty scale of 1-10, I'd say installation is about a 4. It's made for a back seat, which is nice, a lot of dog car seats can only be installed in the front passenger seat. The straps that hold the dog are awkwardly placed and force the dog to sit or lie down, which bothers my dog. She rejected the sheepskin pad and prefers just the plastic. The storage bin is nice, but the legs aren't very stable unless you stuff something inside them to hold them erect.It's just okay for what it costs."
105138,2,The dimensions are correct but it is very thin. It is about the same thickness (padding) as a thin down comforter. This is more of a topper than a bed.
111114,0,"The kitten likes it (though being a kitten likes anything that moves), the big cat is interested only sometimes.On the plus side, the batteries last ages."
208879,2,"This product is of very poor quality. The foam began to come apart within a couple months of use. The cover is easy to remove for washing, but extremely difficult to put back on the poor quality foam. The bed now looks like it has been use for years versus months. It is not worth the money."
174066,1,"I got several of these on the advice of my veterinarian. My dog was digging holes to China, chewing on the decking, and generally destroying everything in the back yard and house. I soak some of her kibble in water overnight in the fridge, puree it all in the food processor, fill the kongs, and put them in the freezer. She gets one of these as a treat every afternoon, and works on it for at least an hour, trying to get the ""treat"" out of the inside. When her jaw gets tired, she gets tired. She takes all her destructive energies out on the Kong, and it's holding up great. I may even get my lawn back! :)"
18041,2,"We where hoping to use this instead of a shock collar but it had absolutely zero affect on our barking Jack Russel. She didn't even flinch, sneeze, or anything and we could see it spraying. We had to toss this and go with a ""static"" collar which is I guess the working used for shock collars now."
115160,0,"I had this product and it lasted about 24 months when the plastic tank developed a crack and leaked water on the floor. I liked it a lot and will buy another. The tank is rather heavy for an older person to lift, perhaps a one gallon would be better."
97058,2,I don't like this product because the food does not come down into the feeding bowl as it's used. It just stays up under the canister. My cat completely knocks the thing over so he can get his food out and then the food goes everywhere.
162759,2,"I thought it was nice at first, but my dog was able to remove it in only 2 days. Of course, he chewed it off and now it's gone."
148072,2,"This is a powerful toy! I barely had it unfurled before my bored and jaded cat lunged, and I got clawed trying to get it back....she LOVES it, madly. I don't recommend giving it to a child to use because it takes some thought and skill (and space) to manage it without destroying everything in sight. The package recommends putting it away when not in use, and that is excellent advice. I have to sneak around to hide it where she does not see me do that or she would probably level the place til she got it back. She is not that ambitious, so you can see how appealing it is! I hope she will not be harmed by the clip or other parts when she catches it. However, BEWARE. It split like wood at the far end (as a result of our first skirmish?) and gave me a very tiny but vicious splinter and heaven knows how it might harm the cat. This was not a two part pole, either, for what that's worth. The packing box was big enough for a baseball bat."
92514,0,"I had this charmer. My cat loved it. She would sit by the closet everynight waiting for me to play with her. The second I turned my back she ate a large portion of it without me knowing until she threw it up the next morning in one piece. The next time she got a hold of this toy without me knowing it until it was too late, she ate about 6 inches of it. It finally came out in her litter box about 3 days later in one piece. Only play with strict supervision."
90419,0,"My JRT was able to easily chew off bits and pieces of this toy (tail &#34;handle&#34;) so it didn't last long. It is heavy and hard to squeak, but she was able to squeak it and enjoyed it, but not for long. Once she set to chewing and got pieces of plastic off, I had to remove the toy. Probably better suited to a dog that fetches rather than destroys."
77729,1,"First, I'm totally impressed that Amazon has this ""under review."" I received the crate and it was bent on the side (it wasn't properly packaged. I called and it looks like they listened & are doing something about it! The crate was in the original manufacturer's carton, was shipped to Amazon & then shipped to me and by that time the packaging jus wasn't sufficient.) So, I had them reship it to get one in better shape (the returns process was very easy) and that one was even more bent. I see what others were saying about the misalignment of the door - it must have been from shipping as that's what happened here too. I then asked them to send a THIRD one and this last one was PERFECT. Of course, it was a bit of a pain to take down the old ones, get them back into the box and bring them over to The UPS Store for the return. Before purchasing the crate on Amazon, I had purchased a different one (different manfacturer too) from Petsmart & that quality (stronger bars) was much better but it was also twice as expensive (and too small, I realized, which is why I needed a new one.) So, the Amazon one was a good value and, all in all, I'd purchase it again. I might go for a higher end line of the Midwest Crates though if I needed a new one. My puppy is ok in it but a stronger, bigger dog might not be. Also, the Midwest Crate came with a free video on how to crate train which was cute/effective."
28742,0,"This was the best battery-powered air pump I could find and it works well for traveling, which is why I bought it. But it is very loud and moves almost violently. For some reason the one I have will only work with the battery power. The electric cord just won't work. Again, I'll stress how loud it is. I would only recommend it because of the price and it works for traveling in a car if you wrap it in towels to smother the noise."
19456,2,I have no idea if my cats would enjoy this. I never received a unit that worked. Gave up after the second one arrived DOA.
14413,0,I saw nothing special about this item. I feel if it had a hinge that opened with a latch instead of a screw it would be much better. For the price you can find one at Walmart. My previous one I purchased locally and it is much better product.
74838,1,"Water Dog is a great concept and aids us in making sure our dogs have fresh water on demand, although the motion sensor could be improved because it shuts the water off even while the dogs are drinking and tends to click back on when the dogs start to walk away (maybe a sensitivity dial could be helpful)."

82788,0,"I get that they recommend a bigger product so that your dog is not kept in too small of a crate but this crate is pretty big for a lab. It dominates our living room, which is where we wanted it."

17347,0,"The spray collar worked on my small terrier dog but she didn't like the heavyness of it around her neck. It did not work on my other dog, a pomeranian, she just ignored it and kept on barking. The spray ran out faster than I thought. If I had the collar turned on and my dog had her head out the car window, a motorcycle going buy would set it off on her.I would say that the collar halped diminish barking a little, but when the dog really wants feels threatened or has a strong urge to bark a lot, they just ignore the collar."
52388,2,"This sock is like another one I bought previously, in that it is of a very tough material that makes it difficult for the birds to extract the seeds. I have a companion sock that the finches prefer, and they usually leave this one alone. This is a heavy duty sock that makes the finches work for the seeds."
196522,2,"I bought this to replace a standard, single-flap doggy door. The large size of this product is listed as having a 10""x15"" opening, which is the same size as the one I was replacing. This doggy door was slightly larger and required I cut a larger opening in the wall.The reason I only gave this 2 stars is due to the flimsy black plastic. The black plastic portion is attached to the wall, while the white aluminum frame with flap is attached to the black plastic by 4 small screws. The plastic is so thin that the aluminum frame detached from the black plastic while I was installing it in the wall. The screws just pulled through, stripping the plastic. Without reinforcing these 4 screws, I'm guessing that my 2 large dogs running through this door would rip the frame and flap off in no time.I do like the double flap to keep the weather out. The magnets resist the wind, but do not inhibit my dogs' ability to go through. Though the black plastic is flimsy, it gives a clean appearance inside the wall.If I had it to do over again, I probably would have purchased the single-flap doggy door that was in the wall originally. Since I had to make the hole larger, when I have to replace this doggy door because that black plastic falls apart prematurely, I will be forced to purchase the same product or replace my wall. Considering the price of this product as compared to other doggy doors, I would have expected a higher quality product."

27325,0,"Save yourself some annoyance...what they need to say is that you will constantly have water dripping down the sides of your tank due to condensation build up under the Eclipse Hood. Normally that is not a big deal, but since the Eclipse does not seat very well on top it allows for constant dripping.Marineland will question how long you have had your tank lights on, but since its the same as when I had a glass tank that should not be a big deal."
124803,1,"This ended up working better than the other brand. We purchased front line and it didn't work that well. This one did work great. Immediately, I noticed that our dog minimized scratching. It took about two days for our dog to completely stop scratching. This one was a little cheaper than frontline as well."
162718,1,"This is a product that is pretty much as advertised. The pad is soft and thick. The denim fabric looks nice, although it's pretty thin. It would be nice if the crate drape could be fastened in place, perhaps w/straps across the bottom. The bumper inside doesn't hold up to much tugging and would do better with a more durable fastening system. Notwithstanding those criticisms, if you have a well-behaved dog, I would recommend this product.HOWEVER, If you have a crazy puppy like mine, save your money. My 8 month old Boxer puppy literally destroyed this set within the first day. She shredded the pad and little puffs of fiberfill were all over the place. She pulled the edges of the crate drape cover into the crate and shredded that as much as she could. The bumpers are still intact, but only because I removed them pretty quickly. The shredded crate cover (all that I have left of this set) looks just as bad as the old sheets I was using as a crate cover before! Not a wise purchase on my part."

141641,1,Santa left this under the tree. Our cats had their tails in it as soon as they noticed it. I think the numerous cat naps in only a few days is a positive kitty review.
187280,0,The dog crate is awesome and works great. The three stars is because when it arrived it looked like the box had been thrown down a flight of stairs! The crate was bent but it was not bad enough to warrant returning it.
178564,0,"These sponges are really small and fragile. They would be good for very small bowls, but I have a large crab enclosure with large bowls and these are basically useless for it. Oh well."
177144,0,"Great flyer, but can be destroyed quickly by an agressive dog. I use it on my cattle dog who won't shake it, but not on my blue heeler who chews and shakes and tries to kill the Jolly Pet."
424,0,"Purchased this because one we'd had in the past had a lower-pitched, less annoying squeak. This one had a high pitched squeak....thankfully it was destroyed quickly!I like that this company produces toys with differing sounds but I wish they'd label the toys, and make them consistent."
153286,0,Not what you night be expecting. Looks like chopped up pieces of plastic more than litter.
51250,1,"I just started grooming my poodle at home by myself and realized I did not have any nail clippers so I was really just looking for something inexpensive that would get the job done, and I found it! The nail guard on the back is inaccurate as my husband relied on that to keep from cutting them too short and ended up making my dog bleed, but other than that, great product for the money."
23401,0,"The Shampoo works well, and my groomer recommends it. My Veterinarian also stocks it. It's pretty expensive for use on large dogs. It does loosen scale and improve the skin."
88688,0,"We have 15 rescued cats ranging in age 1 to 21 yrs and 2 house bunnies we purchased this for. Being house cats and bunnies, we are always trying to enrich their lives. We previously had another fountain that we threw out due to cleaning difficulty. This fountain seems to work fine, but living in a multi animal household we get to see many areas for improvements in most products.1. The cord issue. This can be dangerous for animals that chew, our bunnies chew as do some of our cats. It could also be something to get tangled up in. We ran the cord thru pvc pipe so it won't be dangerous.2. Really, we prefer SS but didn't care for any of the SS fountains we found. Also the ones we did find still have plastic, although our animals don't seem to have a plastic issue. It would be nice if this were offered in SS as well.3. I think the people who have a slime issue with fountains in general either don't clean them often enough or don't clean them with the correct product. We use mild bleach, then rinse and air dry.This fountain is quiet enough for us, we actually wish it were a little louder making more of a splashing noise. We don't notice any splash over which is good and have it on a large water proof mat. A boot mat found in home improvement stores would work great and they are around 5.00.We plan on using aquarium filters as they are cheaper. We also won't use hard water in the fountain as it only leads to problems. Our cats for the most part took to the fountain right away, still waiting on the bunnies. We really like the look of the drinkwell lotus ceramic, hoping to see it on amazon soon. Have only seen it at petsmart so far. I'm guessing ferrets and other animals would enjoy this as well. Our dogs which are all larger have ignored it probably because it sits on the floor."
194275,2,This did not work for my 16 year-old dog who was experiencing serious panic attacks.I can only speak to my situation.
147613,0,"First Premier makes great products (Premier Collar is much better than any Buckle collar, gentle leader collar is also great) but this Premier Gentle Spray Commander is my first bad experience with Premier products. The collar works great when it does. To get a very good recall without a leash the beep button was all I needed to teach my dog enforcement can happen without being on leash. The problem with this product is poor reliability. I kept changing the batteries (every 3 or 4 months) until the last change ... the beep quit working. I purchased battery charger tester which confirmed that the previous 4 batteries were still at 95% charge! The problem was that collar works intermittently until finally it decides to break. Quality and reliability is expected for collar at this price level. I will look for a different supplier for my next remote collar with a beep! I still need the remote beep collar because my dog has figured out he has not heard the beep for quite a while now. The minute I get a new collar his collar is going to go back to 100% hit."
2079,2,"I bought this after my previous Eheim filter began losing significant pressure after about 4 years. I was very happy with it, so got this one, which is the newer model of what I had before. It worked great for about 2 months, then began losing pressure. Now, at less than 3 months, it's as bad as my other one was at 4 years. Is the this the new improved model? Not impressed. And not happy with blowing $120!"
131662,0,"its a pretty piece....a little larger than believed.....and a lil more fragile than i would have likes, but still a pretty piece for a tank"
152333,1,"My dog started peeing in her sleep about a month ago, so I searched everywhere on line to see what people were buying for this problem. My vet is also trying to work on this problem to see if he can solve the problem..so far, nothing has helped, so that is why she is now in these diapers/briefs. This product had the highest rating on the Petsmart website, but they no longer sell it. I was so happy to see it here. They wash very easily...I do them by hand since I only wash once a week..and within 24 hours, they are dry by hanging them on a line rack in the house. I do not run them thru the dryer. I got a medium for my cocker spaniel and it works perfectly. I use panty liners...since my dog goes heavily at night, I use the thicker pads at night vs the ligher pads during the day. It has been a learning process for me how to put the pads inside of it. Thank you for offering this."
167065,0,This is a bit over priced for me compares to regular aquarium airstone. But I have to get it because I have biorb tank. It works fine. I have no complain about the quality of it
76414,0,"I bought one of these soft crates for our little Maltese for traveling. Although she is a quiet little pup, she doesn't like us to leave her. It didn't take her too long to figure out how to open this crate where the zipper stops. We foiled her attempts to get out by putting a small pad lock on (2 ) zipper pulls put together. She soon got out again by just clawing at the zipper. This seems a very heavy duty crate, but it takes her less than one minute to work her way out. She likes laying in it, but she won't be kept in. To my disappointment, we ended up replacing it with one of those non collapsible plastic crates for traveling."
68115,1,"I bought six boxes and gave out 4 of them. All my friends said their dogs loved them. Because this treat is soft, it is perfect for young and old dogs with sensitive teeth."
56674,0,"I was not expecting theseto be quite so small in overall size, as they are probably only 1/3 the size of my regular corded clippers. I purchesd them to clip a bridlepath, muzzle, and ears of my horse and they do work well for that purpose. I just can't imagine trying to do anything more than that."
159928,0,"This was a good deal for what we needed, but I wouldn't get if you are going to use it a lot. Quality not the best but it worked for me because my daughter's dog only comes on the boat maybe twice a year and the Vest made it a snap to pull him onto the boat. Would recommend if you need it in a pinch."
125206,1,"We developed a terrible flea infestation when our local flea population became resistant to first Advantage, then Frontline. At first I thought Program wasn't working either, but it took a little over a month to begin really noticing a difference. Now we're not completely flea-free, but it seems to be under control."
145595,2,"WTF are these guys smoking. These are not worth $899.....My dog doesn't quite like this style, they seem to irritate his nails. They're probably worth maybe $5 not $900"
116225,1,I bought this for my son's dog - she LOVES these things! One of the few chews that lasts longer than a few minutes!
114457,1,Got these so my frogs wouldn't starve for lack of food; and they work just fine. Also stays fresh(ish) for a month or so in the fridge.
183709,0,"I ordered this mini ex-pen for my hedgehog.It is smaller than i realized and i had to get another one (from a friend) to hook to it to give her adequate space to gambol about. I don't dislike it but i would like to be able to buy additional panels to add to it. The plastic mat that goes beneath is a nice feature unless, of course, you make it bigger than you don't have enough mat."
21188,0,"The only problem I have with this is the glue. It is ridiculous. the applicator tips get clogged which is a given considering. But you end up getting gloued to yourself and your cat. Mines not agreeable at all so I have to fight with her the whole time. Ive taken to wrapping her in a blanket save for the paw I'm working on and this helps. The glue also gets on her fur and when the caps come off they end up taking a chunk of her fur too and its painful for her. I feel bad with how much it annoys and hurt her, but I figure it hurts a lot less than having her claws ripped out of her so i'll keep this up until it becomes too much...I'm going to try clear nail polish and see how that works"
113727,1,"WE ORDERED THIS BED FOR OUR NEW CHOW PUPPY ""HOPE"". SHE WENT RIGHT TO IT TAKING HER FAVORITE TOYS WITH HER. IT HAS BECOME HER SAFE PLACE. I GUESS THIS MAKES THIS A PERFECT BED, AFTER ALL SHE GIVES IT 2 PAWS UP AND SHE WOULD BE THE EXPERT ON THIS.JERRY WILLIAMS"
77794,0,"The good: our Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this crate. The bad: the divider panel in the crate we received does not fit properly, being that it isn't quite as wide as the crate itself. At first, I solved the problem by using plastic ""zip ties"" to hold the divider in place. As our puppy grew, I was able to move the panel to a location where it fit better, but then it pulled the sides of the crate inward, widening an existing gap at the top of the main door opening when the door is closed. I'd still recommend this crate. I probably just got a bad one."
2624,1,"I am very pleased with this sterilizer. I am using it on my 150 gallon FOWLR system with a moderate bio-load of fish. They all had a mild case if ICH, and since putting this sterilizer in place the ICH has improved. I didn't expect it to cure the ICH, but i think it improved the water quality enough that they were able to keep it in check. Installation was fairly easy and I have had no problems in the couple weeks it has been running."
21043,0,My sister and I both have one of these - hers is a very small dog and mine is a small/medium dog. She got the small band and I got the medium and neither of us can use them though the dogs are within the weight range. It's not a bad product but you definitely need to buy a size up! I don't care for the elastic on the outside edges as it seems to be a bit tight. I have a different belly band that is fleece and doesn't have the elastic - I prefer it b/c it just seems more comfortable for our dog!
133298,0,"We needed to replace a pet carrier too small for our current pets.Shipping was fine. Instructions minimal and reduced to tiny pictographs. Fit of parts is tight, the door is difficult to operate one-handed.Less than 2 weeks after assembling a crack has developed on the backside opposite the door.Sigh...It was very pretty for a little while.Hope you all fare better.Two and a half stars."
17434,2,"I had high hopes for this collar, but after a few days of use, my Westie quickly learned that he could ""out-bark"" the resevoir of Citronella spray (it only lasts for about 25 sprays). This purchase was a total loss for my dog.Oh, well, I guess I'm back to the static shock correction."
64759,0,"I bought ""Greenies"" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff."
167326,0,"Please keep in mind that you cannot return this product. We had a few fleas in our house and I purchased this because we wanted them out fast. Before we even used it - they were gone. So, I tried to return it, but Amazon has a policy that you can't return these types of products. So, I was disappointed in that."
188431,1,"The kitties love these ""mice."" The tails don't last long so I guess it's good they come in a pack of 3. I also needed the actual wand part because the other one was really chewed up. They enjoy these even if i wave them around by hand. The panic mouse doesn't hold their interest for very long so it's nice to be able to manually engage them by taking the wand off. if you don't own a panic mouse your cats can still enjoy these."
70345,0,This shampoo has a pleasant scent and seems to lather well and rinse easily. You have to squeeze gentle because it is very thin. I found that I needed to add additional conditioner/detangler to comb through with more ease. Overall it's ok.
144946,0,The bed was bigger than i expected. It takes up a lot of pace in our little guinea pigs cage. Also it wasnt as cute as it looks in the picture. But all and all it was a good purchase... I mean my guinea pig enjoys sleeping in it and i really cant complain if its just gonna end up full of poop and food.
177960,0,Cat condo was sent within a decent amount of time. It was mostly assembled but it appeared to have been knocked around quite a bit during shippping. There were parts not attached but not too bad. Looks good.
8353,1,"The shavers and trimmers I've bought have all come with a thin, eyedropper sized container of oil.They've all leaked and are easy to lose. Considering that one only adds a couple drops of oil to blades and trim heads on occasion, this generously sized bottle of oil should last a lifetime.The oil dispenses neatly from the container and is easy to control. Just twist the top to open and twist again to seal the deal.I use this oil on my two shavers and my hair and beard trimmers with no problems. Regular oiling keeps the appliances working well and the blades sharp."
7464,1,"I've had cats for 15 years. Litter boxes get kind of gross after 5 or 6 years and need replacing. My previous litter boxes have been Van Ness covered boxes. Some of these boxes have 90 degree corners in them and it is difficult to scrape clumping litter balls from them. These corners are also a bit difficult to clean. I like the Clevercat because it has just four rounded corners. This box is pretty tall and I can put 3"" of litter in it and my cats will still fit in it. It also does a much better job of keeping the cats from tracking litter through the house. Unfortunately, though, my cats will NOT use it with the lid. And one of my three cats won't use it at all. But I still like this litter box even though it is a bit pricey. I have high hopes that a future cat will love this box."
152058,2,"All the Littermaid products I have owned are cheaply made & break easily. This is no exception. I decided to give them another try- the item looked improved from the original big square version of their litter cover. The plastic is cheap and breaks easily. The material is flimsy. My cat peed on it and I washed it, but didn't dry it- it shrunk!!! and wouldn't fit in the frame anymore- I had to throw the whole thing out after MUCH MUCH frustration trying to get the thing back together. Definitely don't waste your money on ANY Littermaid products."
69273,1,"The Solvit waterproof ""Hammock"" seat cover protects our back seats and the back of the front seats. If the brakes are put on suddenly, the dog may slide a little onto the ""Hammock"" part of the cover, but they do not get hurt. It wipes off and is ready in minutes for the next trip."
209624,0,Flys well and fairly tough but my dog had chewed it through in two days. Doesn't float. Good price and would be fine for a dog with a soft mouth.
97710,1,"I bought this crate because I was moving overseas and needed an airline approved crate to ship my Bassett Hound in. Although I paid $49.99 for it, this crate could be sold for double that. It arrived in about a week after I ordered it and came with everything needed to meet the USDA requirments for shipping live animals to include the live animal and directional arrows.There were however two modifications that I had to make for the crate to be excepted by United Airlines. The first was that I had to drill four holes, one near each corner of the opening of the door, to allow the TSA to zip strip the door shut after their inspection. The second was that I had to replace the plastic retainer clips that hold the top and bottom halves together with a bolt/washer/nut stackup. I used 1/4 inch hardware with a lockwasher to accomplish this. Total cost of the hardware was around $15.00 from Home Depot. Both of these modifications are required if you plan to ship this crate aboard any major airline.Overall I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the crate for the price."
175620,1,"I have a cat that gets a pill everyday! I have tried other brand pill guns, but have found them cheap, and not quite what I was looking for. Either they were too thick in the width, or they didn't ""pop"" the pill in like it should. This brand piller has lasted me 5 years, and I am now on my second one because the rubber has deteriorated. The mechanism doesn't stick, and it releases the pill perfectly. Also, because it's long and thin, I'm able to fit it into my cat's mouth, and do it all in a couple seconds, while saving my fingers."
175476,0,"The item was exactly as described and arrived just fine. However, it took an extended amount of time for the order to be processed and the shipping was slow. I ordered several items on this same day and this item took over a week longer than the others to arrive despite having the same shipping speed. I was disappointed by this."
166578,2,"i ordered the super pet hay buffet feeder, it was shipped to me on time but it was shipped out the locking lid wich made the whole feeder useless with out the lid. i just wanted them to send me the lid but for some reason that has been to much to ask for"
157974,1,The Midwest 1542 iCrate is wonderful. For years I messed with the crates that you drop the rods down the sides and they were way to hard to set up. I took a short trip with this new crate and it was simple to set up. I'm very satisified.
51633,1,"I have tried another brand (""Urine Gone"" from Target), but nothing works like Stink-free. For years, my cat sprayed the walls inside the house (no carpet). I had no idea how much he did it until I used the blacklight! He practically painted the walls in one room. Gross! One day, while he was out, we used the blacklight to find the marks and stink free to clean them. Under the blacklight, the urine shows up neon yellow. With one wipe, it erased the yellow, until the walls were all back to normal. When he came back in, he looked really confused as he sniffed around trying to find where he marked. It seemed as if he did not even recognize the house! Since then, he has not sprayed one time inside the house and that was over a year ago. THIS STUFF WORKS! Simply amazing!!!"
149771,2,"Don't buy this. I've already been through two of these things. It's great and stopped my dog from barking, but still broke after only a couple of weeks. The idea behind it totally works for excessive barking, but go with another brand, maybe they have better quality products."
110747,0,"This was a great toy for my beagle, who immediately figured it out and nosed the cube all around the house while the kibble dribbled out. Not so for my pit mix, who didn't have the patience for such antics. Instead she just tried to bite it in half. It didn't take took long for her to be able to do just that. Although I will say the buster cube has lasted longer than some similar interactive toys which took her seconds to destroy, it's now unusable like the rest."
112585,1,"I purchased this product and I am overall satisfied with it.White Pet Panel Medium sized dog.This is not a 15-minute installation product as some reviews have suggested.I wanted this product to fit perfectly, and it took me several days to finally get it where I felt it fit in my patio door the way it should.* Took the product out of the box. It was very well packed.* Opened my patio door and cleaned the bottom track.* Had to immediately run to the Home Depot as I realized the weather stripping they provided was not adequate. Bought Gray Frost King Rubber Foam Weather seal "" wide 7/16""thick 10 foot long roll. Bought Frost King EPDM Rubber Weather seal in white. 5/8' wide 5/16' thick, 10-foot long roll.* Read the instructions. Installed the Patio Panel per instructions. I attached the panel with the screws provided and made sure I had a perfect fit.* Took out the screws, and the panel from the track, and then installed weather seal on the left side of the panel. I used the gray weather seal as I felt the panel needed to be sealed from air coming in. You will not see this weather seal. The instructions don't mention this, but I did not want a draft coming in. It worked perfectly. If you want a good seal so no air comes in you must also place some weather seal on booth sides of the height adjuster. Nowhere in the instructions does it tell you to do this, but trust me. You need to do this.* Installed EPDM Rubber Weather Seal on the right side of the panel. You need white as it looks good on a white patio door.* Place panel back in track and put the screws in the height adjuster.* You will now notice the panel moves quite a bit. To solve this problem I screwed one extra screw in the top of the header to hold it in place. I am still trying to figure out how I can put a screw in the bottom of the track, as I cannot drill that close to the floor. An extra screw needs to be place in the bottom to prevent the panel from moving.* I closed my patio door against the panel. Major problem. I noticed on my patio door there is a screw stub that sticks out and did not align with the hole in the pet panel. I had to temporarily remove some of the white weather strip and drill the hole larger in the pet panel. I then put the weather strip back on. It worked and now when I closed the door both doors touch each other.* I had to now figure how to keep the patio door locked. I was going to use the supplied latch, but to me it didn't look very strong. I decided to take some sprinkler pipe, cut it down to size and put it in the track. This is not as simple as it sounds. After several attempts I finally measured correctly and put the pipe in the track. I immediately noticed the two panels where not tight together. I could see a gap, where the air would come in. I manually pushed the sliding door panel into the pet panel and the gap was gone. As soon as I let go, there was a gap for air to come in. MAJOR PROBLEM. What do I do?* Back to Home Depot, Lowes, Orchard Supply Hardware to find a patio door lock. They do not exist. Plus, do you really want to drill holes in your patio door, and more holes into the pet panel. I didn't.* What do I do now? How can I get the panels to fit together tightly* Answer, buy from Amazon a White Security Bar for a sliding glass door. Around $16.00* I installed the product, Put down the bar, and the two panels now fit together tightly. No air gap. I took the plastic pipe that I used in the track and threw it away. What a pain, having to bend down several times a day to pull out the pipe. The security bar is very simple to use, and there is no bending.* Today I came home and my house was full of grass. I forgot to install the glass sweep weather stripping. It is very important to install this, as it will prevent air and dirt from coming into your home. The only problem with this strip is it is harder now to open and close the door as the rubber strips rubs against the glass.I am now very happy with the panel. It took me 3 days to get it right. I hope I have made it easier for you to install your pet panel."

209177,1,"I purchased this bed for my 60 lb Basset Hound, and he sleeps on it a lot. I haven't had the bed for very long, but it seems to be holding up very well so far. I will change the rating if the bed goes flat before its time. I chose this one because it's reasonably priced and had good ratings. It seems very sturdy and comfortable for my dog."

205681,0,"I had one of the original dog doors from before this company changed hands, it was solid grey, with no window. They were robust, and still work beautifully.I bought another one for a dog house, brown with plexiglass inner door, a few years ago, and it wasn't as good as the original grey one. Lighter weight, and didn't seem to seal as well.This is my third one - building a dog door for my patio slider. The basics are still there - but much more flimsy then the brown one. I'll use it, but its just sad that the quality isn't what it used to be. I'd pay more for better quality."
38605,0,"This product is a manual roll and scoop litter box. If you are looking for a ""true"" self cleaning with motorized cleaning, this product is not for you. But if you don't mind rolling the box every time the cats use the bathroom this would be perfect for you."
75591,0,"I definitely knew what the dimensions were when I ordered this because I needed to make sure it fit the requirements of United Airlines, however, this thing is really small! My dog will fit in it but she barely has room to curl up, she's going to be making the sides bulge to do so. She's a Chihuahua/Terrier, 12 pounds, and about 12"" from collar to base of tail.The mesh windows do seem very durable. My complaint is that the windows aren't big enough to give her much visual while inside. And it's difficult for me to see her inside of it and make sure she's comfortable.Also the backpack ""straps"" are very uncomfortable, there is not padding on them and after wearing it with the dog for a few minutes they started to dig into my shoulders.The top of the carrier has some ""give"" so it should be able to fit under any plane seat. Other carriers I've seen have very stiff piping that don't allow much pushing down on the top--which is good for safety reasons...Overall this carrier has lots and lots of padding to protect the dog on all sides.My last ""complaint"" is that the soft insert that lies on the carrier floor doesn't velcro down, so that could move around a bit but it's not as bad as other carriers I've seen. We're taking her on a flight in about a month, so hopefully all goes well."
139538,1,"Received as described fat shipping, I had a bed that was just like this and my dog loved it."

132272,1,"Just got this collar this week-wish I had ordered it a month ago!! Been struggling with a crazy stubborn 7 month old lab for months. In less than one week, and only 2 or 3 actually corrections, she is like a different dog. I had mixed feelings about using a electronic collar, but since I already have an underground electronic fence(which is the only thing this dog actually respects) I thought I would give it a try. Being trained to the beep of the fence has made her training so easy. As soon as she hears the negative beep she immediately responds. No more jumping on the furniture, counters, stealing from the trash. She has stopped jumping on friends n neighbors-- still working on the piddling problem though."
180793,1,This water silo is really handy. No more having to clean the bird poop out of their old water dish on a daily basis.
81543,0,"This is the second one we have purchased. Absolutely loved the first one. This one is not made as well and the fabric is much thinner and seems that it will be far less durable. I wish they would have left the design alone, it was great before."
32553,2,"They say there is a hum with the fountain. Wrong. It is a roar. Much too loud and I will put it in a far away corner and see if that helps. If not, I will go back to Walmart and get their $16 fountain. Mr. Katz doesn't even go near it. It is probably frightening him with all that noise. Fountain works except for the noise. There must be a way to get a quieter motor. The $16 one from Walmart which doesn't last too long at least is quiet."
16999,1,"We tried many things to help stop our 6 year old beagle from barking at one family member. Every time this person got up and walked around the house, she would follow him and bark. We tried squirt bottles, pennies in a can, leashing her, sit/stay, and nothing worked. The spray collar worked from day one. Because she is such a timid dog, I put it on her upside down so it sprays at her feet and not her face. It is enough to startle her and stop her barking. I wish I found this years ago. The first battery lasted about three weeks. We have only filled the collar once with the spray. She still tries to bark without the collar, but it has made a tremendous difference. She has been barking for 5 years, so I know it will take time. I highly recommend this collar."
152483,2,"Great system...but selling the cheap wire with it is like robbing you...because the want to sell thier even more useless wire break detector system(a complete waste of money). Do your research and buy better wire 14 or16 gauge wire is the best. If you use thier wire you will get a break, it's only a matter of time, or a nick (which is almost impossible to find) and you will have a major major chore in front of you. So again please do your research installing 20 gauge wire is a complete waste of your time and money...buy better wire. Just search eBay. It is easy to install and the system works great when working. That requires a good constant signal and 20 gauge wire just will not deliver that over the long term. Ohh and get a lightning surge protector. They should give you one with system, but the would rather just keep selling you them as they get fried out. Do your research, take a min and do it you won't regret it. This fence can be a pain in the but if you let it. Or a great product if done correctly. Good luck."

I open the door and set him on the front seat and he jumps right in HIS seat. If I run into the store he waits in his seat ... for the few minutes I am inside (car doors locked always). I visit a friend who has a very large dog (145lbs) and even though the 2 dogs seem ok together we decided it is best Reggie stays up and out of the way ... so I brought in the car seat. Reggies jumps right in and stays in it ... he just loves this seat. I believe it keep him safe, secure and warm ... a must have for small dogs!! The seat straps to the middle armrest and has a strap inside the seat that you can hook to the dogs harness/leash so he/she is safe and secure in his seat."

Thats to good part.Now the bad stuff.GOD help you if you have to deal with the company for warranty assistance. They are slow. Figure 3 months to get a replacement.If you live in the South like me you may have a problem finding litter that works. Every litter I have used clogs the Littermaid.In despiration, I cut 1/4 inch off every other tooth on the rake. Now it works purr-fectly.Because it now works with no assistance from me I rate it 3 stars."
154505,2,"The motion detector on this system is not very good. Even if my cats spend a fairly long time in the tray doing their business, the motion detector only trips the scooper sometimes (the light blinks while they're in the tray, indicating that the motion sensor knows they are there, but once they've gone it's supposed to keep blinking until the poop has dried and it auto-scoops. Instead it stops blinking when the cats leave the tray and it never scoops). It has gone for days not detecting the cats, then might work once. In the meantime, the tray has gotten full of poop. When it does work, it's pretty good, but after 2 weeks (with 2 cats) it stinks! And I've had to scoop out the poop at least every 4th day to keep it from getting overly full (it has a very small 'reservoir' for the old poop).I'm not impressed. I don't have to scoop every day, but I do have to push the button myself to make it work, so it isn't useful for the long weekends away I'd hoped it would be great for."
171016,2,"I bought this feeder because it looked sturdy; it's very, very heavy and appeared to be durable. Those attractive pewter-look supports are solid PLASTIC which cracks quite easily. First the shingles started falling off the roof, which I reapplied with hot glue. Then the first time a squirrel knocked it out of a small [6 ft high] tree (this item is not squirrel resistant as one tag indicates), the bottom broke in two and the ""pseudo metal"" supports broke in half. This feeder is attractive, but after you buy some feeders three and four times, you learn to buy the best. Attractive as it is, looks aren't everything. I would not recommend this feeder and have replaced mine with a Stokes Wire Mesh Seed Feeder.Striped sunflower seed offers less nutrition, though they appear bigger because the heart floats around in the shell. Black oil is preferred by more types of birds; mixed bird seed will attract rats and mice as the larger birds come along and knock all the small seed out of the way to get to the black oil."

I tried sitting them right in front of the screen but they never noticed the gerbils or birds. The lower rating is only because it did not work for my group of cats. The quality of the video was excellent.

Bottom line, if you are not on a completely flat lot, be aware it may not work! I give it 3 stars for the very courteous customer service, otherwise the product itself is a 1 for our home."

207369,0,"For some reason, I expected the three dog dishes I ordered to be ceramic; I guess because they're called crock dishes. So I was disappointed when I received plastic dishes. The color in the picture also is incorrect. Although the dishes appear to be off white, they're really more on the grey side w/black dots, which doesn't exactly go well with my flooring.That said, I kept them because ceramic dishes are too costly, and these dishes serve the purpose. I believe a better description would have avoided disappointment on both the material and the color, and also would have made me decide against ordering them."

No known address, dog name, no attempt to contact the owner, nothing. The owner hadn't paid the registration fee.

110887,0,"I was disappointed with the cube. It is almost impossible to open. Finally I used the handle of a pair of pliers, after seeing a video on youtube, and I tore up the handle of the pliers opening it, it was that hard. The kibble either doesn't come out, and my dog gets frustrated and barks, or it comes out 5 pieces at once, and I have to refill it all the time. It also slides along the ground more often than it rolls over to dispense kibble. Maybe that's because my dog is too small to roll it? He's 6 pounds.One more thing, the instructions both on the product and Buster Cube's website refer to ""min"" and ""max"" settings. There is no such thing on the cube, only ""lock"" and ""unlock"" settings.My dog loves it though, so it gets 3 stars."
179283,2,"I got this feeder for use at a cabin in Colorado. On the plus side, it is easy to clean and refill, it does have a conveniently large capacity, and it's coloration attracts a lot of birds. At the same time I bought this, I also bought a different brand feeder locally for 1/3 the price, also large capacity, also easy to clean and load, and also attractive to lots of birds. Shortly after hanging these, they were all attacked by a bear. The cheap ones survived intact, this Perky Pet one did not. For the price, I'd go with the cheaper more bear resistant ones and can get 3 for the price of this one."

183944,0,"I have 4 dogs,2 malamutes 1 husky and a malamute husky mix. They are strong willed dogs that do not give up easily. Most people who have owned this breed know that once this kind of dog gets loose be ready to chase them for a long time. My femal the husky who is only 55lbs constantly jumps out of her kennel which is a 7ft chain link fence then jumps out of the main yard which is a 6ft wood fence. She will do this over and over again every day. She has a crush on the dog across the street so she jumps their 6ft fence and hangs out with him for a while on her adventures. We put fencing along the top so when she tried to jump she would hit her head and not be able to make it over, but she figured out how to climb over that. Her 7 month old son is also learning moms favorite trick. Luckily we are not to close to any major roads. We live pretty deep in the woods but we do have some neighbores who do not know the difference between a wolf and a husky and have tried to shoot them. When we first put he collar on her it worked great at keeping her in the yard but she was so afraid of getting shocked she would only move around in a 10ft radious by the house, she wasn't getting any exercise and she was going potty in that area so it was getting messy. It took a couple of weeks to get her to understand she can use most of the yard without getting shocked. Everything was working out great. With her staying in the yard her pup stayed to. We were able to take her collar off for a few days and train one of the other dogs without her even knowing it was gone. It was great with him too. For the first time in 7 years I could open the front door to let him go potty without putting him on a leash, I could leave the front door open and he would come out and just lay on the front porch or in the grass. He was still doing this 2 weeks after I took the collar off. All they neighbores were amazed. This was a huge relief for us. Having so many dogs that have to be on the leash when out of the house was stressfull and a pain not to mention a pain for the neighbores when they got loose. They would try to dart out the door all the time. The collar took all those problems away. Until...this is my only complaint so far....the battery went dead shortly after I put it back on my female. She got compfortable with the collar and started testing the parimeter. One day it didn't go off and she jumped and took her pup with her. We didn't know they were getting loose because they were jumping at night and back in before we got up in the morning. They would jump out again when we went to work and be loose all day while we were at work. A lady who lived a block away said they would follow her on her 7 mile run 3 days a week. I asked her why she didn't report it ""it would make me nervous to have strange dogs follow me"" she said because every time she turned around they would wag their tails and they looked so happy, she liked the company and it made her feel safer. When we finaly found out and replaced the battery it was too late, they had to much fun that week so she was again constantly testing it which made her battery die very quickly, before you know it they were out again. How did we fix it....we baught a collar for her son, he doesn't have the guts to take a chance at getting schocked and she doesn't like getting loose without her sidekick so they hang out in the yard until we take them out to run. Hopefully this continues to work. Once we get a better idea of how long the batteries are lasting we can change them out when we think it is getting close. Eventually they will learn that they will allways get shocked. So this system can work for even the smartest dogs....you just may have to work at it too in the beginning."

42430,1,My dog loves this carseat. The only drawback I found was that it is very difficult to get it strapped down securely so that it does not slide back and forth on the console. A skidproof fabric on the bottom would make this a great item.
185223,0,I was hoping it would be easier to take the top off and put back on to access the dog food. You have to line up 2 ridges in the top to put the lid back on and they don't seat straight everytime so it's not exactly effortless. It's OK

99364,1,I really liked this product but it just didn't work out for me. I bought two for both of my dogs and the problem I ran into was I never knew if each dog was eating their own food or if one was eating both. I would have liked this product better if you could actually set it by the time instead of trying to figure out in 2 hour intervals what time you want it to open each day. Resetting it was a bit of a pain due to that.
168016,0,"Laterite is not widely used anymore as a substrate in aquariums, but I have found it very useful for substrate maintenance. I use a red-flourite layer in the substrate that puts less debris and fine dust in water. But I am not one to change out the whole substrate every couple of years. So the more clay like laterite is useful for replenishing the lost nutrients in the flourite layer by balling up the laterite and pressing it into the substrate.All in all, this product is well boxed and packaged so its easy to store it until its needed."

I bought this water fountain hoping she would enjoy the running, fresher water and get away from the toilet and the running faucet water. First of all the bowl is much smaller than I hoped for. Also I put the water filter in; I tasted the fountain water afterwards and it tastes like chemicals; so I rinsed the container out, cleaned it and then tried again; water tastes bad. I took the filter out and decided I would just clean the fountain everyday. The water tastes better. Has anyone thought to taste the water before you give it to your animals. No wonder Isabella wasn't drinking that water. I am not so happy with the way this unit is made. It seems to be missing the point; why no stainless steel, try and figure out how to keep water clean without charcoal filters, bigger bowls and lips, taller water fountain and much better instructions. Will keep this but will not purchase another until things have changed."

38494,1,"I love my cats but for years I've sworn that I will never own another one. Cleaning the cat box is just too much of a pain. I've tried electric cat boxes, huge scoopers and whatever else I could think of. I was ready to buy the litter genie self washing cat box just to not have to deal with it but I sucked it up and tried this out.It's amazing. I don't understand how anyone is giving this less than four stars. The only time I've had litter fall out at all was when I wasn't paying attention and the drawer part where the litter falls into wasn't closed all the way. It hasn't happened since. Also, the complaints about the litter sticking to the sides has been a non issue for us. We simply do the process a little slower so that it stays stuck to the sides and bottom. Then we hit the sides and bottoms and it all falls to the top section. After that it works as normal.Some have had dust problems apparently but we haven't. We use Arm and Hammer cat litter and it works like a charm.The most important thing I can think to say is that you need to wait a while after your cat uses the restroom. My parents came over and I showed my dad. He lost it and wanted me to show my mom right after the cat used it. Since it was still wet it stuck to the top part when I turned it upside down. Oh well, live and learn.If you hate cleaning cat boxes this thing will make your life a million times easier. It takes seconds to do and is very clean for you. I may actually own another cat now."
515,0,"This is a good product to soften eye area discharge, but it doesn't do much to remove tear stains on my white poodle. Still, I like this product because it does make it easier to clean the eye areas. I do not want products like Angel Eyes that use various chemicals that are fed to the dog to take care of eye stains. So, though not perfect, this is a pretty good help in keeping the eye areas clean."
81279,0,"The concept of this toy is cute, but I think it works better with dogs that are ""critical thinkers"" versus ""literal thinkers."" My dogs love plush toys and they both love playing with the eggs, but neither of them ever caught on to the hide and seek aspect of egg finding. One of them totally lost interest once the eggs were hidden inside. I guess with her it was out of sight out of mind. She never made an effort to look for the eggs even when she saw me put them inside. The other dog took a more literal approach. She never bothered to look for the pouch opening, she instead made her own opening by chewing straight through the dinosaur's back. She did successfully release the eggs, however the toy was ruined for any future play. I guess it could serve as an IQ test of sorts which my dogs clearly failed. Still, the toy could be fun for a dog who cares to figure it out. At the very least, they still enjoy the eggs. I would say, if you think your dog is a critical thinker or just want to find out, buy this toy; otherwise go for the egg refills."

49009,1,"I have only one negative point: holding the clippers pointing towards the end of the dog's nails from underneath is a bit challenging. It's tough to describe, but imagine flipping a Corgi on his back and going in for the back paws by leaning over his body a bit. It's tough to cut that direction because of the guard and the positioning. It seems to get too close to the actual paw pad. Works fine cutting downward though. Just pointing that out for anyone who cuts their pup's nails with the dog's head towards yourself and the body away.Other than that minor quibble of mine (not docking stars because of it since it's just a personal preference), this is a great deal. I paid around $18 for my last pair from Petsmart, and it was cheaply made. This is the real deal. The grip is fantastic and prevents slipping. I don't use the guard, since it causes more bleeding issues than not. I cut my pup's nails typically once every 2 weeks, so they are not long enough to use the guard without hitting the quick.I also think these may be a bit too large for my Corgi, but the other size is surely too small... what to do? But I make do. They cut very well, though they have a bit of a noisy click that can startle a pup that is not used to being home clipped. I have a Corgi, and they are notorious for being overly sensitive with their paws. I cannot have the groomer clip his nails because he tries to kill them and chew their hand off. Yet at home, with these clippers he is cool as a cucumber. I tried the Pedi-Paws and that was a surefire NO. The Pedi-paws just tended to freak him out more than anything.So I heartily recommend these clippers. Just be sure to use your sight and judgement more than the guard. You can see the quick growing through the nail in good light, so just don't cut that far down. If you're worried about your pup jerking, then use the guard, just be sure not to cut all the way as low as the guard indicates if it would cut the quick. I recommend having styptic powder nearby just in case.So basically, if you know what you're doing, these are great. If you're not sure how to cut your dog's nails, then please ask a friend or the vet to show you first."

582,2,"I purchased this water bowl for use at the dog park. It seems fairly sturdy and has a nice squat shape that would be hard for a dog to accidentally knock over. It also holds a pretty good amount of water.I wish the blue cap were easier to screw on. It usually takes me several tries because it seems to want to cross thread.The main issue I have, though, is that the blue cap fills with less than an inch of water under normal operation. The water level rises significantly when I apply pressure to the other end of the container using my foot. Once I release the pressure, the water level falls back down.This is a problem at the dog park for two reasons:1. I have to remain standing nearby the Water Boy in order to dispense water (with foot pressure) for the thirsty dogs.2. Quite a few dogs are too nervous to drink water while I've put my foot down right next to their noses."

The sherpa inside was nice and soft but the bed was labeled as XL large but for my 91 lb Doberman, it is not large enough."

He purrs while I furminate it and then he meows and rebels. It doesn't matter though because it does not hurt him in any way, and it gets all his extra hair off. I tried two other brushes before the furminator - and the furminator is the only one that worked. The first time I tried it, I accumulated a trash-bag worth of extra fur. I highly recommend this product"

140463,2,"Our Alexandrine isn't a picky guy, and he certainly munched on this contentedly. My first clue that maybe this was going to be a one-time only purchase- the much touted easy open zip top seal died the second time I tied to open the bag. To add insult to injury, I think the bird food at Amazon sits in the warehouse for awhile; it was full of seed moths! I ended up throwing it out before we'd used 1/4 of the bag. So if you decide to bit the bullet and buy this, keep a bag clip handy and either store it in the freezer, or invest in some of those pantry moth pest traps."
43603,0,"Ah the controversial Swheat scoops litter! Does it breed bugs? Does it stick to the bottom of litter boxes? Do pets gorge themselves on it? You won't know until you try it in your home with your animals. However, know this... One of my cats love sleeping in it! Ok now that I have your attention, keep reading.From my own trial and error instead of reading the instructions, Swheat Scoops likes to be used with a deep layer of about five or six inches or so in a normal box. Otherwise, you get that odoriferous oatmeal cookie dough consistency stuck to the bottom of your litter box.The Litter Robot II doesn't work well with Swheat Scoops litter. Unlike a conventional litter box, you can't simply add more than the recommended litter to the Litter Robot II. If you add too much litter, the excess gets dumped into the waste receptacle. And there in lies the problem. Since the litter isn't deep enough, the cookie dough sticks to the flexible rubber bottom of the globe! The cookie dough sticks so well to the rubber, that when the rubber flops out when the globe is fully inverted, the cookie dough won't let go! That's sticky... and Stinky too.So folks with normal boxes, double up the depth and you'll be fine. People with Litter Robot II's, don't use it or you'll end up taking a litter scoop to your globe. Quite ironic since didn't you want to stop using a litter scoop when you got your Litter Robot II? Also, I noticed that my normal litter scooper didn't sift the excess swheat scoops too well. It felt like I was tossing out a lot of the good with the bad. So maybe a scoop upgrade is necessary too."
110784,0,"Our very smart, very small dog, who is a Papillon and Jack Russel mix, really enjoys this toy. However, I find it frustrating that the cube just won't come apart for cleaning as it is supposed to. We actually returned the first one we bought because it wouldn't open, but the replacement cube won't either. The hygiene issue is unpleasant for the owner--but I guess it's not such a big deal, since from the dog's point of view, clean things are less fun than dirty ones!"
108974,1,"We bought this training collar for our very stubborn, strong-willed, disobedient terrier. What a difference it made! He would bark constantly and run off every chance he got. This collar has actually given him more freedom because he knows where his limits are. He absolutely hates the beep this gives off. Now we only have to use it once in a while if he gets forgetful. The transmitter uses one 9-volt alkaline battery, and the receiver uses two CR2032 batteries. The batteries in the receiver usually last a month or two and the battery in the transmitter lasts much longer. (Be sure and turn off collar when not in use!)"
205094,2,This object looks good on a shelf. Just don't let your dog near it. Lasted less than ten minutes before the stuffing was out and the ball was riped to shreds. I have an eighten pound terrier not a wild animal!!! Save your money!!!
158915,1,I bought one of these harnesses for my pitbulls because my female use to like to keep a lot of tension on her leash when we walked. With this she CAN'T & doesn't pull at all. I then got one for my male. I have much more control & they behave much better when they have the gentle leader head collar than if I have their regular harnesses on. I would recommend this to anyone that has a dog that pulls too much while being walked. Works GREAT! It comes with a cd to teach properly how to use & train the dog how to get use to it.

However, this spray has a strong scent and it scared my puppy away when i first applied it on my slipper, but it seemed not last long enough that my puppy kept chewing on my slipper after 30 mins. I would say this item works only when you apply it within the first 5-10 mins, once the smell fade away, you will have to re-apply it often enought in order to prevent puppy for chewing..."
152248,2,"This feeder was a huge disappointment. The cover is hard to attach. It take several tries to get the grooves and grippers to match, especially when its no longer new. Lots of seeds spill in the process. After just a few months the color of the plastic (the entire thing is plastic) started to fade. The cover has warped a bit making it even harder to close securely that before.The ring to hang it from is short so it's difficult to hang unless you add chain. The bottom serves as a perch and is very narrow and is part of the base- no drainage holes. Rain collects in it, the seeds get all wet and stick together and rot. Water gets into the storage area and the seeds in there clump so they don't come out for the birds. Then they rot and /or sprout. I have to take it down and clean it out each time it rains.Squirrels love it. Birds and owners, not so much. I would not buy it another and do not recommend it at all."

124365,0,"Based on other reviews, I expected these rawhide chips to be much thicker than they were. The two bags I received were about medium thickness overall, with some thin pieces mixed in. Also, they changed the picture and seller right after I ordered them, so I don't know if future orders will receive the same thing I did. (The rawhide chips I received looked much lighter in color than the current photo, more like the ones you find in stores, and came in two 1-lb bags.)Initially, my dog took the rawhide, walked around with it, sniffed it and then walked away. He came back to it an hour or two later and ate it and hasn't done that again, so maybe it was just a slightly new smell to him. Now he loves them and they barely hit the floor before he snags them and runs to his pillow to chomp on them."
2612,1,Our Mini Schnauser has comedo syndrome and this shampoo really does the trick. It removes the bumps and helps heal him up for a week or so at a time. Initially we were using it 3x a week as prescribed by our vet and now down to weekly. Well recommended.

101600,0,"My vet recommended a drinking fountain when poor kitty developed a urinary infection. Went to the pet shop and bought this item. First it is rather clumsy to put together and take apart for cleaning and the ""stem"" seems like it would break easy. Second, as the previous review stated, if you don't top it off daily the unit becomes noisy. Third, my cat wouldn't go near it at first. I tried to outsmart the cat (not always that easy). Put the base down filled with water for a few days without it running or the dome attached. Let his normal water dish run dry and he ""chose"" the fountain on his own. After that added dome for a few days. Once I was sure he was ok with the unit I went ahead and plugged it in. He still ignores the water running off of the dome but does accept drinking from it. I must add that he drinks a LOT of water now, probably because it is always cool, fresh and clean. It is a good item if you are willing to keep it topped off with water 1-2 times a day and are willing to train your cat to use it. Just a note, my cat is 4 and was never a faucet drinker so the moving water is new to him, if that helps.**EDIT** To stop the noise buy the blue catit placemat. Since using the placemat the only noise I hear is the running water unless the unit is very low on water."

166285,1,"To people who say the plastic is brittle: totally untrue....these lids are more flexible than my dog's frisbees (dog frisbees are more flexible than regular frisbees). Also when I first order them I wasn't sure if it would fit my can because it said 3.5 inches and my can was 3 and 3/8 inches precisely (it's a wide and short 5.5 oz can). Not only does it fit, but it also fits a slightly smaller size (the regular tall and narrow 6 oz campbell's soup size can) because it has an inner ring built into the lid. So you should order this without reservation! Happy food saving!"
88059,0,"From the descriptions, I thought that this product would be larger. If I'd known how small it is, I would have bought the ""Big Dogs"" waterer. The pump is noisy, but I've had it for 6 months and it still works. I like the collection grate that does not allow debris into the pump. My cats and dogs love drinking from this product. They will not touch the regular water dish.I would definately recommend some sort of pet fountain."
169547,1,"The catnip in this is so strong; you can really smell it. And the cats really, I mean *really*, love it. Besides the wonderful nip, there's the shape, which lends itself to frenzied bunny kicking of the toy. This is a must-have toy for the cats here."
215219,0,"My cats love this fountain. They like to play in the water and to drink from the circulating water in the basin. My cats also like it when I put a few ice cubes in there to play with. That said, the pump frequently stops working, preventing the flow of water down the ramp, and makes very loud gurgling and sucking noises. I can't help but feel frustrated that I have to deal with this problem approximately every few days. When it works, it is great, but the rest of the time it just sucks energy from the outlet but doesn't serve its purpose. I am bummed and wish that these problems could be resolved because my cats really do love it. Great product idea, poor execution.UPDATE: After the pump completely stopped working and I was unable to exchange it with Amazon, I decided to dismantle this thing entirely to see what was going on. I removed the pump and saw that tons of cat hair had become stuck at the entrance to the pump filter and blocked the flow of water. I was able to remove most of it and it resumed working upon reassembly. Today, the fountain works again and my cats are please...for now. I assume this will happen again, as I have a long hair feline who loves to dip her paws in the basin. It is a pain to take apart and reassemble, but it is better than being broken for good!"

191223,0,"For as much noise as this little thing makes, it should have an air tube that sits on the bottom that will blow fallen debris (that has sunk to the bottom of the bowl) into the suction area to be filtered out of the water.That little pump makes as much noise as my 50 gallon fish tank filter system. We even put it on a rubber mat and it still makes a lot of racket. We'll have to see if the cats ignore the noise and use the system or if we'll be sending it back."

They are in my bedroom and at night, as well as day, I can hear the water gurgling. I fixed the problem by bending the filter cartridge back a little to overlap the water hole. That silenced them enough to live with. They still hum fairly loudly. I may sell one and get another Top-Fin 30 and keep the other as an emergency backup. I won't be buying any more."
157743,1,I just purchased a French Bulldog puppy recently and she is being housebroken. This crate comes with the sectioning piece needed to make smaller while she is still a puppy so she will not soil in it. She still soils in it but she does not like it ONE bit. She has started to soil less in it now as she is figuring out she needs to go outside. This crate is fabulous and does its job. It's a good purchase and good quality. Has a handle on it as well if I need to carry her to the tub in case of an accident so I can wash everything at once.
31511,0,"I have a very unique situation of a large number of cats at home, sort of a small cat sanctuary (more than 10 indoor only cats). I had high hopes that this would help calm things down and put an end to the skirmishes. I read many reviews and think that for those 2 or 3 cat households, this will work fine. But after a week, I have not seen a marked improvement, in fact one of my cats peed right next to it. I purchased diffusers based on the description of ""600 +/- square feet"" but maybe because we have so many cats, we might need more diffusers. If you have a large number of cats, consider getting one for each room. I am."
78712,2,"The harness didn't really stop my dog from pulling. I have a very energetic 45 lb mixed breed that isn't well socialized or leash trained. I was hoping this would help with the latter. It did deter her from pulling, but not without constant pressure and redirection from me. And it did very little to discourage her when she saw a squirrel or a mouse that looked worth chasing. I didn't lose control of her, but my arm was definitely sore when we got home. We went for a mile walk for the test run, and I checked her immediately for signs of irritation that many other users have reported. She had a big red spot under her leg, no broken skin or lost fur, but I will not put her through that again."
110651,0,"These collars are made two full inches too short. The 10"", which I bought, measure only 8 inches from the mid-buckle clasp to the furthest hole. I'm using these as ID tag straps for equipment and luggage, and I'm actually happy that they are much shorter than comparable pet collars. I can't find 8"" pet collars anymore. They are also somewhat defective because the stitched end that wraps around the buckle is wrapped the opposite way most ""normal"" pet collars are done, with the raw side on the outside of the collar. Again, compared with the other pet collars I've purchased, the raw side is so rough that you wouldn't actually want it rubbing against your pet's neck. But it is less attractive this way, to be sure, though it won't affect the performance of the collar. The red is a nice deep red, and the quality of the strap and buckle are otherwise fine."

It has a cover that is waterproof (for wee wee) then just fluffy stuff inside.This fluffy lining inside is really cheap so I could have replaced it when I needed to (she ate it when I was cleaning ""her home"") but we were in a remote location.--And by ""cheap"" I mean doesn't cost much to get a same size piece to replace it.I have no complaints what so ever. I love this carrier.

My only complaint would be that the feeders are a bit noisy when they rotate, but now that the cats realize that the noise means food is available, they run to the feeders!I also want to note that one of the feeders I bought had a defective digital clock, and the manufacturer promptly replaced it with a new unit.

193929,1,This is a good choice for larger active dogs. It can take a beating and keep going. The installation is pretty standard.

Will require non-DIY people to hire a contractor for install.
27042,2,"Suppose to work quietly, and I have two of them, neither is silent. Kind of sounds like water rushing. I keep them under the fish tanks in the stand to lessen the noise. I called their support line as parts were missing. The person I spoke to was very kind and willing to help me out and sent the parts out without giving me any grief. I asked about the canister not filling up all the way thus making the water rushing noise, she said after a long pause that it was normal operation of said filter.Putting the filters together was not very simple. Nothing has broken on me but I can see how people don't like the very plastic feel for something that is expensive as these canister filters are.The media is a little difficult to work with when taking out the old to replace.The only good design of the whole filter, the fact that the body will disconnect from the motor so you do not have to unplug the unit from the wall, or in my case, the power strip behind the tank stand that isn't easy to get too.Over all not a bad filter because it does clean the water pretty well, but the design flaws it has and the noise force me to give it two stars."

You will still end up cleaning the cat box and resetting it every time there is a problem and the box malfunctions. You must buy special litter, (their brand) because if you don't it works even worse. You will also now have to buy odor charcoal pads and plastic poop trays periodically, (their brand) so once you invest in this product they have you over the cat box. There products are not cheap to purchase and they don't even give you any free coupons to excite you about it. The motor is way under powered and will cause the unit to reset when it gets stuck sweeping into the dump tray."

98465,0,"The product helped the older larger dogs a LOT more than what was offered locally or at the vet, but didn't kill ALL the fleas. I was just grateful that they were no longer scratching 24/7. However, when we treated Mom's 9 pound, 9 month old Yorkie-poo he had a severe reaction and went into shock and we thought we were going to lose him. He lived thanks to the vets suggestions. I'd test with a drop and wait at least 4-5 hours to make sure yours can tolerate it because it can't be thoroughly removed from their systems. If a reaction occurs you need to bathe them immediately with lots of soap and water to dilute what's on the skin and hasn't been absorbed, encourage them to drink lots of water, and keep them walking and awake until they start to rebound from the effects. As far as our vet knew, there is nothing else that can be done to save a pet from a severe reaction to any of the drops that are out, so treat them like you would yourself with any chemical you put on your skin and just try a tiny bit first."

My big Koi hit the food when feeding and knock the pellets out of the ring. I also tried a small Hula Hoop and an 8 ft piece of garden water hose and the same thing happened, with each one. Easier to turn the skimmer /filter pump for an hour or two till they are finished eating, what was tossed into the pond."
154750,0,"Had this box about 6 months now. The crystal little does a much better job of absorbing odor than clay or corn litter. Also does not track nearly as much. I've had very few problems with the box--though one of the teeth in the rack has broken off. Starts out as a 5-star product (light-years ahead of Littermaid). I'm subtracting one star because the litter cartridges do not come close to lasting 30 days. I have one 9lb cat and the cartridge lasts one week. Sometimes I can stretch it to 10 days, but by then my kitty is not happy and you can really smell urine! Subtracting a second star due to the maintenance costs--the refill cartridges are very expensive and it adds up to about $70 every month to maintain the box. I try to re-use each cartridge tray a couple of times with cheaper crystal litter--but this is annoying as it defeats the purpose of having such an easy box."
44310,1,"Compared to the Drinkwell fountain I had previously - it's a much better fountain for a number of reasons.Good things:- Quiet. When it's running properly, you can't hear a thing.- Doesn't make the water too warm. This is important because with the Drinkwell fountain, the motor would get hot and warm the water - not only do the cats dislike this, but it leads to an increased chance of bacteria formation. I honestly don't know how it keeps the water cool, but it does.- Filters are cheap. You can get 2 or 3 packs at Petsmart for cheap, or get them from Ebay for even less.- Material is easy to clean. The entire unit is made of a very smooth plastic that makes it very easy to clean. The Drinkwell fountain was made of a rough material that ""trapped"" food particles and made it difficult to clean.As much as I like it, there are some things that definitely need to be improved:Bad things:- The motor traps hair easily. Hair gets caught in the motor and you have to remove the hair almost weekly. If not, you'll find the fountain doesn't work properly and you have to keep turning it on and off.- There's a plastic piece on the main water reservoir that's so thin that it breaks easily. I've broken it twice when cleaning it - luckily customer service is great and they send me free replacements.- There's an issue with the motor where if you turn it off to add more water, then turn it on, it'll make a loud bubbling noise as it tries to get water up to the top. It fixes itself if you turn it on and off repeatedly, but it's a pain.I usually let the fountain run 2-3 days. By then, the reservoir is more than half empty so I'll empty the entire thing, give it a quick wipe, then refill it with fresh water. Once a week, I clean it with dishsoap and use a Q-tip to clean out the motor. I'm told it isn't necessary, but I like the idea of a clean fountain.Overall, this is much better than the Drinkwell fountain. Not perfect, but definitely one of the best out there. I paid $50 and it's since dropped to just over $25, which is a great deal."

47035,0,"I have a German Shepherd. She is over 50 lbs. and long. The jacket seems to float her back end very high, forcing her head to be low in the water. The jacket needs some additional support under the chin area for a dog that is larger. She has a hard time keeping her head above the water since her tummy and rear are so high. We have tightened the front (neck area) as much as possible to bring the jacket forward on her body, but it has not helped.I also have a Yorkie and her small jacket on her small body works great.So, if you have a small dog, I recommend this jacket. If you have a large dog, you might consider getting the less attractive jacket, which I have found to work much better with this size dog."
10645,1,"I don't use this for my dog but rather for my two tabby cats when we make a family trip up north to the cabin. I put both of them in there with some food, a small litter box and some toys and they are good to go for 3+ hours. Occasionally I unzip the door and let them out while I drive as one of my babies doesn't especially like the car. He hops up on top and sleeps while the other rests inside. Does the trick. I've had this product for years. It's been from Chicago to Michigan to transport 3 of my friends cats as well. The space really helped the long drive. I also used this when housing a pair of stray cats and their kittens. Big enough for the whole family to feel safe and with the window flaps down it cut down the wind to keep them warm.My only complaint which is part of my own doing is that this takes up the entire truck space of my Jeep Cherokee. Still leaves the backseat for packing but makes it hard to carry more then one or two human passengers. I rarely do on long trips so its not a deal breaker. If you have a puppy or particularly excitable dog this might not be the right option. It is after all fabric. Its tough but it will rip if you're too rough with it. If you have an older dog or one that isn't going to jump on top of it, this would be perfect."
4594,0,"I bought this for my large Syrian hamster about a week ago. She will run across it, and sit in it for a second...and maybe eat in it BUT she (to my sadness) won't sleep in it or even sit in it for any amount of time. In fact, usually when she crawls across it it bends out of shape so much that there is no room for her to really fit in it/lay down in it. Another major problem with this ""cozy cup"" is that she chews on it constantly and at the same time is eating in the process (something that I have read can be very harmful to her health.) This is the main reason that I took this out of her cage, other than the fact that it just seems to take up a lot of space without any real function. One thing good I can say about this item is that it looks very attractive in the cage; the various colors match almost any cage setup out there. The sherpa lining looks cozy enough that it makes me want to snuggle up in it! I just wish my hamster felt the same way :( While this may be great for other small animals I do not advise it for hamster as they WILL NOT USE IT."
78373,0,"This feeder lasted me almost two years.Pros:- It has nice capacity.- I've had hummers fighting for a chance to use it.- Low price.- Did not leak, even after the base cracked (see below).Cons:- Low-grade plastic. Hanging in full sun, the clear plastic bulb yellowed within weeks. And recently, it developed an inch-long crack. It hadn't been dropped, but I believe the sun weakened the plastic over time. Also, the base cracked maybe a year ago at the spot where the bottle screws in (I didn't tighten it THAT hard).- Not easy to clean. The base has nooks and crannies inside that no brush seems able to reach.- Has to be overturned to fill. Which is a pain and means anything left in the bottom bowl will spill onto your hands."
167457,0,"It doesn't really spin, my bunny just plucks hay from it occasionally and that's about it. He eats more hay from the floor than out of this thing. I recommend getting a regular hay holder or something cheaper, if available. This item works but only just as good as a regular stationary hay holder. On the negative side, it's a bit of a pain to refill every time."

179658,0,"It was great the first time we got it. However, in about 3 weeks, it didn't work as well. We have 2 dogs (7 yr old pit mix & 11 yr old Shepherd mix). It's great for our pit mix but now the device does not really bother the Shepherd mix -- maybe her hearing is not as sensitive any more and she is just stubbord. It seems that when the device is set on ""ultrasonic"" the dogs kept on barking, but when it was set on ""audible"" it made a difference. The sound gets annoying and for sure the neighbors could hear it. We'll continue using the device, but I already ordered a collar for the Shepherd mix to use at certain hours. Hopefully this will work."
30299,0,"I've given this product a good run of 4-5 months of use. My cats thought it was strange at first, but they used it. My biggest complaint is that it only stays fresh smelling for 3-4 days. A few days after changing out all of the litter it begins to take on a damp, sickly sweet corn smell--not a cat pee smell, but yucky nevertheless. I clean the 2 litter boxes twice a day (two cats in the house), and the pee clumps are fairly hard but tend to crumble more easily each day as the litter loses freshness. In other words, you really need to change out the litter every two weeks, which gets expensive. If you go longer than two weeks, the litter just smells offensive. I'm returning to cat crystals."
155545,0,"I've ordered this item 3 times now. The first couple of times, I received a box which said that the color of the unit was walnut, but the product inside looks nothing like the picture. The color is way, way closer to the espresso version. Much darker than the picture.I called Amazon, and they said that they would go manually inspect the remaining units to figure out what was going on and correct the problem. They said that the item would be marked as ""under review"" on the site, and that a week or two later it would go back to purchasable, at which point I should buy it again. I did. It was ""almost-espresso"" again. I gave up and put it together. I've had it for a few days now.Once assembled, it seems ok--during construction, the materials felt sort of cheap, even for particle board / composite furniture, so don't tighten anything too tight when you're putting it together. I would also recommend using a hooded cat-box inside, as some other reviewers have mentioned that cat spray produces warped, ruined (and smelly) particle board if you don't know it's there and leave it sitting for too long. The assembled size surprised me: it's a bit big for a nightstand (but close enough), and the fact that it's deeper than it is wide makes it look kind of funny as a nightstand, at least to me. But again, it's close enough.Given that I can't find another product which is quite like this one (I'm not interested in a faux-potted-plant cat-box), it seems worth it so far. However, if I were to do it over again and found a competitor with a similar product, I would definitely take a look."
142549,0,"I agree with other reviewers who indicate that the time window of 10 minutes is too short for the litter to clump hard enough, the pan is too shallow and the thing is a chore to clean when the time comes.However, it is a nice convenience to have when you live with two cats and don't want to spend your time monitoring the litter box. And, the cats seem to enjoy watching the rake go back and forth.Littermaid does have their own brand of litter which works better than any of the premium litters available. It has a funky smell but our cats don't seem to mind. The bags are small and a bit pricey. It is worth not having to clean muck off of the rake and it does track less. I have only found it stocked at Target so far.Unfortunately, I am hunting for a replacement since our old one stopped working AGAIN. The first time it was under warranty and they replaced it, but it is completely dead again after only 8 months of use. The motor most likely burned out as the power indicator [red light] is lit.Both of our cats are between 9 and 12 pounds each and the LM900 works well for them. I may go with the LM950 this time, though."
99349,2,"This is one of the best reviewed pet feeders that I could find, so we tried it out. It worked well for a while and then started rotating non-stop when the time to rotate hit. The problem is the catch under the food dish. It is supposed to pop up in between bowls so that it stops rotating and it apparently isn't catching anymore. Until it started doing this, it was working fine and was effective for feeding the cats once a day."

55357,1,"I bought two of these to help my two pudgy kitties slow down when eating in the hopes that they would not start begging for more food an hour later, and while the latter didn't really happen the former did! My 8 year old female likes to slowly push her food ball with her nose, while my two year old male bats the heck of it until it ricochets around the kitchen -- both get their kibble one or two pieces at a time.The only downside is that you have to designate a space to accommodate bits of cat kibble on the floor. I have a section of my kitchen enclosed by a few rolled up towels so that the balls stay in an area I know is clean and sanitary, and also to keep the balls from getting stuck along the baseboards. I wouldn't recommend this ball to be used on carpet due to the cleanliness factor.Easy to fill and to adjust the hole size, and very engaging for both my kitties (very different personalities). Would like to see more options for the hole sizes, since kibble comes in so many shapes these days, but it is a small issue.Highly recommended. Takes the cats 20 minutes to eat what used to take them 5 to 10. Great product."
78911,2,"I purchased this item for my border collie puppy who flees dogs and children. I need to train her to stay with me and to greet other dogs. She was able to wriggle out of her other harness.The Premier Easy Walk Harness solved the problem of letting me hold my puppy tight without hurting her or having her escape.HOWEVER>>> the harness lasted just days. Leaving it on my puppy, she was able to chew it when I was not paying attention. Less than 15 minutes of chewing ended the harness.The company has a replacement policy. $7.95. But you have to send it to them and wait for a replacement. Total cost $10. Wait time: 1+ weeks. I sent mine back, but now I am going to have to remove the harness when we are not out walking or when my dog is in the yard and I am not present.A better idea would be to use materials that are chew proof, like those used in the most excellent Lupine products.I give the product high marks for design; failing grades for materials.Would I purchase this product again? No.And I would advise anyone considering this product to keep in mind that it is perishable."
17500,1,"I was skeptical about this product, after reading other reviews stating that it overcorrected by responding to sneezing, sniffing, and other non-barking triggers. However, my overly-barky dogs were really getting out of hand, and I was desperate for a humane way to get a bit of peace and quiet. Thus, I purchased this product.First impression: holy cow, are these collars known for breaking loose and running free around the factory? It is very nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the packaging without slicing one's fingers to shreds on the sharp plastic! But all right, that doesn't actually have any bearing on the product, so moving on... I immediately removed the collar from the packaging, adjusted the fit, filled it with citronella, and strapped it on the barky-est of my dogs. Then, eager to get this new training under way, I rang the doorbell.BARK. -pfffft- BARK. -pffffft- BARK. -pfffffft- Silence. The dog went and curled up on her bed and was quiet.Hooray!!So, if you didn't get the point of that reenactment, the collar silenced my dog pretty quickly. She's not overly intelligent, so if she made the connection that quickly, I think any dog can.The downside to the collar: I have two dogs who feed off each other; when one barks, the other barks, and then the first one barks again, in a vicious cycle of endless barking. If one of these dogs is wearing the collar and the other dog barks, depending on how close to each other they are, the first dog's bark occasionally results in the collared dog getting sprayed whether the collared dog barked or not. The benefit of that is that, in my case, it leaves both dogs wary about whether it's safe to bark; the downside is that, obviously, the poor collared dog ends up being disciplined for a bark she didn't commit.Another note: my Jack Russell figured out pretty quickly that he only gets sprayed when he has the collar on. Thus, he barks (or doesn't bark) accordingly. However, he does seem to have learned some inhibition: he seems to stop and think about whether it's safe to bark any time he feels the urge to bark, and I'm quickly able to have a verbal intervention with him when I see him starting to respond to a barking trigger.So, the bottom line, I find this an excellent, humane tool to help curb out-of-control barking. It's definitely not a cure-all, because it depends on the reasons for your dog's barking--you may need to seek additional behavioral modification. But this did help my dogs learn to think twice before just letting loose with unnecessary barking, and the resulting peace in my house is highly worth the purchase price."
32445,2,My first drinkwell lasted over 5 years with no problems!! However #2 lasted 2 months and this latest #3 lasted one week before the motor stopped and couldn't be restarted!! In 5 years the company forgot how to put QUALITY in their product. I might as well have flushed over 60 dollars away from the luck I have had with the last 2 machines. I am going to try another brand.

I'm going to try Innova Evo when he gets a little older.
2027,1,"I purchased the cordless clipper after my last oster clipper showed up broken one day. This has been wonderful - it is much quieter, and the cordless part makes it so much more convenient for my older dog. He can just lay anywhere he wants, and I can track him down instead of forcing him to stay close to an outlet. For his convenience, this has been well worth the extra investment."

63339,1,"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating."
170440,0,"It killed my 3 goldfish from the fair but that might be because the weren't strong enough. It doesn't really keep the water clear, it will clean the leftover food and fish poo but the water went smelly after 2 weeks. Twice as long as without it. But the current it makes at swirls the water around so much the fish slams into the side, slides up to the top, goes down to the bottom, and sticks to the filter and dies. Even on low setting, I reccomend a coffee filter to solve both problems. Put a little piece ontop of the sponge and put it on it's highest setting. With that it will filter much better and not swirl the fish around.The bubbled thing you see at the top:It doesn't do anything really, there is no difference with or without it. If you want to make bubble like its supposed to, hook up an air pump with a gang valve. My bubbler is for big 50gal tank so even on the lovest setting it's too high, but if yours is smaller you might not need a gang valve."

He is not a chewer, but he did spend one stressed-out 4th of July clawing at the front mesh door for hours, and it held up fine. It's a good size for our dog - he can stand up and turn around easily. If he sprawls out when sleeping then he does bump up against the ends, because he's a long dog, but he doesn't seem cramped. It only takes about a minute for one person to set up, and is light enough for one person to carry easily. Folds down to less than 2"" thick. We use it as a bed for our dog when we travel."
184814,0,"i love the size of this product and that it's made out of durable plastic but i have mastiffs and each time i remove the bowls to refill food and water, there is 3 inches of water under each bowl that i have to sponge out...what a pain in the neck!!! not thrilled..."
65517,0,"I purchased this to use with my Labrador since I bought the 40+ lbs food bags. At the beginning everything was fine and working great. As they are a stand-type feeding place, it would be easier for my lab to eat out of them. The problem came when one day, I noticed ants crawling in it, when I opened the food container...OMG...ANTS EVERYWHERE! These smart little critters will FIND ANYTHING LIKE DOG FOOD IN A HEARTBEAT, and these containers are not TIGHT as to prevent insects from crawling into your dog's food. So keep this in mind if you are going to keep your dog feeder in a place like a garage or anywhere where insects might have a change to get to."
88326,0,"Was hoping my cats would flock to this but sadly they didn't. My youngest cat played for three minutes, drank once and that was that. Two days later I haven't seen any of my cats actually drink from this yet. Now I'm wondering if I shouldn't have just left the regular, easy to clean bowl down for them and saved myself the money and the time!As fountains go this looks nice, is easy to fill and is quiet. The running water sound is soothing.That being said this is just day two so I'm not sure how much trouble this will be to keep clean or if it will get noisy after a while. For now it's nice.However, if I don't notice my cats drinking more I may include a new filter and send this back!Bottom line is it's plastic with a pump and a filter. Shouldn't cost more than half of what it does here on Amazon and 1/3rd what it costs in retail stores. I don't think it's worth the money. No bang for lots of buck!"
40901,0,Bought this gate for my mom's living room for my daughter as it has an extra wide doorway. It works but it isn't as sturdy as those that have a bar that snaps in place. However since she only visits my mom once or twice a month it works for us.
45526,0,"I used this on my small golden retriever. She didn't like it and would try to get it off with her paws, but was much easier to control with it on. The reason I don't rate it highly is because I found the construction to be insufficient. The lead ripped completely and I had to sew it back together -- it should be made stronger for the price."
113863,0,"This fleece pet bed is well-made and gives my pet padded comfort. It fits perfectly in my cage.

My dog is so comfortable on it that he chooses to use it for daytime naps and for his overnight bed. It is also great when confining while training. It machine-washes and machine-dries well.My rating of 3 stars is based on my dog having clawed at the surface, causing some damage. - I wonder about its ability to stand up to this treatment.

32256,0,"Let me first say that the water fountain is probably really great. It was easy to set up and operate. The pump worked well, and was relatively quiet. I think my cats would have loved it. They were so curious and spent a lot of time around it. The disappointing part was that it leaked on the bottom near the motor. I disassembled it and reassembled it to try to tighten it up, but it still continued with a steady drip near the motor. I could not use it and had to return it. I will get another one, probably a model up - maybe the Platinum. Return was easy and postage paid."

53173,0,"I was rather surprised at the small size of this feeder - it's no bigger than a softball! There is a metal link already in the plastic hook, so I think they've corrected that past error I saw on some reviews. But be prepared for the small size! Also - the outlets for the birds to drink is small, built in, down low, no petal or other sign for them to find. I hope the birds can see where to go!"

I sent it back and already purchased another.

12977,1,Great Product! Fish absolutely love it!This product is great for use in the Eheim automatic feeder. It keeps me from wondering if I fed my fish.
12811,2,Had this cage since Dec. 2007. It's VERY hard to clean out. The only plus is that the doors lach good.
35142,0,"Ugh. They really need to put instructions on the thing. I hated this gate, I could never get it tight enough in a doorway for it to be any use at all. The slightest touch would topple it. But then I figured it out.What you need to do to get it tight in a doorway is to separate the two wooden bars where it says ""open close"". Pull on the metal clasp and pull the bars apart. Then put the gate in the doorway, put the metal bit that sits in the grooves into the groove you want, and push down the top bar like a big lever, snapping it to the lower bar. Finally, it is secure in the door!!!"

115825,0,"Like other reviewers, I was very happy when I received Mr. Herzher's Pet Residence. It looked great in place of the old wire crate I'd been using for my lab. Later the same day I crated her and ran a few errands. I was gone for about an hour. When I cam home, she had chewed a large hole in one of the side panels. This dog has not chewed anything else in my house (other than her toys), so I was really surprised. Although I found an online source for replacement panels, I've put the crate in storage for now. If your dog chews at all, this is a waste of money!"

Unfortunately, I only got about 6-8 hours of barking control before the citronella cartridge ran out and my dog felt free to bark all she wanted. This was usually when I was sleeping. So great idea...just a bigger cartridge and longer lasting product would be desired!"
84489,0,"I've used this product for several years now.Pros-- Easy maintenance- battery lasts, like FOREVER- Don't need to wake up at 5am to feed my cats OR worry about getting home late- Great when I travel! Cuts down on pet sitting expenses.Cons-- Portions are not exact; actually, it feeds a lot MORE than I program. 1/4 cup each meal is the smallest unit but the machine always feeds more like 1/3 cup. (Somehow this gets worse with smaller kibbles, so I've resorted to buying brands with larger kibbles) This defeats the purpose of ""portion control"".- Programming is very counter-intuitive; I always need to refer to the manual when I want to re-program the settings.- One of my cats figured out how to get more kibbles out of the machine; so definitely not cat-proof. again, defeats the purpose of ""portion control"".- No matter how often I reset the current time, the internal clock is always 5-10 minutes off.All in all, decent feeder for its price, but I'm saving up to get the Perfect Pet Feeder by Pillar Pets."

36553,1,"This product promotes itself as a fast cure for ich and other parasites, and from my experience it is a very effective treatment. I can't vouch for its claim to cure ich in two days in all cases, but it is a rather fast-working product.I like that this product is not as harsh a treatment as the wide-spectrum antibiotic preparations that people too often use for fish diseases. While it seems natural to reach for strong microbials when your fish are sick, it can stress out your fish even more, making things worse. QuICK Cure cures ich without resorting to antibiotics.As with all ich treatment regimes, this works better if you raise the aquarium temperatures and keep the hood lights off. That will help speed along the ich parasite's life cycle and keep your fish in a quiet healing state.Other caveats - you have to remove the carbon from your aquarium filters before adding the treatment drops, or it won't work at all.You will need to use the smaller recommended dose with tetras. Thin-skinned fishes, like the catfishes, botias and loaches must actually be removed, since the malachite green in the medication is too readily absorbed and becomes toxic to them.QuICK Cure comes in a small dropper squeezy container. A 4 oz bottle treats thousands of gallons, which is a lot of ich. In other words, this one product should last your lifetime! Remember not to over-treat; use only the amount recommended per gallon. This product will turn your water blue and will dye anything else it touches. Be careful not to let this stuff touch you too much, since formalin is a cancer-causing agent.If you have a big ich infestation, I recommend using this medication. Make sure to use it correctly, of course! For a small ich outbreak, you might want to just try high temps, no lights and massive water changes first."
145584,1,Sometimes the fasteners vibrate loose & get lost. The pet stores don't carry replacements. These worked great as replacements & were the perfect length for the dog crate.Quick shipping too!
192539,0,"I bought this ball for my dog thinking it would be the solution to her intense chewing but it wasn't. In all fairness the treats are very dense so she didn't gobble it up immediately, but it didn't last over 20 minutes. I put one of the treats in and she immediately grabbed the end that sticks out and pulled it out and began to eat the treat within 5-10 minutes. I think the treats should be more low-profile so they can't just be pulled out like a human would. Also, with just one treat in my dog figured out she could just stick her snout in the opposite end the the treat would pop out the other side again. I took the treat away when it got flat like a disk and stuck it in the middle compartment (where you're supposed to put tiny treats) and she got that out too.SUMMARY: 3 stars because the treats are dense and using tiny treats in the middle alone might make the toy more functional, but the big treats are too expensive and weren't difficult enough to entertain my dog for longer than a rawhide."
2299,0,"My dog destroys all chew/dog toys pretty much so it was nice to see that this ball wasn't destroyed. However, he doesn't care for it as much as the Everlasting Treat Ball. This ball has much less bounce and it is heavy. It also becomes slippery when slobbery unlike some other balls. Use it outdoors!"
78591,0,"first time i've used this on my 4yr old dog, maybe thats the reason why he walks funny when i put this on him. The sizing is not correct as well. I chose medium (my dog has 22 size) but its way too big for him. i like the design though, maybe if used on a larger dog, this works better."
103468,0,"This one was eaten, but not happily. They like salmon, but the greens thing in these florentines just don't tempt their appetites whatsoever. They do look like real people food when you open the can, however. They don't smell up your kitchen like most cat food does and honestly, the nutritional content of these varieties makes all of them worth a try. If you cat loves salmon, by all means try this one if nothing else, because of the nutritional value. But if they're so-so, you may opt for a less expensive variety. I do recommend these varieties very highly, however, because of their nutritional content, but we prefer the egg souffles in this house! :)"
202608,1,"I have a short haired Belgian Malinois Shepard, who sheds all year long a bit but about 3-4 times a year he just blows his coat. This tool is great, really gets the undercoat. and must feel good to the dog, like getting one's back scratched since he is so cooperative for it. the price from Amazon was amazing,and really don't need the fur releasing technology since the fur comes right off and unlike a slicker brush doesn""t prick the human's skin."
52067,2,This toy lasted about two weeks. My year old Vizsla had the cover half off in a week. It is difficult to throw very far.

143037,0,"While the litter box does work as advertised, there is one small problem. The lid for the disposable tray does not want to close - almost every time we check the box, the lid is standing at least partially open. It doesn't affect the working of the box and, since the box is not in an area of the house that is open, it's not offensive. However, for the price, I'd expect the lid to close. I've been using various Littermaid boxes for the past 6 years or so and the first model is still the best, as far as I'm concerned."
142086,1,These do not shed easily. I always vacuum the cat beds before use. They wash very nicely. The edges are firm and bulky for them to rest their heads and prop their bodies over the edge. My cats have claws and these stand up to the abuse. :-)
75913,1,This is exactly what I needed. I was having a hard time finding it at a pet shop. It was a great price and makes my aquarium look great.
197127,2,"My first automatic water dish was a Petmate Fresh Flow. It worked well but died after a couple of years so I replaced it with the Catit. The Catit was more expensive but looked neat and I figured my cat would be able to have a larger service area to get the running water.This was a huge mistake. My cat could careless about the water running over the outside of the globe even though he loves to drink from the sink So much surface area causes my bowl to run out of water inside of 5 days.Next, there is a approx. a 2 inch height difference from the fountain bowl to the drinking bowl. I think it's here to help the filtering process. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. I still get a ton of gunk clogging up the cheap pump. One little thing and the pump won't put the water over the fountain. I have to clean this weekly which is quite the process. Because the drinking bowel is at a higher level then the fountain bowel there is always water left standing in the fountain bowel several inches deep but nothing in the drinking bowl.And this in nothing about cleaning the water resevior at all. It looks cool but really that's all that is great about it. Great concept but terrible in actuality. Filter is higher quality then other water fountains but does not seem to work all that great. The plastic over the cord in the back makes putting a full cat fountain down near impossible without spilling it.My fountain pump died in less then a year. Trying to currently find another pump from a fish store but am not sure I desire to do so. I don't recommend this product."
18193,0,"I was eagerly awaiting delivery of this product after I read mostly excellent reviews. It arrived today and the top tier platform is crooked.... angled at about 15 degrees. It appears to have been made that way, not damaged in delivery.This detracts from it's appearance and it remains to be seen whether my cats will accept it."
149983,0,"I've just tried this product on a 3-gal. tank with 3 goldfish, leaving them for 10 days with one tablet.The good news: the fish are alive (I guess, that's what matters most). The not so good one: pretty much all surfaces of the aquarium, including the plants and the innards of the pump have been covered with rather sticky white goo which wouldn't wash off on its own without actively brushing it off. A bit of a nuisance, requiring a thorough clean-up. Next time, I am going to try an automatic feeder likeEHEIM Everyday Fish Feeder Programmable Automatic Food Dispenserbut it's still good to have a couple of these tablets in case of an emergency."
201394,2,"If someone had written my review before I purchased this item, I would NEVER have bought this weapon. And the other negative reviews are spot on. It cuts hair that's the bottom line. And here's a very simple way you can see this for yourself. Take this tool and run it on your own hair.When I first used the furminator on my cat, I thought it was absolutely amazing, but I too was fooled like everyone else. Large amounts of hair come off in a very clean collected way. But when I used the tool near the base of my cats tail, the furminator made a sound exactly like a razor when you shave your legs, etc. So now I really started wondering what was going on?? Was it pulling the loose hair or cutting hairs? First I closely examined the hair that had collected on the furminator head. I couldn't tell if they were broken or pulled. Then I thought, omg, my own hair. So i used it on my own hair. To my great horror I saw little pieces of my own hair drop onto my counter, WTH!!!! And again it made a very clear cutting razor like sound on my hair too. Yes, this tool cuts hair! In the furminator's defense all I can say is that only about half of my hair were cut, and the hair that were pulled out were loose already i suppose because I didn't feel any of my hair being pulled. So there's your answer. Does it pull out the loose hair or cut it? Both. This is not a hair removal tool, this is a hair cutting weapon. It has no place in your pets grooming unless you are deliberately trying to cut your pets hair in no particular shape or amount."
87929,1,"This is the first fountain I'd bought, but our 17 year-old cat kept making a mess in the old water dish by pawing at the water with her front paws. While this was cute, it made a mess.Got the fountain, she immediately abandoned the old water dish and now drinks much more water (good!) and doesn't splash in the water at all, just drinks right where the water flows out.She loves it so much - yelling and following me around the whole time I refill or clean it until it is back.The reservoir can be removed with water still in it without spilling water.Yeah, you might spill a little when putting it back, but it is okay with me.It is pricey, but highly recommended if you really love your cat!"
198341,2,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Much to my surprise i received only one bone. the item weight is 36.2lbs and the original pricing is $103.2. when i called the company the gave me the run around for 3 days before i threatened to file a claim. within 5 min a manager called me back and said it was falsely marked and she would refund my money. when i told her i do not want my money back i want the correct items i had ordered. she said she was not willing to take the loss. This company does NOT hold to its word or advertising.... they tried about 10 different excuses to appease me. i will be reporting them to the BBB.

It contains many of the same ingredients you would find in a very good salon product for humans, but nothing special that will help with the shedding problem. So 3 stars for being a good conditioning product, but I held back 2 more stars, because it won't affect the amount of hair that comes off my dog."

143226,2,"I'ved owned an earlier Littermaid LM900 that was purchased back in 2004 and I've been very happy with it through all these years. Recently, I decided to buy another LM900 because my old one was getting worn out and the gears were starting to jump the tracks when the load was heavy. Unfortunately, the new one did work when I plugged it in. The light came on but the rake would simply not move. I had already disposed of the packaging so to return it might pose a problem.Fortunately, being somewhat of an electronics hobbyist I managed to figure out that the circuit board was defective. After about an hour with a soldering iron I managed to swap out the bad circuit board with the good one from my old LM900. Everything works fine now. Nevertheless, I was very unhappy with this experience. The quality of the new one was definitely not as good as the old one. For instance, the old version made use of 2 pairs of good quality switches to detect the rake position whereas the new one only used 1 pair of cheap switches. Although I had loved it in the past, I would no longer recommend this product."
153340,1,"I've had 2 of these auto feeders for over 3 months now, and this is exactly what I needed, for my two cats. I set it before I leave for work with some dry food in it, and if I get home late, they're fed for the night! I also have a water fountain feeder for them, so they're all set in case I'm late for dinner! I did not buy the cold pack accessory, but I'm thinking of trying it to use wet food with it. It takes AA batteries, and you can set it for anytime over a 24 hour period. My one cat is pretty clever, and tries to break into it when he hears me pour his dry food into it. The first few times I set it, I noticed his attempts, and stopped him. I have yet to come home to a disassembled unit :)I would recommend that you try it out, and for the first time you set it, be home when it is set to open to make sure that you're cat doesn't break into it, and that it does in fact open. I havent had any problems with mine. In fact, it is very easy to clean as well, the white tray comes out for easy cleaning, and replacement. The only problem is that when they are not in use, you cannot close the lid without setting the time, and if you have batteries in it, that means it will pop open when the time is up. I don't close the lids when in storage, but this could be a problem for people with limited storage space."
206065,1,"I have had this Port-a-crate for two years. I use it for my (fairly large) cat. I have been on several road trips with the cat and have had no problems with it at all. I like that the top opens to give me access to the cat if she hides in the back of the crate. The cat sometimes sleeps in the crate when we are not on the road. On occasion, the cat flips out and claws the crate when she doesn't want to be penned up inside, and the crate shows no signs of damage. I really like this product, and I am placing an order for another one to house my other cats."
188354,0,"When my dog died the hospital made up one of these for me. I decided to make them for my other two dogs. I had one that was given to me some time ago and I hadn't made up. And I bought a new one. They were entirely different experiences. The old one was a sticky gooey mess and probably won't set. The new one was easy to use and I think it will be fine. So perhaps they have changed the product or maybe age causes changes to the material and those who found them sticky were using old kits. If the one doesn't work, I will be buying another to try again."
5393,0,"Although I've only been using this product on my dog for a little over a month, it does appear to help. However, my dog is picky and doesn't really care for the taste and smell of the product. I've had to come up with a couple of different ways to disguise the product in the food. So I guess it really depends on the animal and whether or not your willing to spend a little more time making sure that your dog will eat it."
196426,1,"I received the six gallon tank as a gift because I was looking to add a pet to my bedroom. The setup is generally easy and only takes maybe five minutes. I purchased three small fish the next day and had some great results. Over time I added a few more and now the aquarium is just thriving! It's great because the tank is so small and can fit almost anywhere. You just need to be careful not to overcrowd the fish. Your list of fish possibilities are small, but they'll look amazing under the flourescent lighting. The only inconvenience of the set is the top opening. When the lid is open, the filter is right there, and the hole that leads into the water is suprisingly small. Plus, I can't clean the tank without having to take the entire top off and drip water all over the floor. But, there are definitely more advantages to it. Just remember to clean the tank once a month, check the maintenance of the filter, and not overcrowd the tank (add about one inch of fish per every gallon), and you'll have some happy fish for years."

73830,0,"I gave this stuff a shot, I really did.I recently hand reared 4 kittens. Once they were about four-five weeks old, I decided to give weaning a shot.Every feeding session I put this down for the kittens to eat. Every time, they ignored it and waited for milk.I ended up getting Royal Canin (tiny hard food pellets) for them to see if that made a difference. Instantly two of them dived in and were weaned on the spot.The last one took another week to wean, but would only do so on wet food (from pouches) mixed with formula. Then after five days or so she was ready for the Royal Canin.I gave it three stars, however, because it really is reasonably priced, and I could see how cats would appreciate the consistency and meaty flavor. Mine didn't.WARNING: Two of the kittens in the litter were long haired. They got this food all over their fur as I was trying to get them to eat it and it was terrible to get out. I ended up having to use a toothbrush, which took off some of their fur. For furry kittens, use at your own risk."

In any case, my wife's cat triggered the sensor about 25% of the time. I set up the deterrent for sound only as to not subject the cat to needless blasts of air. No animal or human was harmed during this experiment. Despite other reviewer complaints regarding the inconsistent motion trigger, I was hopeful when I placed my order. Unfortunately, I must add my review to the pile of the unsatisfied.An even greater disappointment is amazon's current denial of my return for this product, despite the manufacture's return policy included in the box that states I can get a refund. Apparently, there is an issue with returning ""hazardous"" or ""flammable"" material, although amazon's own product description would lead you to believe that Contech StayAway Pet Deterrent is safe. Caveat emptor! You may not be able to return this product even if you are unsatisfied because of reasonable objections. I'll provide an update after amazon reviews my appeal."

23932,0,"I started off with a Tetra Whisper filter for a 10 gallon tank when my turtles were babies. When I upgraded them to a bigger tank, I needed something with more capacity. Since my first Tetra filter worked well, I was open to getting another one of the same brand especially after finding out the Whisper BioBags cartridges will also work in this unit- sweet! The only down side is when using the BioBags cartridges in this compare to my previous water filter, it seems to get clog quicker (despite this taking two vs. one in my previous tank). I was a bit disappointed that I might have to change the filter more often- previously, I changed it once every 3-4 weeks, with this my water got murky after a week or so. That will be going through 1 cartridge every month vs. 4 every month with this water filter. After reading some of the other reviews and different forums, I took the advice of removing the filter cartridges and spraying them with water to get most of the gunk off. This actually works! I take them out to clean about once a week, and change the entire cartridge (carbon and all) as recommended (once a month). This keeps my water clean. I also do a 25% water change with a siphon to get gunk out of the gravel- turles are messy!This unit basically its a tall as my tank (I have a 20? gallon long tank). The turtles like climbing on this and have used it to climb over the edge of the tank. Since then, I have also install a lid which defeats the purpose of using the top part as a basking dock (there is only half inch of clearance). I might just have to get a taller tank- or get started on my extension project really soon."

59431,0,"Frontline worked fine for a while. But fleas are like viruses. If everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it. This summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the Frontline no longer worked for them. Unfortunately, it was true of my dog as well. She is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment. If this happens to you I recommend using a cheap Nitenpyram pill. You can get them on Amazon. One pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog, but it only lasts a day. But it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun. Lets hope you never get the Super Fleas!"
16485,1,"Works as advertised. We put it on the dog before going to work and remove when we are home. We have had our dog since she was a pup about 5 years. She never did anything like this until my wife returned to working full-time about a year ago. Other than removing everything we couldn't keep her from getting in the trash. And she has broken may glass things getting on the kitchen counter. She would never do it while we were home so it was hard to discipline her although we tried. This has saved her from being banished to a leash or even worse. Would recommended to all if you have similar issues. The shock isn't to bad for her, it just makes her jerk back. Its better than cutting a paw on broken glass."

5752,2,"I was very excited when this product arrived. I read the reviews and even got suggestions from other pet owners that this was the best thing for tear stains. I have a 12lbs Pomeranian mix that has some pretty dark tear stains and he didn't care for me putting things near or in his eyes. I also tried changing his food to a healthier version and that didn't work. I figured that this would be a nice alternative.First issue: My dog isn't a finicky eater at all. However, when I put the recommended amount in his food, he could smell it and wouldn't go near any piece that had it on it. I tried reducing the amount. The resulted in him tipping his bowl over trying to ""dust"" the food off (I guess). I tried mixing it in other foods. That didn't work. Anyway, after a while, he figured out that it wasn't going anywhere so he started eating it. I was still very slowly trying to work up to the recommended dose for his weight. But he was VERY hesitant to eat his food because he didn't seem to like it at all. I wanted to make sure he was still eating.Second Issue: After he started eating the food with the Angel Eyes, the consistency of his feces became much softer. He also was become more and more dehydrated.Last issue: He started vomiting up his food. Mind you he already wasn't eating that much but the sheer quantity of it was frightening. I know this is inevitable with dogs at times. However, this has never happened to him before where he vomited so much. I could tell he was upset. I am also upset that I gave this to him in the first place.While I very glad that it works for others, I'm very sad that I paid money to make my dog sick.I hope others interested have MUCH more luck than we did."
67027,2,"I would have given these a 5 star rating, except for the fact that I had to cut off 60 TAGS - EVERY MOUSE HAD A PLASTIC TAG ATTACHED TO IT WHICH I HAD TO CUT OFF.... very tedious and time consuming and I did not want to leave them on. Might I suggest to the company Zanies, when you are selling these 60 to a box, please sell them without individual tags!The photo should have shown them with all the tags. Very misleading. I would have returned them if I hadnt already cut some of the tags off.The other problem is when cutting the cat tags off, if the tag isnt cut close enough to the toy it leaves a very sharp point that could hurt the cat!To the manufacturer, please stop putting tags directly on these toys, they are not safe."

90953,0,"Bought this bed for my 125 lb dog because he sleeps a lot and I wanted him off the ground. He loves it and it is big enough in area for him, but it has stretched and sagged so much that he now hits the ground. I got some canvas thread and stitched up all the sides to make it tight again. This worked for a while. Now the fabric has holes in it from his toe nails I think. I need to replace the cover. I had no problems assembling the bed, but I do need to tighten the bolts at least once a week. The biggest problem was the stretching of the fabric. It stretched so much that the entire bed came apart one time. I am hesitant to purchase another fabric, and go through all the stretching again."

91634,0,"I bought this hoping my cats would like it. Summers are very hot here, and when the house is in the 80's-90's, they lay around looking like road-kill (so do the people, but that's a subject for another product review!). But the cats wouldn't use it. Not at all. If I put them on it, they immediately jumped down. If I put it in a pathway to try to make them walk on it so they'd get used to the feel of the fabric under their feet, they would crawl UNDER it or jump over it rather than walk across it. This summer I lent it to a friend whose house is always in the 90's in the summer and whose 9 cats normally will climb all over anything new, and even her cats wouldn't use it. The fabric is very rough and scratchy, and I'm guessing that it's painful to the pads of their paws (just a guess--anyone out there who channels cats may be able to find out for sure!). Otherwise, the product is sturdy and appears well-made. Definitely hard to assemble and the reviews that give tips for assembly were very helpful--thank you! In terms of size, I really wasn't sure what size to get. It turns out the small size was plenty big even for my friend's extremely large cat--lots of room to spare. Bottom line, it's a gamble--if your pet(s) will use it, it's a great product! But if they won't, you've wasted a not-insignificant chunk of money. So only 3 stars because, though well-made, it's potentially a waste of money and there's no way to know unless you try it. Tip: They do sometimes lie under it! So now that it's winter, I might drape a blanket over it to make them a cave, just so I can get some benefit from the money I spent!"

She has chewed off all four corners of this toy, but not enough for the squeakers to fall out or for the toy to lose its puffiness. Although the corners have been chewed through, the squeakers are still intact, functioning and in place.She has probably had this toy for almost a year now, and it is still her favorite toy.If she ever gets through the rest of it, I will definitely pick up another one."
77357,2,I have ordered this playpen 2 times and both deliveries came with missing parts. There were absolutely no instructions or hardware to assemble the pen door. I attempted to call the manufacturer to obtain the necessary hardware but was never able to reach a person. I left 2 voicemails and have yet to receive a return call. I then returned the item to Amazon and a replacement was sent very quickly. The problem was the 2nd delivery arrived the very same way - no hardware! Amazon is quality checking the items now. I do like the playpen but am very disappointed with the lack of customer service from the manufacturer. Hopefully I'll be able to receive the item with all necessary parts to assemble it.
203123,0,"I wish I could explain it, but the tool works like a champ. Not only did it remove a lot of undercoat without much effort (and even teased out slightly matted hair with a bit of work) but both dogs put up with it MUCH better than with any other method so far; one of them even went so far as to lie down to be groomed, which he NEVER does. In over ten years of owning these guys, they've never looked better with less effort. In short: I don't want to like it, because I don't want to admit I paid so much for a glorified comb, but it works like a champ. Highly recommended. Two labs here, and we've tried a number of things--ZoomGrooms, combs, brushes, undercoat rakes, those groovy serrated flexible metal things... none worked particularly well, and the dogs lost interest and patience very quickly. Then our vet-tech recommended the furminator. I was very resistant, not necessarily for the price but just because I couldn't believe it was that much different."

Well there was maybe 1 tsp. of filler in the entire bone. Of course a product never looks exactly like the picture, but to not be filled hardly at all? I will be contacting the company directly and will repost or remove my rating if they honor their company. I will be asking for a new one! I should have taken video of what I received and checked it over more throughly. I'll let you know the outcome!"

157557,0,"For the most part I like this pet door and think it works well. However, it has one tragic flaw which I had to remedy myself. The problem is in the flap - it doesn't weigh enough at the bottom to shut if a breeze is blowing by. I had to attach a small steel plate toward the bottom of the flap in order to weigh it down enough to shut every time. I suppose if you install this pet door inside an interior room door, or through an attached garage to house door it wouldn't have a breezy flap issue. Otherwise, be aware of this potential problem. Installation is very straight-forward. I chose to install it on my storm door. Just be sure to make your measurements twice so you don't make any cutting mistakes. Remember, you've only got one shot at making a proper cut!If you're worried whether or not your dog will use a doggy door, rest assured he or she most likely will. I have a Shiba Inu (They are well known for being stubborn), so it took several days of holding treats on the other side while partially pushing open the door flap before he finally started walking through it by himself. At first it seemed hopeless, but if he can figure it out, I'm fairly confident most other dogs will too."

92412,1,we already had one of these toys for our cat. he'd managed to shred half the fabric off the toy so I bought 2 as backups. the price was great. 4 dollars compared to paying 7 or more at the big name pet store in town.

88296,2,The Drinkwell Fountain in operation is quiet in operation and our cats did drink from it. But over the long haul the design made cleaning impossible.

We went with the stainless steel Pioneer Pet Fountain and with it round design with no sharp corners cleaning is piece of cake and it has no dishwasher restrictions.

Who knew.I dug an old 10 gallon fish tank out of the garba... umm... I mean garage and we ordered this to top it off. Sure enough, her rat.. umm... I mean hamster seemed to have great fun enjoying his captivity. He scampered up and down the ramps and ran seemingly endlessly for hours on his squeaky wheel (usually in the dead of the night, when I was trying to sleep) to announce his sheer joy at such a marvelous domicile!The quality of the topper is somewhat questionable however, since the clever little fellow managed to find a spot where the wires were not quite solidly fused together, allowing him to shove them aside and escape for a few days, until I spotted him sightseeing along the floor beneath the kitchen cabinets. A bit of wire to reattach the broken area and he was back safely home.Lots of fun for your little pet, just be sure to check the spot welds or be prepared to go on a hunt for your little fugitive."

41540,0,"After reading about the ""self-heating"" pad, I looked at this item at the store and realized that the magic crinkly noise coming from inside the pad was just mylar sheeting, the same stuff a $2 emergency blanket is made of. It reflects nearly 90% of body heat. As I already have a regular cat pad lying around and didn't want to buy another (especially if the mylar interior goes into the wash with the pad) I just cut a square of mylar from the emergency blanket and inserted it into a fleece pillow case to see if my kitten would like laying on a crinkly pad. He enjoys the mylar sound, but also liked attacking the sheeting before I could get it inside the case. It definitely keeps him warm. I can feel the heat under his belly when he's been lying there for a while, plus I've selfishly sat on it and reaped the benefits myself. I don't think I'll open up my cat pad to insert the mylar, as it just seems better to be able to remove the sheeting when I want to give the pad or case a washing. The key is to have the mylar closest in layer to the cat's body, just below a thin soft fabric. The reflective heat is noticeable that much more quickly. So inserting it inside a dense pad doesn't seem as useful. I may place the mylar on top of the cat pad, and just add a fleece cover or the pillowcase.The cost of the product itself is fine, if I didn't already have a cat pad lying around. And while the product does work, I don't like the idea of washing the pad with mylar inside, Seems like the aluminized coating will crinkle and wear off with each rigorous washing cycle, lessening it's effectiveness over time."

36682,0,"I bought this item for my golden retriever. A trainer had recommended that I try feeding her meals this way so that she wouldn't just inhale her food. I typically feed her 1 cup of kibble, and the capacity of this seemed to be about 1/2 that. I filled it full, showed her how it worked, and set it down. She did seem to enjoy the challenge (or at least the food coming out), but after the first couple of minutes, the amount of food that came out at once (1-2 little kibble) decreased significantly even though there was still lots of food inside. After 15 minutes, I lost patience with the toy, and attempted to shake out the rest of the food. It took me a few minutes, which means that it would have taken her another 15 or so. I had particular trouble getting out the last 2-3 pieces. This could be a great toy for dogs, but it certainly is not a good tool for meal feeding. Plus, since she was rolling it everywhere, I had slobber and dog food crumbs everywhere when she was done. Yuck!"
127765,2,"This is a cute, soft, cuddy toy which will, no doubt, entertain dogs without much interest in chewing (or lack the teeth to do so). However, our sweet little miniature dachshund (A) removed all three ""squirrels"" (they're really chipmunks and very cute) within less than 5 seconds the first time out of the box. Game over. Tree stump irrelevant. Within 15 minutes the three luckless chipmunks were in need of major surgery. Sadly, they are all deceased. The squeakers, like those in almost every dog toy of this type, are cheap, poorly inserted, and inadequately protected from anything but a toothless animal. The seams holding these cuties together are easily ripped open, spilling little chipmunk guts all over the carpet and leaving the ""squeaker"" for your pet to pick up and choke on! If this toy was for children, it would require a danger warning label. All-in-all it looks cute, but unless your dog is toothless and passive, look for another, better made toy. Amazon is doing no one, including the toy maker, any favors by including this poorly made item under the heading ""for aggressive chewers."" It is most definitely not! There's a reason the price is so low."

My 2 yr old (50 lb) shepherd was able to push the tray halfway out of the crate within 15 minutes. She was then able to move the entire crate around by pushing on the tray. She was also able to chew off some of the corners of the tray. Today she pushed the tray halfway out & managed to break it into sharp pieces. Luckily she did not hurt herself doing so. We had thought about using zip ties to further secure the tray but did not have a chance.I removed the bottom tray entirely & she seems to be doing okay in the crate now. For dogs that are being crate trained, this is not a good crate to start with. Maybe if she did not have separation anxiety & want to get out of it - it would be fine."

109425,0,"With my dog, it is inevitable that she will destroy everything I get for her, it is only a matter of time!What is great about these balls is that the fuzz on them is non-abrasive on your dog's teeth like a normal tennis ball is. My dog loves these balls because they squeak- which is part of their weakness. The squeakers are always the first thing to go, usually in the first day or two. Once the squeaker is gone, it is really up to my dog on how long she wants it to last. Sometimes she will let the ball survive because she wants to play keep away and catch with it, other times, she immediately goes into destroy mode. With the squeaker gone, she has a starting point to tear the fuzz and rip apart the rubber of the ball. Eventually, I end up with half a ball and a bunch of fuzz and rubber on the floor.I will saw that at least the squeaker usually falls into the ball, rather than out, keeping it out of her mouth, since that is something she would love to eat.While this can't be a forever toy, these are a nice treat for my dog!"
153421,0,"Although my Vet say's Zentonil is the only product she is aware of to treat canine liver problems there are several problems in administering the medication.My dog ""Lady"" is a 101 lb Spinonie Italiano (Italin Retriver)She requires 800 mg or (2) 400 mg pills each dayThe lable states that the pills must be taken on an empty stomach 3 to 4 hours before or after meals so that the pills will pass to the intestine before desolving.THE PROBLEM IS:The pills are quite LargeThe pills are enteric coated to prevent their desolving too soon and the coating makes the pills very Slippery.Athough that is a plus in getting the animal to swallow them it also makes it easy for the animal to Cough them Back Up.Over a period of about 2 months the only way I could get her to accept the pills was to wrap them in a piece of lunchmeat( I know that wasn't recomended because it stimulated her stomach acids)At one point she Chewed a pill (which must not taste good)Now, she absolutely refuses to accept the pills any way, shape, or form.In a few instances even when I was able to get her to the swalow the pills and keep them down down for several minutes, she actually threw upand ejected the pills.Is anyone else having this problem or know how I can get her to take them?ThanksROCKY4260@aol.com"

17114,2,Very unhappy. The collar works when I blow hard in it but put it on the dog and doesn't even work. And what's worse is that I cannot return it once it is used. How are you going to know about a product unless you use it. Most companies accept returns so I didn't think to read the return policy. They have a 15% re-stocking fee! Ridiculous! I learned my lesson. I will always read the return policy!
176396,1,My vet told me about Lupine products as my dog is a chewer due to jaw issues. This is my second purchase as I had to send my first back for replacement(did not want to be without harness or leash while other was being replaced) No problems with replacement. Took less than 2 weeks for replacement. I would recommend this to anyone who has a chewer.

84825,0,This feeder saved me from early morning attacks by my cat wanting to be fed. But I soon realized that my cat was eating three meals per day as programmed plus whenever she felt like sticking her paw inside and grabbing a snack. This product would be perfect if it closed off the food completely. Why have they not fixed this? It may work better for a dog with large paws that do not fit in the opening.
25045,0,"I'm of mixed feelings on this product. My dog really likes these rawhide bones and will munch on one readily, but I noticed that they are marked as &#34;Made in China&#34; on the back of the package. It could very well be that they have quality control in place to ensure these bones are safe for pets, but I've heard too many horror stories about this sort of thing to feel entirely comfortable.It's up to you as the purchaser to decide if you want to bother. My Keeshond-mix would heartily recommend these treats, but she doesn't know where China is."
111409,2,"I too wanted my cats to have silica dust free litter, so I switched to this brand. While it may be silica dust free it is NOT dust free. It is full of corn dust, and I recently found out from a veterinarian that corn is an allergen that can cause chronic urinary tract/bladder inflammation. Guess what? My cat has chronic UTI with no known source... Also this litter does not last the amount of time that they claim. My cats track this dust all over the house and on our clothes if we are holding them(gross!)and it has no odor control. One of my cats eats some of it and then throws it up. After several years of using this I am at the end of my rope. Not only is this NOT the Worlds Best Cat Litter, if your cat is allergic to corn it may be harming them, and it is expensive. I recently switched over to Dr. Elsey's cat litter. I am very happy with it. It clumps well, no dust, some odor control, and far cheaper."

115945,0,"Although it is listed under a dog toy, I can see why it did not work out as planned for some people. My daughter had this as a 4-year old and it was a lot of fun for her to watch bounce around all by itself and try to catch it. It might be appropriate for smaller dogs who do not chew, it will not be durable enough for dogs who like to catch it and chew."
147703,1,"The cats LOVE this toy. When it's put away after playtime, they will search the house looking for it. They've found it a couple of times, so we had to hide it better. What more would you want from a cat toy?"

149665,0,"Not really a fault of the product, but this won't really help if you have a flea problem. I caught tens of dozens of fleas with this, but when they number in the thousands, it's ineffective. Vectra (non-poisonous, unlike Frontline/Advantage) is what you really need."
143719,0,"I've had 2 of these over the past 10 years and each one still works great, the only issue is that over time the impeller shaft starts to wear causing grinding sounds. It's actually cheaper to just buy a new one, which solves the problem for another five years or so. So again, my filter started making sounds again, no problem, I went online, ordered the product and fired it up. I was shocked that the brand new filter literally right of of the shrink-wrap started making MORE of a grinding noise than the other two! It has been my conclusion that Hagen's (the manufacturer of Aquaclear products) quality has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased over the years. I am just going to return it, get my $50 back and deal with the noise. Please, don't get me wrong, these filters are absolutely amazing. they're one of the best, but a word to Hagen: don't let your quality standards lower or otherwise you'll lose your customer base and reputation."
131246,0,"Based on my dogs preference for these bones, there may be some variability in the quality. I can offer them one of the bones and they will refuse it, but if I offer a different one sometimes they will take that one.

144218,0,I bought this for when we go camping. We have a 30 pound mutt and a 50 pound German Shepard mix. The cage is really tall which I like but it is not very sturdy on its own. With 1 dog in it the cage was knocked over within about 2 minutes. We ended up having to make it a rectangle and stick it between two picnic tables and bungy cord it down. I think it could be better with stakes but we haven't tried that yet so I will have to update after the next camping trip.

109292,0,"To start, all the people that are upset that their dog chewed the balls up should realize these are meant to be fetched and not chewed. Fetching is what I bought them for and they work for that just fine. Although, the squeaker doesn't last long at all. The first ball had the squeaker last about 30 throws. I have a Miniature Schnoodle that's lucky to fit the ball in her mouth let alone chew it so now having no squeak is disappointing but for the price I don't feel it's worth the effort to return. I'd buy them again just to get the smaller ball and not pay twice as much at a local store."

187507,2,"As much as I like the feel, materials, concept and quality behind this product, it is the SECOND time I've ordered from Amazon and gotten a GREEN toy. I don't know what other folks' lawn color is, but mine is GREEN. The last one we bought blended in perfectly and lasted about 2 weeks before my husband shredded it with his tractor mowing the lawn. As annoyed as I was at him (so were our kids and our dog, who really liked it), I agreed with his retort: why would you get the dog a green throw toy for outside, anyway?PLEASE LET US PICK THE COLOR when ordering... It might last longer and encourage me to buy more. I didn't think that lightening would strike twice on getting a green toy, but it certainly did. I won't be buying a replacement when this (inevitably) gets lost or shredded in the yard this Spring/Summer. What a shame, as it is a durable dog toy."

I would rate this right up there with the cheapest cat litter you can buy at some place like Walmart, in terms of dust! I'm returning this tomorrow as it is the dustiest litter I've ever had the misfortune of inhaling. One would *think* that a crystal litter would be relatively dust-free, right? Not so. I actually have to cordon off the room where my cat usually has his box until I can get an air purifier with a HEPA filter because there is no way I'm going to allow him in there to have an asthma attack. *I'm* sick right now and feel like I have dust in my teeth and up my nose!FAIL.I will stick with the regular Dr. Elsie's Precious Cat clay litter as it seems to be relatively dust-free!Ain't nobody got time for that!"

173219,2,"My dog doesn't like being in a kennel while in the car, so I bought this harness for her safety. When I first received the product my dog had no trouble putting it on; it fit okay and it didn't seem to bother her. I only use it while in the car with her (which is not very often) but one of the straps has already begun to tear. It's already ripped about halfway and I don't expect that it would last much longer. I am really disappointed because I use it sparingly, and don't even remember using it more than 6 times or so. Anyway, I've contacted the company to see if their warranty covers the damage and will update with their response.Update:Took a while, but I finally got a new one after a little over a month."

121222,2,"I purchased the StarMark Collar after reading about it in the puppy book by the Monks of New Skete. It made no difference to our golden retriever puppy; she pulled on the leash as much with the StarMark Collar as with a traditional collar. My wife had a hard time fastening it at first; it took her about a week-and-a-half to get used to putting it on. The collar popped apart 3 times when I was walking our pup; twice was when the pup was confronted by hostile dogs, and the situation could have gotten ugly; the other time it popped apart was when she was playing in the park.I talked with Martina Contreras, a dog behaviorist, about the problem. She recommended the Premier Easy Walk Dog Harness (Amazon product number B0009ZBKG4). It instantly and dramatically reduced the amount and force of pulling on the leash. When we first got the Premier Harness, our dog did not like it, but after two days, when we say ""walk,"" she runs to the harness and sits for us to put it on. We did not train her to do this; she just likes the harness.I threw the StarMark Collar in the trash."

Only it was so tight I couldn't get my fingers out. Within 30 seconds my fingertips were blue/purple and I was screaming.

63696,2,"Bought this leash out of desperation, couldn't find the Flexi brand that I had for my other dog. Before one month was up, it stopped retracting unless I slapped it a few times. The spring was weak and pretty ineffective from the beginning. Very expensive and if extended to the limit, it is nearly impossible to retract. Has resulted in my dog coming close to getting into bad situations since I can't control the dog properly once the leash is extended if I need to reel her in quickly. Very angry and disgusted with this product. Utter garbage, and I will never buy anything from this company again. Would rate this zero stars if I could."

55994,2,"I've owned nothing but All-Glass aquariums for almost 10 years, and in my experience, the plastic hoods are a waste of money. I've owned many, and have been impressed by none. The All-Glass VersaTops are far superior in my opinion.1.) The deluxe hoods generally come with a single-tube strip light with no reflector, only cheap plastic above the bulb. The twin-tube strips will have a reflector to increase the efficiency of the bulb. Invest in at least a twin tube right away (make sure to get the twin-tube glass tops as well), especially with the deeper tanks. Quality of lighting is much better without having to break the bank with specialized lighting.2.) The access panel is clumsy and the plastic hinged joints break or crack easily. Every one I've owned has been very noisy when opening/closing. Glass tops offer more visibility and a smoother range of motion (they're quiet and will last longer).3.) More inconvenient to clean than a glass top. Visibility of water spots/mineral buildup very obvious if you don't maintain them properly. Usually takes a lot of scrubbing to remove the deposits completely.4.) Oak accent coating on light strip tends to wear off easily.5.) Hood allows for a greater rate of evaporation. Glass fits snugly into the lip of the aquarium and greatly reduces evaporation; i.e., you don't have to top-off the water frequently.6.) Cutouts on the rear of the hood are inconvenient and if the outlined pattern is followed, leaves too much room for that occasional fish to escape (nobody wants carpet-critters) and restricts customization for placing equipment. Glass VersaTop has a clear plastic strip for the rear panel which is easy to cut (to your specifications, also helps with evaporation, leaves less room for jumping fish to escape) and is very easily replaced.In my experience, the hoods are functional, but I've found glass to be far superior in performance, reliability, quality, appearance and maintenance (and I haven't broken one yet)."
90116,2,"I thought these perches were a brilliant idea at first. My cockatiels loved them.Two days ago we woke to find a very healthy 10 month old cockatiel dead, face down on the bottom of the cage. There was no signs as to what had killed her. We were naturally devastated. I had gone over in my mind repeatedly what could have killed her as the night prior she had been her usual chirpy cheeky cocky self. But last night was to reveal exactly what had happened to herLast night just before I went to bed I was watching my cockatiels who had just paired up and before my eyes what killed my first cockatiel repeated itself. Both birds were very healthy, lively characters. The cock was perched on the pedi perch to roost. He shifted slightly on the pedi perch, lost his footing, gave a squawk of fright and in shock plunged to his death. 10 minutes later he died from his fall. His mate who had witnessed the first plunge [unknown to us] also died from the shock of seeing a second cockatiel die in the same manner.If I could give a negative 5 star on this product I would.I have spoken to our local pet shop about what has happened and he is now sending all pedi perches back and is no longer stocking themBeware! I lost 3 very healthy birds in 2 nights through this perch"
64781,1,My two dogs love these. Now as to do they work. I honestly do not know. Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health. Stage four is the worst on his scale. I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better. If they maintain at stage two I would love it. Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks. Here's hoping!

My girl cat is just flat out a jerk and kicks her litter halfway across the floor. Living in NY in a tiny apt this is far from ideal. The Clevercat Top Entry Litter Box seemed like the perfect solution. I was so excited when it arrived. I had dreams of a litter and pee free floor!At first I kept the old box out as a standby. My cats REFUSED to go near this giant white monster. Infact, my boy cat walked up to it and hissed at it. Not a good sign. I tried putting away the old box leaving some poop in the new box to show them this is where the crap goes. Instead my boy cat ran to a basket I have next to my sofa and peed there. It was two days of pee and crap all over the apartment. Day three I was fed up.So, if anyone wants one, I have a completely unused one sitting in my living room taunting me of what could have been."

78834,0,"This item worked the first time right out of the packaging, but it has a habit of slipping off and down to his hind legs when he jumps or takes off from the sitting position. My dog stopped tugging on the leash and actually walked next to me, so the harness does what it claims. It's just the poor design of the strap placements. The reason I think why this harness slips off is because the front chest strap is designed to be lose and only tightens together when your dog tugs or walks ahead of you. Since it's loose, it tends to hang down below his chest when he's in a sitting position. Then when he gets up or jumps forward, his legs sometimes slips through the low hanging chest strap and then the whole thing slips back to his hind legs. The few times this has happened I was afraid my dog was going to take off running, leaving me behind holding the leash attached to the harness and no dog."

And after you have PEE STAIRS you get PEE PAWS! HOORAY! Now I have urine all over the house instead of litter!!!Luckily, my other cat does not pee out the stairs, she pees against the wall.

My sister in law who has 2 rather large cats and a small-ish apartment recommented TWBCL so I picked up a bag. This litter did not kick up dust when I poured it into the pan, but that's the only good thing I can say about this litter. My cats tried to eat the litter initially, but then took to using it. There is NO ODOR CONTROL whatsoever. My cats are great about ""covering their tracks"" in the box and I feed them a high quality cat food. It was as if I did not have any litter in their box at all. It also does not clump like the bag claims to do. I scoop daily. The clumps were not solid and crumbled regularly. Also the litter would barely cling to the solids. It also did not keep cat waste from gathering in the corners or the bottom of the box. My black kitten would come out of the box with her paws covered with a fine film of yellow, and our floor was getting covered in what looked like sawdust. I finally got fed up and threw everything out...the litter and the box...and am starting over again with a new brand of litter and pan."

78422,0,"We have a high energy 36lb puppy who understood by clicker training where he was supposed to heel, but would lose position and pull whenever he saw something exciting on the walk such as frogs, birds or squirrels.So we tried out this harness. By using a small piece of cheese as a lure, he quickly learned to put his head through the harness and then stand still while we clipped it on. It doesn't rub or come loose or dig in anywhere, but you do have to make sure everything is in the correct anatomical position according to the instructions and adjust it if your dog is still growing. After a week or so, we didn't need the cheese, as he loves to go for walks and wanted to put his head in the harness all by himself.On walks it was fantastic - a gentle correction and he would just come back to heel perfectly. He never minded the corrections at all and it was also easy to stop him before the behaviour escalated. It really seemed to make him understand that we didn't want him to pull. The harness is very gentle, very effective and there is no chance of injuring the throat or neck. I think it is great and it worked wonders with our dog.The downside? It says on the box not to leave the harness on your dog. They're not kidding. Unless your dog is actually walking with you, you cannot leave it on for even a couple of minutes. One day I put the harness on him and popped him immediately into the car as he was going to the vet. As soon as he lay down in the car, he was able to get his nose under the breast strap and he chewed it through in about 20 seconds. He did the same thing to the replacement strap. It's very flimsy material - it looks just like one of those inexpensive colored mylon leashes that you see all over the place, but our dogs often chew on those and they don't break or fray. If they upgraded the breast strap to a regular strength I would give this harness 5 stars."
33507,0,"I bought this food after researching ferret nutrition for some time before getting my first ferret. I wish I would have read some more before I bought it. Not only did I pay too much ($19 at Petco) but I'm not crazy about some of the ingredients. The 3rd ingredient is rice, which ferrets can't digest so I guess it's there for filler. It also has banana puree and raisin juice- sugars are not good for ferrets. I also don't like that the fat level is low and the shape has a tendency to get stuck in ferret mouths.On the plus side, it's inexpensive and my ferret likes it. It only makes up about a quarter of his food mix so it balances out. (He also gets Natures Variety Instinct Duck/Turkey and Wellness Core)The ingredients are better than Marshall's food so I recommend this food over that. I used the MoreDooks food chart to compare."

20118,1,"I have had a cat and a kitten for about 6 months now. I had tried a myriad of kitty litters prior to settling on Feline Pine. Since one was a kitten and both came from a shelter, I don't think the cats were particularly picky about their litter. I switched them from clay to pine pellets without using any transition and they were unphased.After using Feline Pine for a few weeks, I decided to go ahead and buy two of the litter boxes made for the litter. Having the ability to sift out the sawdust (which is created when cat urine breaks down the pine pellets) into the bottom pan has made litter box cleanup SUPER easy!This is what I do: 1. Scoop solids once per day and shake the box side to side in the evening to move any sawdust that the cats didn't scratch down into the bottom pan. 2. Empty the bottom pan about one time per week by dumping into a 5-gallon bucket with lid. 3. Place a few of the slightly broken down pellets (those that have been in the litter box for a week) into the bottom pan. This keeps the sawdust from sticking to the bottom pan and makes dumping easier. 4. Add some fresh pellets to top tray if it looks too shallow. I do this when dumping bottom tray. 5. Completely empty the top tray about one time per month. Place some old pellets in bottom tray as stated above.You can apparently use the sawdust as compost. I prefer to get rid of it by dumping the 5-gallon bucket into a trashbag when full. Then again, I also have dogs and I worry they would get into the compost. Another note - a 20-25lb. bag lasted me about a month (with a little left over) and that took care of two litter boxes.My final suggestion ... and this has been mentioned before ... if you have a local farm store such as a Tractor Supply Company, look for Equine Pine which is horse bedding. It is the same thing, but costs FAR less. Up until recently, I was buying Feline Pine at $9-11 for a 20-25lb. bag. I found Equine Pine for about $6.50 for a 40lb. bag. MUCH CHEAPER!"

143371,0,"First off, the concept is great. Honestly, this is great for the cats and containing the litter fling. Now the reality:1) Is this really manufactured by Littermaid as well? I know it is, but can someone not take accurate measurements? Assembling the plastic rods was annoying enough, but for the joint connectors to be so dang brittle they snap? That was the first call to them asking for a free replacement.2) We have the Littermaid Mega Elite pooper scooper. The dang thing doesn't fit in the tent. The cartridge box hangs about half way out. Hello? Does Littermaid not design these for their own product? Also, this was designed so poorly to move the box in and out of the tent. You eventually have to do a cleaning of the entire contraption, and they sure don't make it easy.3)That little flap on the bottom of the entry is utterly useless... and zipping the tent back up is like trying to put on a pair of jeans three sizes too small just after you at at a buffet for 3 hours: Utterly impossible. I had to literally take the tent apart and take a quarter of an inch off of each rod to assemble it in a fashion that I didn't think the tension was going to implode the tent on my poor cats.3) The little window flap for the box switch and electrical: Why is it on the left? This is annoying. I need it on the right wall. This is just not convenient. If anything this flap should be on the back of the tent.Recommendations:If you buy this thing, take about a quarter of an inch off of each rod BEFORE you attempt to assemble it. If you don't, you'll drive yourself nuts trying to zip the dang thing up and about the point where the zipper fails on you the first time, you'll snap one of those joints.I modified the tent: I put a piece of wood in the bottom of the tent to allow for easier sliding of the box in and out. I snipped the little lip off to accommodate this.I also attached a vent in the upper right of the tent at the back wall with a exhaust fan of sorts to draw the kitty smell away and out. I have three little computer fans and a plastic flexible dryer vent that links to a port and draws the smell out a vent like a dryer. Yeah, I'm in it for the long haul but you appreciate this when the windows aren't open and the house is stuffy.Lastly, if Littermaid really cared, they would pick up on this by now. They haven't and we still buy the darn thing since it is the only one. All I can say is, if it breaks, call 'em up and tell 'em to replace it. Don't throw away the Customer Service paper that's in the box."
156018,2,"So I purchased these bows for my female maltese, being that she has long hair and I try to keep it out of her eyes...and for once I decided to use something pretty instead of regular black hair bands....MISTAKE. These bows are made in a strange way, the way the band is attached will leave the bow sideways....impossible to straighten them out. And the elastic is very stiff and will not stretch...which makes an already hard job even harder. When I did managed to get them in (crooked) they lasted about ten minutes...and then fell apart.....This being a dog that wears a sweater constantly and never pulls at it....the tiny beads are glued on and my pup promptly ate one of them, and while you should receive two of each color you will receive about four or five that do not match whatsoever....I would not buy these again."

We bought a squirrel squeaky mat (made by Kyjen) the same day and we gave it to him several days before the chew chain. The squirrel toy has been played with a ton more than the chew chain, and it has held up incredibly well. I wouldn't buy this product again. I am going to stick with the Kyjen toys from now on."

If I had seen this product in a store for $25 I would have passed it by, probably worth closer to to the $10-15 range.

155793,0,"The original review was for Rawhide Depot. They came 100 ears in a box, no plastic, no smell, and were ""flattened."" These from BestBullySticks were curled, as if just getting cut from the cow, were stinky, and packaged in plastic 25 ears per bag. The dogs don't seem to care. They are still the best value on Amazon, but I may look to other vendors in the future. I don't know how BestBullySticks inherited my review from Rawhide Depot.Original Review:This was an awesome value for these cow ears. They are very large and my dogs just love them. I used regular shipping and they arrived in about a week. I thank you, and my dogs, Dollee and Chee thank you.Added: I have made several purchases from Rawhide Depot, and their cow ears did vary quite a bit in size, shipment to shipment."

204998,2,"Easy to install. That's the only good thing I have to say. There is nothing to this door. It's plastic. It has a small frame that doesn't seal well. The magnets at the bottom don't keep the door closed well....the slightest breeze keeps the flap open. When closed, you can see right between the flap and the frame...about a 2mm gap all the way around. Needless to say, not airtight in the least. There is only a frame for one side of the door. The other side ends up looking like a hole cut in the door...which it is, but it should at least have the edges covered."
78847,0,"I don't like how this works. Maybe it would work alright if your dog always pulls forward, but my dog pulls to the side a lot to go sniff something or chase a chipmunk. And when she pulls to the side, this harness basically pulls her two front legs out from under here. She has done multiple face plants because of this issue, so I'm done with trying to train with this product. I'll look into a head collar instead."
39167,2,"we recently adopted a stray cat and i went searching the web for a litter box. we've only ever owned dogs so this was very new to me. I came across the omega paw and thought it was an awesome idea!! i've had the box for a lil over two weeks and i've already given up on the rolling. it never dawned on me that turning it completely over would leave the pooh to roll along the grate and ceiling leaving the box extremely funky after you ""cleaned"" it. not to mention you're supposed to clean it everyday because the space is so small. Instead of throwing it out, i removed the tray (so now she has a lil window to peep out of lol) and the divider so she can use the entire box and i open and scoop! MUCH roomier and less smelly!!"
21437,2,"It looks like the company may have fixed it now, but when I ordered it was really cheap for 6 trays with ridiculously expensive shipping, I figured it evened out to still be the cheapest per tray, so I ordered it.

The company refunded the shipping costs after I complained, but the price for the one was not any better than the other companies I could have purchases from after that. At least the company worked with me though. Good customer service."

Even when I point to my dog 5 feet away, it still has no effect. Don't waste your money. Throw empty coke cans filled with a few pennies. It works better..."
134335,0,"I have had many power and canister filters over the years and this NOT one of the better ones. I love the concept of the Bio-Wheel and have a smaller version for my 10 gallon tank. So I decided to get a big one to help with filtration on my 210 gallon (I also have a Fluval FX5). The main purpose was to have a handy filter I can switch out bags of Carbon and Purigen with (it is a pain to open the big FX5 every other week- and a filter such as this takes seconds to switch out, since it has lots of room). The filter has 4 slots for media cartridges (it comes with 2), and has a high output, gallons per hour (that I've noticed), which is good. It does it's job very well, and I can switch out my media bags (I use the 2 front slots for the media cartridges and put 2 bags of my own media behind them). The ONLY problem I've found with the filter is that it makes noise (yes I know it's a power- or hang on the back filter, but compared to the Aquaclears I've had- it is a bit much). Even with the tank filled to the brim - it puts out noise comparable to a small fountain in my living room! I can understand a slow meandering trickle or even a small steady waterfall, but this sounds like a roar compared to other filters like this that I've owned. Ok, to be fair it is what it is- the high output of this filter(which is actually a good thing), is what is causing the amount of noise. So it's not a design flaw- it's doing what it is supposed to. I just wanted to warn you of the amount of noise you should be prepared for. My 10 gallon has the smallest version of the Bio-Wheel and I love it. But this huge one is quite annoying. I still love that it does what it does perfectly for me (high output, and easy to switch out media). So I am going to have to find a way to slow down the output (which I haven't figured out a way yet). That WOULD be the ONLY way (besides filling your tank to the very top-which doesn't work), to get the noise to settle down- despite what others have said about the Bio-Wheel loading up with bacteria and slowing down. What actually happens is that the Bio-Wheel loads up with algae and THAT is what slows it down. In MOST cases this isn't that bad, but since I use Purigen in my media setup- I don't EVER get any alage. Which is one of the reasons why I love it (besides others- see Purigen), but if you don't have purigen in your setup then your filter WILL slow down eventually. So in closing I hope you find this information helpful in your filter selection."

You have to send the thermometer back to the factory at AMC (Advanced Monitors Corp) for service and for a ""nominal fee"" at their discretion they will either replace the battery or the thermometer.Not sure it would be worth the postage fees and ""nominal fee"" which are between $49 and $79 from what I have found in their manual and online.Obviously it would be cheaper to buy a new one but I am hoping that it will last for several years before I have to do that."

We have had troubles before and had to take her in to a costly teeth cleaning at our vet's office. I was pleasantly surprised because she loved it! She even followed me when I was finished, because she wanted more brushing!I first let her taste it and then used the small side of the long toothbrush and was able to scrub on all on her teeth - even the ones in the far back. She was okay with it and thought it was fun, because she tried to bite at it to play.I chose this doggie toothpaste because of the enzymes, non-foaming, toothbrush choices, and beef flavor. I am happy with my choice as it takes the stress out of brushing my 8 year-old baby's teeth. She likes it and it is something that needs to be done. The best part is her fresh doggy breath!"
21579,1,"Got the litter box about 3 weeks ago and our 3 cats took to it within 2-3 days. They say with one cat it'll last 30 days and from my experience with 3 cats (I can stretch it about 10 days), that is right in line with their claims.I don't know what kind of mega-whizzing-craptastic cats these people with one cat who say it only lasts one week have... If this wont last for one week with a single cat, you better bring em to a vet. I have one small cat, one large one, and an old one that pees all the time and the cartridge handles them easily for a week plus.The crystals really do a great job of capturing the smell -- just mix em up every couple days to spread out any uneven wetness spots (like if your cat prefers using one corner).The only downside is the cost.. $45 a month is pretty high to maintain the box for 3 cats. Planning on trying out one of the ""forever"" refillable litter trays with my own bag of Fresh Step crystals.UPDATE 12/28/07 -- With 3 cats, I can go a full two weeks, product still awesome.. The metal tines are beginning to rust however due to sitting in wet pee from time to time."

Only buy this if you keep your tank in a secluded area where you wont be bothered by a constant hum. I guess I got what i paid ten bucks for.
173243,2,"After pondering which litter box to purchase I decided on this one. There were so many positive reviews that I figured it was worth the extra money. It wasn't.First - the lid is awful to put on and take off. It isn't easy and honestly it's a royal pain. The lid is terribly awkward to take off and getting it to line up right to put it back on is a joke.Second - odor control. What odor control? I may as well have my cat use an open box because there is NO odor control at all.Third - this is not the fault of the litter box itself but the plant was missing a piece.Fourth - scattered litter. Sure this happens with lots of litter boxes but it seems worst with this one.This litter box is going back. I have already purchased a $25 box for my furry friend and it works perfectly. It's compact but large enough for multiple cats, keeps the litter in the box and the odor under control.Save yourself the headache."

The scraper side reminds me of the hook side of Velcro and I was a bit skeptical.Not to worry, dorsal fin breath. The magnets are very strong which results in a bit of a hopping motion in my 90gal tank. I got used to that and improved quickly. This removes even fairly thick growth; just need to go over it a few times in different directions. My old scraper simply could not do this. I was a bit skeptical about the floating part but after one use, I think it's an indispensable feature.Nice job on the product and I thank the reviewers once again for taking the time to post! That's actually one major reason why I continue to shop at Amazon. Whoulda' thunk?"
179624,0,I have had these pans before and they are OK but I think that they should last longer. They crack and break eventually and then you have to buy another one. I liked the metal one that initially came with the crate years ago.

208033,2,"I'm not quite sure how to pinpoint the problem... but I went through this whole tub and my reef was not really happy. (55 gallon tank) My trumpet, frogspawn, and hammer corals were all receding and I couldn't figure out what was going on. Fish have all been fine though. I do big water changes. The first water change I did with a different salt, things started looking better. Another 50% water change later, and things are bouncing back to life. Just my 2 cents. Not a good experience for me."
150016,0,I like this but the plastic end seems not to please my cats. They are not be catnip fans and prefer something to chomp on.
74541,0,Fairly easy to install. My 20 pound pitbull puppy can get through the small pet door. I know once she is bigger this won't be an issue. For now my cats have to jump over the gate. There is a horizontal bar across the top of the small pet door. After just one week of using the gate my puppy figured out that by using that horizontal bar that she can climb over the gate. So now the gate is only good if I can be there to keep an eye on her. If I leave she can get over it and destroy things.
192813,1,"I have looked ""everywhere"" for hangers for my chihuahua's clothes. (She has a LOT.) I was very excited when I found these.The only drawback was that they fit too tightly over my closet rod, so I have to go buy a skinnier rod. That's certainly no big deal, and it's probably the exception, not the rule.Thank you, thank you, thank you."
12440,0,"I was hesitant to buy because the product info said that this was a 2.75ounce container but the picture had a 2.2ounce container. I know Tetra is running a 25%more promotion now so i though that this would be the promotional 2.75ounce container so i took a dive and bought it. Two days later I received a 2.2ounce container, disappointed. They should change the product name to reflect that, otherwise its misleading"
167540,0,I purchased one of these for our Jack Russell which goes through volley and soccer balls like they were balloons. He loves to roll them using his nose but if able to trap the ball will find a seam and pop - no more ball.This ball is almost indestructible but in it's hardness it becomes scratched and gets burrs that cut and abrade his nose to the point of an open wound. And as Russell owners know that will not stop them.A great ball if you watch and keep the scratches and burrs smoothed down. I'm still looking for a ball that is a little less hard but tough enough to prevent a tooth from penetrating it. A basketball would be perfect but for the tiny gripper nodules which act as sandpaper as he rolls it around the yard.
70473,1,"The frame keeps the top of the bowl 18 inches off the ground, and 5 quarts is a large bowl. Unfortunately, our chihuahua somehow manages to stand on his hind legs and eat out of our greyhound's6516 SS DBL DINER 5QT 18IN - 5 Quart - Stainless Steel. Other than the chihuahua issues, this set is fantastic for large dogs."
117008,1,"I found a bottle of this at my local grocery store, and bought it without high expectations... Wow! I definitely wasn't expecting the quality of the product to be so high! You can put this stuff on literally anything, even pour it on a spot and let it dry to eliminate odors. I can even use it in my carpet cleaning machine. What really did it for me was when it took out a hot chocolate stain that was dried on my carpet for weeks, while nothing else would take it out. I would recommend this product to anyone!!!"
152066,2,"I have to admit that I'm very disappointed in the design of this tent. I'm tempted to just go back to old style of enclosed litter box that I used to have. I'm not all that impressed with the actual LitterMaid Elite to begin with, but this tent just made it worse. The tent's design is good in theory but impractical in reality. The first issue I have is that, while it does keep the litter from being kicked all over the sides and spreading all over the room, all the litter collects along the bottom and inside of the tent itself, so when you try to take the litter box out, you leave a trail of used litter that has collected since the last time you moved the box. The tent design does not give my normal sized cats ample room to move around, dig, do their thing, etc. One has even made a point of going potty in front of the litter box out of protest. The sides and top of the front curve are too short to even allow the arms of the collection bin to completely move as needed. So this tent even hinders how my litter box works. (That's even after the fact that the box does not fit all the way to the back of the tent.) Moving the box is the other issue. Since this is made like a real tent (which I didn't realize when I bought the thing) it has a bottom piece. The LitterMaid Elite is not a small or light box, especially when filled with litter, so when you put the litter box into the tent, you have to lift the box off the ground, place it in the tent, then place it back on the ground (which is especially a pain with the LitterMaid Elite because the top piece and the main body of the litter box come apart when the whole litter box is moved). If you try just sliding the box into the tent without picking up the whole thing, the fabric bunches and can easily tear since the fabric is so tightly stretched. Say you want to reprogram your litter box, or you want to manually scoop it (since the rake misses some of the smaller clumps), you have to lift the whole thing to move it out of the tent, all while leaving a trail a litter (both from what's left over in the tent from all the digging the cats do and from the litter box itself). I bought this hoping to contain the enthusiastic digging habits of my two cats. It was supposed to make my life easier by eliminating the need to sweep and steam mop my floor everyday. Instead, it has created more work and has hindered some of the functions that my litter box offers. I'm not impressed and I'm trying to get rid of it/ return it. Don't waste the money. Don't deal with the frustration."
118248,0,Product arrived & I was expecting the package to be bigger. Vendor should put cubic inches or dimensions in the product description so that buyer knows better what they're getting. This package won't last long. A little disappointed. Product is good quality.
61973,1,"I was a little worried that this product wouldnt work. When I received it the very next day, and applied it to my dog It started to work immediately. I would definitely recommend this to another person...Also the shipping was excellent!"
181645,0,"This product is very well made and just as described and pictured. I've given it a ""3"" only because my budgies are completely terrified of it, which was what I thought might happen. Time will tell whether they will ever recognize it as a perch. The brightly colored plastic sides are just not similar to anything they've ever seen before. I was trying to find temporary perches that would let them sit in comfort on the roof of their own cage and that of their canary friend, which is where they spend much of their time, but which could be removed easily for purposes of covering the cages. I haven't been able to find anything to fit that purpose. This perch is also a little thick for a small bird (max of 3/4"" would be better) but I figured it would be all right for part-time use. I will attempt to update this review later if my birds catch on and say, ""Eureka, a perch!"""
114579,2,"We purchased this cat door about 8 months ago, and are at the point that we need to replace it. It was easy to install (30 minutes max) and our cats are able to go through it easily, but the locking mechanism does not work. Our cats (small females) are able to push right through the door even when it's in the locked position. There are times we would like to keep the cats contained in the basement, but to do so we have to put something in front of the cat door or tape it shut. The last time we did this, one of the cats chewed the magnetic strip right off the door, so now it does not stay closed. Do not purchase this door if you need to lock it from time to time."
207782,0,granted I had a specific space under the stairs I wanted to fit so the dimensions were important but the bed was not a filled out 5 x 36 x 24 but 2 inches smaller in each dimension. It looked well made but I had to return it because it just wasn't the right size for my needs.
23745,0,"I have a 20 year old male that is a very good eater. He has been on seed/pellet mixes his whole life and eats any kind of table food. This mix, while very clean and fresh looking, has alot of small seed (millet and other) that my bird will not touch. With the exception of the nuts and dried fruit chunks, it looks like a cockatiel mix. He's wasting probably 25% or more. The price on Amazon was the best I found and it is a nice mix - but not for birds that do not care for small seeds."
197000,0,"I set this up in the evening when I wanted the lights on. When they were supposed to go off it didn't work. However, the timer began to work the next day when the lights were supposed to turn back on. Apparently the timer needs to go on first. Also, the night outlets are switched with the daytime outlets for the auto (timer) mode.Overall it works, but I wasn't very impressed with it."
73260,1,"I purchased this cage a few days ago because my gerbil had been living in a really small cage with almost no accessories, I work full time so the little guy was getting fat and lazy. For the first two days he wouldn't leave the wheel, but since he's figured it out he's all over. I've never seen him so active. I would rather clean his wheel everyday to get his droppings out than have a fat/lazy gerbil that could have obesity problems and die. I would recommend to anyone who wants their pet to get exercise."
94156,1,"I have this filter hooked up to a a 20g tank with my two turtles in it. Up until I got this filter, I was changing filters at least once a week. My boys are messy eaters and even messier when it comes to potty use, so their tank dirties pretty quickly. I also had new rocks in my tank which still had alot of dust on them, the take cleared the tank beautifully, although it took a good two days. That being said, This filter is awesome! Its noisy if there is air in it when you first start it up, but it works itself out eventually and runs real quietly.I just cleaned the filter out yesterday and it ran for two weeks straight with no odor from the tank. There was no way my boys could ever go two weeks without a filter change and stinking up the house. This filter keeps the water really clean and keeps the odors at bay. My charcoal bag will need to be replaced in another week or so, but I got a good month out of one filter. Filter cleans easily but has lots of parts to take apart to clean. My intake and return tubes were junked up with biological debris, but a wire hanger and a twisted paper towel cleaned them out and they look brand new.My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is the filter is a little cumbersome to set up initially and I needed to revert back to the instruction manual after I took it apart to clean it. While this filter works amazing, it does take a day or two to really get the water nice and clear. The intake casing which gathers the debris from the tank has very small slats in it so some larger particles do not get collected. All in all, its well worth the $29 I spent on it and will be getting this filter for my other turtle tank as well as our fish tanks."

161574,2,It's been almost a month and I have yet to receive my product...so I'm waiting to receive my refund. I buy things from Amazon all the time and receive them on time OR early. I found it odd to wait for ONE clicker that costed me $8..when I could easily get a three pack for the same price. Complete waste of time...
13416,1,Doing a review of my previous review.....I didn't give it enought time. This toy is amazing! Tie ona jingle bell and it is so cute to watch! Young kitten loves it...older one does too since he isn't being pestered!

193896,2,This is rated for a dog up to 100lbs so I was sure it would work for mine which is about 55 pounds. Received the product and used it twice the day I got it and when I used it the next morning it broke. Geroys did issue a refund but it took 3 emails(about 5 days) to get them to respond to me. Once they did issue the refund it came quickly.
36277,2,"I have this review under another listing for this product, can't believe it is still being sold!Amazon!! Please allow users zero or negative ratings on products!!___________________________________________________________________________Never!! Please, never ever use this product!We have two beautiful healthy young dogs (4-5 yrs), with a pristine health record (until hartz of course). They get premium food - Timberwolf Organics, Acana, Origen, Blue (I mention this because poor diet is often associated with illness in your pawsy companions).We had new neighbors with dogs move in a few weeks ago and my little one had started itching a bit. I was going to order frontline from petmeds and instead picked this up in a split second decision while walking out from Wallys. My logic being, ""hey if it doesn't work, I can still order the Frontline"". Plus it was priced at only $[...]On Saturday evening, I showered the girls and applied this on my itchy one. The next day my dog started showing signs of minor epileptic shocks - yelping in her sleep...yes I do know about dog dreaming, but these dreams, if they were that, were, with shock, pain and disorientation. Since it was Sunday, our regular vet was unavailable. We had no idea how serious this was about to become! That night, convinced that she was having a series of bad dreams we made sure she slept close to us on the bed. The episodes continued that whole night, a couple of hours apart.Next morning I noticed some swelling on her snout and one of her eyes. There was also a red spot on her belly. By that time we had read other peoples reviews on this product and were shocked that this poison is still put out for unsuspecting consumers!! Alarmed we called the local emergency care and described her symptoms. They urged us to rush her there. By the time we reached the hospital, my baby had gone into an anaphylactic shock. She had petechiae all over her abdomen and she was swollen all over!She was hospitalized after she was stabilized with steroids, antihistamine and antibioticts. Our woes did not end there though. I can go into more details, but I feel it suffices to tell you all that after about four thousand dollars and a homeopathic detox program, we were finally able to get her close to normal. After about a month and a half today, she still takes some herbs and supplements to support and balance her messed up immune system.Just ONE tube of the three doses!!The amount of anguish and death related to this product far outweighs the justification of dogs who might be 'flea free'. In the course of that week we must have met at least half a dozen vets who just shook their heads when I mentioned the Hartz product!! It has killed hundreds of cats apparently and is more fatal to their littler bodies (my dogs are about 65lbs each).There is a whole chronology of harm on [...]Please do not, do not buy this poison!!"

24032,2,"When I searched in Amazon for ""chicken jerky treats made in USA"" this product was listed. No where in the product discription did it mention the country of origin. I purchased this product in a smaller size from a local retailer and the package said ""MADE IN USA"" so I naturally assumed that the 20 ounce tub would be the same. What a surprize. When the package arrived I opened it and gave a piece to my dog, then I noticed that the label said ""PRODUCT OF CHINA""! I cannot give this to my dog as it causes severe symptoms.Either Amazon is misrepresenting the product as Made in USA or the manufacturer is. In either case, I have learned my lesson, NEVER BUY DOG TREATS FROM AMAZON."
151550,2,They're very easy to use and keeps them from scratching and the cat doesn't seem bothered...at first. but after a few days my cat started hiding again because she didn't feel safe anymore since she couldn't scratch. The glue is extremely strong and difficult to remove.

She will stay there for hours toasty warm. I reheat it about dinner time. I recommend this to everyone with a small animal or an elderly animal who has a hard time getting warm. Yes, they are hard, but my dog has never seemed to mind it. I have even used it in my bed to keep my feet warm!"

160151,1,"We bought this for our betta's 2 gallon tank. Even though you can't adjust the heat settings, it heats the tank just right to make our fish friend happy! My hubby made the mistake of leaving the heater on while it was out of the water (and on a paper towel =/) one time, which ruined the heater obviously. But we turned right back around and got another one! We've had this second one for a year and it's still doing awesome!"
206710,0,Product came Extremely fast!! Ordered on Friday & got it on Wednesday. Quite impressed with that.One thing that was not clear in the description or the picture was that there is a 20in long piece after the retractable mechanism that does NOT retract. It is pictured with a length extended but it is not made clear that it does not retract. I expected it to retract all the way like every other retractable leash. The product description needs to explain that a little better. I was a little upset at this. When I want as short leash on my Mini Aussie I want it SHORT. I can cut it off & make it work but for $25 I should not have to modify it.Otherwise I am very happy with it. The loop for your hand seems pretty comfortable & should give great control. Will know better when I use it. At work right now so will walk the monster later.
213705,0,"I have 2 dogs and I try to brush them daily, as they have medium coats and arer outside a lot. I was using another bath spray previosly with no adverse problems. However, after about a week and 1/2 of using this daily, one of my dogs developed a skin allergy to it. We didn't immediately relate it to the spray as the other dog is fine. So just a word of caution--always be on te watch when using new products on your pets--they can't tell you how it makes them feel! Nice scent, though."

110653,0,"These collars are made two full inches too short (and they shrink -- see below). The 10"", which I bought, measure only 8 inches from the mid-buckle clasp to the furthest hole. I'm using these as ID tag straps for equipment and luggage, and I'm actually happy that they are much shorter than comparable pet collars. I can't find 8"" pet collars anymore. They are also somewhat defective because the stitched end that wraps around the buckle is wrapped the opposite way most ""normal"" pet collars are done, with the raw side on the outside of the collar. Again, compared with the other pet collars I've purchased, the raw side is so rough that you wouldn't actually want it rubbing against your pet's neck. But it is less attractive this way, to be sure, though it won't affect the performance of the collar.UPDATE: I must really recommend NOT using these collars on pets -- they SHRINK for some reason, perhaps after getting wet, but I really am not sure. As mentioned above, I didn't intend to use these 10"" collars as actual pet collars. As it turned out, though, a neighbor found an abandoned litter of kittens and convinced me to take two of them, and I very handily had this bunch of little collars in various colors. These 10 inch collars were a very roomy size for my scrawny 3 month old kittens. But when I checked on them a week later, I saw that the collar was kind of tight on one of them. I unbuckled it to move to a different hole, and noticed that it was very frayed, obviously from the cat scratching at it. I took it off to see if there was something else about it irritating the kitten, and saw that somehow the scratching had actually made the collar curve --- one edge of the collar had become shorter than the other. I checked the other kitten's collar, and it had the same thing, though less severe. I didn't think much of it, and found some other collars for the kittens from my stash, ones from another manufacturer that were the proper length for a 10"" collar. Today, I took out my box of little collars, including the old frayed ones plus some new ones from this company, and instantly realized that not only were the old ones frayed and misshapen (curved), they had also become shorter, by a full inch on one of them! I am not aware of my kittens having ever gotten really wet, but it could have happened. I am at a loss to imagine anything else that could shrink a nylon collar -- BEWARE!!"
18364,0,I thought it was going to hold more loose hairs than what it actually does. Not the greatest grooming product I've bought. Make sure to use it outdoors because all hairs fall to the floor.

39514,0,"I love the idea, and it works, but not quite as well as I had hoped. Maybe it's because I use the clumping ""Feline Pine"" which doesn't clump as tightly as others. Small bits of poo and pee get stuck in the slots and to the bottom/sides. Also, I have to shake it like mad to get the clean litter to filter through the slots, then shake it again to get it back into the main compartment. I've only used it for a couple weeks, but it already needs a thorough cleaning. I got the regular size and the usable digging space is very small. I guess it is faster than cleaning a regular litter pan, but not by much."

While my female kit loves the slide and loves climbing the sides, the bars have snapped twice and I had to return it today for another one. The plastic is very cheap and I find it bending under her, and she's only 2 pounds. The tunnel doesn't fit in the spot it's supposed to, and my ferret is able to take off the secure clips on the side. All in all, it's not worth your money. Go for the more expensive cage. It's better in the long run."
44902,2,"I bought one of these several months ago. It was great for about two weeks, and since then it's been nothing but trouble.To begin with, the filter is essentially worthless. It has a few small, loosely packed granules of activated charcoal in a big bag made of white fuzzy filter material that doesn't even reliably collect the algae that inevitably form in the thing. The filters don't last months, as the instructions claim -- more like a week or two until they're hopelessly contaminated with algae and have to be discarded lest they cause the whole bowl to gunk up.Oh, did I mention the algae? This thing is just full of nooks and crannies that get splashed with water -- but don't stay wet or have continual flow over them -- perfect for breeding the icky green stuff. It's nearly impossible to clean it well enough to stop the growth once it starts; all you can really do is slow it down enough that -- if you're lucky -- it won't make the water taste bad or (worse) make your pets sick. In fact, we thought we'd sanitized the entire thing using bleach (no easy feat, and *not* something that should be necessary) only to see the algae regrow twice before we figured out that it was even inside the pump, which we had to disassemble into 3 pieces to clean -- well, clean, more or less. I'm not going to dump bleach into the pump, it has metal parts.I pin the blame for this one on the crummy filter, first and foremost, and on the product design that creates dark, damp, hard-to-clean surfaces everywhere. Oh, and did I mention that the filters are hard to find? Big chain pet stores are happy to sell you this water bowl (I assume they make more margin than on the Drinkwell, which was the original product in this category) but can't be bothered to stock the filters. There are aquarium filters in similar sizes -- those would actually even do some good, unlike the Petmate filters -- but the cheap pump won't generate enough pressure to give a decent flow rate through them. Nice.Don't make the mistake I did. Buy a Drinkwell, not the house-brand knockoff (this product) even if it's on sale."
15211,1,"I really like the product. It helped my dog stop barking. It was a little painful to see it work the first time, but after that it worked wonders."
69204,0,"I purchased this product two months ago to protect the backseat of my Honda Civic sedan from our long-haired, 40 lb. border collie. While the hammock does help protect the seat from muddy footprints and getting wet, it doesn't protect against hair, dirt, and sand as well as I would like. The main reasons for this are the two holes in the cover that allow for the passenger seat belt buckles to be exposed. These holes are relatively large and are right where my dog sits/lies in the backseat, so much of the dirt she picks up on the hiking trail falls right through the holes onto the seat. This cover would be so much better without that feature: I, for one, don't want my passengers to ride on top of a filthy dog seat cover anyway. Since it is so easy to install/remove, I always take it off and throw it in the trunk whenever I have passengers.The other complaint that I have is that the cover tends to move around quite a bit, especially where it attaches to the front headrests. Whenever we adjust the front seats, the cover sags between them, making it much easier for the dog to jump over it or to put her front feet on the center console.The hammock style does, however, protect the back of the front seats and the floorboard pretty well. It is also reasonably well-made; I haven't had any trouble with it ripping or falling apart, despite how hyper the dog is in the car.I'm not totally happy with the product, but it still works much better than just a sheet or towel. Given the prices of similar products that seem to have the same features (and problems), I think this one is a deal and worth getting."
84336,0,"I bought this because my cat needs to be fed small meals several times a day, and the feeder was advertised as able to feed as little as 1/4 cup at a time. Doesn't actually work that way. It feeds reliably at the right time, but at the lowest setting it gives at least 1/2 cup. That's a disappointment. Otherwise, I found it easy to use, and good quality."
134133,0,"The ingredients appear to be pretty solid and our cat seems to eat it with no problem, but she regurgitates about once every week or two, and her bowel movements also do not always look ideal. She has also put on a small amount of weight since the switch, but that may or may not be related. This food is all she eats (aside from a daily Nu Cat multivitamin). These results combined with the other recent reviews claiming the formula for this food has changed in the recent past concerns me a bit, so we may be switching to Natural Balance Ultra Premium for our next bag. In other words, we can't condemn it, but there may be better options on the market. Petfoodratings[dot]net is a great resource for information.Update 11/4/12: We did switch to NB Ultra Premium and all issues have gone away."
42586,0,The strap that goes around the console lid the clip will not stay hooked so I'm not to happy about my purchase. If I put on the brake my dog is not going to be flying in the back of the car. I am going to have find away to fix it.

209919,0,"Am acclimating my two cats (litter mates) by exposing them gradually to the funhouse, both inside and out. I keep their nails trimmed, yet one has already torn a hole in the netting. The seller's assertion that it is sturdy and ""stands up to claws"" is not holding true for my felines. Somewhat disappointing for the price, therefore. I so wanted this to be perfect."

37599,1,This is a fairly light weight rubber/plastic mat with a raised lip around the outside edge.

This mat is doing a great job of keeping our floors dry.
43333,0,"A few complaints about this product--The base is calcium carbonate, which means you are giving your dog extra calcium with this supplement. The percentage, or serving dosage of calcium is not listed anywhere on the label. This may be ok for fully grown adult dogs, but puppies can't have high amounts of calcium with their growing bones. Especially large breeds. It would have been nice if the full ingredients were posted.The seller I purchased this from also adds a huge label with a upc code that blocks all the information and instructions on the product label, making it impossible to read. This caused me to miss the fact the product should be refrigerated. They should be more considerate of the end customer."
149685,2,"Piece of junk. Very flimsy and didn't seem to work. After about two weeks it had trapped one flea. Maybe I didn't have more, but for the money expected a little better quality and results."
155306,2,We purchased two of these and they arrived today.THE GOOD:1. They aren't scratched or damaged. They &#34;look&#34; nice as I take the pieces out of the box.2. They shipped quickly.THE BAD:1. They are cheap looking and feeling.2. They don't &#34;fit&#34; together like they should.3. There are LOTS of extra pieces with no where for them to go. (I guess it's better than not having enough pieces..right?)4. The cats still pull TONS of cat litter out of the box...on the very first try...and each time after that.5. My husband and I separately and independently put them together incorrectly (and we're both VERY good at this sort of thing).6. The cat door is much lower to the ground than it appears in the photo.7. It does nothing to help the cat litter smell.8. The whole thing is smaller than it looks in the photo as well.OTHER:We purchased two of the 'high sided' cat litter boxes that are recommended to go with this. They BARELY fit and you can see the little box when you look at the door... it looks tacky.I'm really and generally disappointed in this item. We spent 92.00 PER ITEM and I don't think it's worth 30. I'd send them back...but it'd be way to much work. Save your money! Buy a regular cat little box and put an end table over it...

46213,1,"String algae is a funny thing. It's hard to know when or why it appears, but it usually does. The only thing I have found that works to control mine is GreenClean. As others have said, read the instructions and it does what it says. It has now controlled my algae for 2 years. I got a late start this year, but it's working right now to reduce what built up. Bottom line, if you drain your pond, are very careful in power washing or otherwise cleaning it, then apply the product directly to the algae (turn the water off if you have falls until it stops flowing) the product will work. It's just that simple. I use it once a week in this manner and find the algae goes away.As for birds, I too was concerned. Customer service was very good in explaining this. As others have written they said after the product has contact with water it is safe for birds. Mine drink and bathe safely in my stream all the time. I stay out there until I turn the water back on, wash down all the powder that hasn't been diluted by the stream and ""It's all good."""
139,0,"but my dog still pulls like the dickens! I have nothing bad to say about the product. The material is soft and it arrived on time. I'm sure if I had the patience that I could train my dog to use it. But as soon as I put it on him he dedicates himself to getting it off. You can rig it to clip to his collar, but then he just shoves his paw between the lead and his mouth and leaves it there...it's actually quite funny. But I would suggest this product to an owner who's dog is used to muzzles or other things close to their face or mouth. Otherwise, it's a battle from the on set!"
176739,2,"There is something about the smell of this toy that is making my dog refuse to have anything to do with it. He usually isn't picky about toys, but he hates this one. Also, the handle is really small and the one time he did try to play with it, he couldn't figure it out (to be fair, he isn't the brightest bulb)."

122108,0,"As hummingbird feeders go, this sits about in the lower middle of the spectrum. It's not the worst design, but you ""get what you pay for"" without a doubt. Though the glass reservoir is very large and the feeder doesn't leak, that is about all I can say for the positive remarks about this feeder. The perch will become brittle and break after a couple of years in the sun. The flowers will also become brittle and need to be replaced about once a year. The flowers do nothing to keep the rain out because they're only inserts (the capillary effect still allows rain water in). The flowers also DON'T keep the bees or ants out (yellow flowers seem to attract more bees). Then you have the cleaning...This feeder WILL get moldy. Unless you have an arsenal of brushes that fit through tiny openings, you cannot get the mold out. Sure bleach will kill the mold, but it'll also kill the hummers. The bottom does not disassemble for easy cleaning (try a toothbrush or the rice suggestion from another review). The bottle has a narrow neck - good luck even getting a bottle brush in. Not only that, but the blessing of the large reservoir becomes a curse when your bottle brush can't reach the bottom to scrub.Yes, this feeder ""works,"" but you'll discover that the problems are not worth the money you saved on this cheap design. Save yourself the hassle and get the Aspects Hummzinger. You will not be disappointed."
4083,1,This dispenser holds a full bag of dog food and keeps my garage organized. I also like how it dumps from the bottom so the older food is served first and the new food is poured on top. This keeps my dog's food continually fresh as opposed to buckets where you are always scooping from the top and the bottom food can get stale.
102646,0,"I bought one of these years ago, and it was wonderful. SO well made, my cat loved it, it lasted a long time and was worth every penny. So after 4 years of having cheaper/shorter posts, I ordered another one of these. This time, I could tell the quality was nothing like before. The base comes in two pieces whereas the first one was one solid piece. It is not as heavy as the original, and the construction is lower quality. Still, my cat loves it and uses it all of the time. I just don't think this one will last as long as the last one. With the economy as it is, ALL companies are lowering quality in an effort to avoid raising prices, and this must be what happened here."
17111,2,"This bark collar worked very well for the two nights that we put it on our dog. We just put it on at bedtime, and took it off in the morning, to curb the nighttime, and early a.m. barking issues. It worked very well the first night. The 2nd morning, I found it in the backyard, chewed to pieces. I have no idea how he got it off, but since the collar was pretty lame, I assume he worked it off with a little creative pulling and scratching. For as much as I paid for this, it would have been nice to have a cheap faux leather collar attached to the heavy, bulky unit, with a buckle type clasp. Now, I am using a dog whistle type unit that is in a birdhouse style. It hangs from a hook on my back porch, covers 50 square feet, and has a timer, so I can set it to go off at night. Allowing my dog some freedom to bark during the day, while he is playing. Love the bird house! I bought mine at Pet Smart for $60, the salesman said to keep the box, and return it if it didn't work. I am keeping it!"

Not sure about you but I know sometimes my Morkie, Cooper is smarter than I am, so I have to be creative. It has helped me with potty training, stop chewing, and coming when I call him. I only use this when I fill that my verbal commands are not working. Cooper is now 6 months old and is going to be a wonderful adult dog. He has brought so much love to me, I am 71 yrs old and with the trainer and lots of patiences you can have a loving well behaved companion like me. Gwen"

197496,2,"I had bought EXO-Terra heat glo from a local pet store it didn't last long 2 months; I purchase another one and it only worked for 4 days a burned out, returned for an exchange of a new one it only worked for 2 weeks and died so, I went back to exchange for the fourth one and it worked for 2 months and died. Yesterday I purchased the fifth one and it only worked for 13 1/2 hours (i only use it during the day to help the UTH to heat up the ceramic tiles). I would only turn it on in the late afternoon by 2pm and off by 9pm. Before i purchase heat glo infrared bulbs, I always ask to have them check to see if the bulbs work. I don't know if it is a bad batch or poor quality, but five bulbs having issues after a day or a few months? This is not normal.My daughter also has a Leopard gecko and for the past 12 month went through 19 EXO-TERRA heat glo infrared bulbs, she checks asks at the pet store to see if they work before purchasing. We both only have them on in the after noon to heat the ceramic tile in the tanksMy daughter and I checked the clamp lights (her tank and my tank) with other bulbs and there is no issues with them. I' look for a Heat Mat the can penetrate glass and a 1/4 inch ceramic tile to keep it at 90 for belly warmth. In a small apartment the rooms are cool and with balmy winters we are looking for a high quality heat lamp. We'll look for another brand."
161812,1,"I love this wheel because of the little slots down the middle that let my Syrian hamster's droppings fall out! My hamster likes it too - she enjoys crawling in and out of the openings. And it has operated very quietly in the few weeks we have had it (attached to the side of the cage, not on the stand). But our hamster has grown too large to run easily in it (as another reviewer said it's only about 5-1/2"" in diameter), and it doesn't seem to be available in a larger size. I've been looking in vain for a larger wheel with a similar design. I give it 5 stars for a smaller animal."

168568,2,"I received this product and the head unit would sound an audible alarm, but the sprayer didn't work. I called the manufacturer and they quickly replaced it. The second unit worked, somewhat, but very poorly. Any cat with any sense can deal with this and laugh at you. Don't waste your money. Then when I tried to return it, I find out that it is supposedly hazardous materials and can't be returned!Nowhere did I see that it wasn't returnable before I bought it. Anyway, I am not done with this, I don't take no for an answer without a fight.However, I highly recommend you DON'T buy this product!Your choice, you have been warned..."
40333,2,"Ugh! This was not a good experience for me or my cat. My cat hated this litter box (it was just too small for her) and it was an absolute mess to clean. The internal sifter was just a huge pain in the butt to get clean and little bits of dried urine and poo would stick to the sifter. I was so disgusted with this box that I just threw it in the garbage. I was too upset to even return it. I just wanted it out of my house. I got a better one (through Amazon, of course!) and my cat loves it. (See my review of theX-Large Deluxe Hooded Litter Box (Colors May Vary)- now THAT'S a great litter box.)"

96083,0,"Before we start I would like to say that I did not order this from anyone I know of selling this on amazon, I bought at my local petco. Well the good is that my hamster uses it regulary. The bad is when I got it there was a tear in the litter and it went all over the place! With that stated I think there might be a sharp part in the set or something happened to it the factory. I went through the only two peices of it and it didn't break any skin. I do not know for sure about what happened so please keep that in mind when you purchase it."
137628,0,"Perhaps I'm just being fussy, but it would have received 5 stars from me if it had been a less toxic smell and sense about it. More ""green"", plus not in an aerosol can which really disperses the odor in a closed space. But it does work, and the price was okay, for cheap toxic chemicals."
130447,1,"Awesome nightlight for the little fishys.The two blue led's are just the right brightness for my twenty gal. tank to illuminate a small section.I bought one and installed it under the tank lid. This is a No-No!! Within 6 months it corroded and fell apart. Well, duh...The manufacture did offer a replacement if I had a receipt. I didn't. Oh well...For the secone one I drilled two holes in the lid, covered them with cellophane packaging tape to keep water out, and used double sided sticky tape to mount the light on top. No problem!!"
47149,2,"My 1 year old mini dachshund has tore through two of these types of toys (one boomerang and one round). The end seams are very well constructed; however, he tares through the middle part that is not reinforced.

End of the day. I have 2 balls with large chewed out holes and a dog pooping out orange plastic....."

182827,0,"I can't really say that the LitterMaid box was worth the expense and trouble for myself and my two cats. I received the box as a gift, and was shocked to find how much the replacement containers cost: 12 for $16-$18 in most places; and with two cats, I needed to replace them every 2 days, at least. Add this to the expensive litter required, and you find you are spending a substantial amount on litter removal (money better spent, in my opinion, on catnip and toy mice!).As others have mentioned, the mess does stick to the rake and the bottom, and cleaning the things throughly is a real hassle. And it does get stuck. I ended up having to check up on it twice a day, just as I would an ordinary box. With two cats, at least, it's not really a ""set it and forget it"" sort of thing.One of the biggest problems I found is that it does require so little litter: both my cats prefer a nice deep box with several inches of litter, and commonly went outside the box when they felt it was too shallow for them.These problems were all resolved when I purchased an ordinary box ($10)and a small metal trash container ($20) with a sealing lid and pedal. I depress the pedal with my foot, scoop the litter into the container, which I line with plastic grocery bags (free), release the pedal, and Ta-da!, everyone is happy and odor free."
8457,0,"These are too low for our wirehair Foxterrier. I wish I could have found the height listed somewhere before I ordered. I measured them to be 5.5"" of the floor to the top rim of the bowls. Way too low for our dog, he would need a height of about 10-12"". Now I have to pay the shipping to return them - not happy! Otherwise they seem very sturdy and they do look good.(in the 2 and 3 quart reviews I found the height measurements for those sizes!) The size of the 1 quart bowl is actually about perfect for Max (weighs about 20 lbs) ... I guess I will have to deal with bigger bowls to get the height right ..."

47868,2,"My dog wore it for a week maybe and he started chasing after another dog. As I pulled his leash which connected to the collar, the collar ripped. Really disappointed since these things are supposed to be able to support large dogs. Oh and my dog is only 35lbs."
44783,2,I bought this from a pet store because I thought constant fresh water was a great idea. But it isn't really fresh water it's water being recycled through a charcoal filter. Like anything with standing water it must be cleaned. After struggling with this product for a year I finally gave up and went back to putting fresh water in a bowl twice a day for the cat - and that is much easier. Not to mention the cat didn't seem to care one way or the other. Save your money and buy more catnip - something the cat WILL care about!
166417,0,I found the zapper would not work on my american bulldog at all because he has short short course hairs; with my two who are calico mix it would stun the fleas but not kill them. not really impressed with the product and would not recommend it to anyone.
18583,2,"What do I detest the most about these badly desinged heaters? There's the screw on clampy type way it's supposed to be installed on the upper edge of your tank, and depending on how that is designed the heater may or may not grip at all. Then there's the resulting total lack of flexibility as to how high the water level can be in your tank. Better fill it up to the brim, or you won't hit the ""water level"" indicated on the side of the heater. Then there's the big fat bulp design the makes it easy to crash it against the side of your tank accidentally. And, if it does get out of the water for more than a few second while on (I know that's no supposed to happen) it blows up and send shards of glass into the tank. Great product there. Some sort of pre WWII design maybe? Buy anything else...anything."

99257,2,I loved this feeder until it broke. We have gone through two different units and they both had the same problem.

I have a German Shep female(a pure bread which means she's rather smaller than average German Sheps), and according to the chart XXL is the size for my dog, so that was what I ordered.Well, it should have been two times as large as it is to fit my dog.I would estimate the real size of this XXL just L, no larger than that.I would recommend this sweater - just remember, you have to get two sizes larger than it shows in the chart for your dog."

155751,0,"My five dogs, Mastiff, 2 Labradoodles, 2 Blue Heeler puppies, all under 2 years of age, love Bully Sticks. I started purchasing them at Costco. When they stopped carrying them, for a several months, I purchased these from Amazon. Recently they have been thinner than the first ones I purchased. We go through several pounds a month. Costco has recently stared carrying them again. This batch at Costco, are mostly thick, some even Mastiff sized. In fact the 10 packages I purchased a month ago didn't have many, Doodle sized, only huge. So I cut them in half for the Doodles and Blue heelers, now 5.5 mos old. But never mind, they switch them all out amongst themselves so I've stopped cutting them in half. I use a big tree branch hopper.I was going to order a few packages of the smaller diameter for the ""smaller"" dogs, here, but the last few packages we purchased at Costco had a few smaller diameter.My 1.5 year old Mastiff finishes one of these smaller ones in a few minutes, if he doesn't get distracted. I then have to give him another and then another. I would rather give them all one large one. When the smaller dogs tire of chewing they will leave the stick, and sooner or later, another finds it for an extra treat. Thank goodness they get along well enough that there is no fighting when only one has a stick; otherwise I would be handing them out throughout the evening and next morning. They get the Bully Sticks when we are home to supervise.I will continue to purchase from Costco as long as they carry them and only purchase these when I have to. I've ordered the ""premium"" sticks but they cost quite a bit more."

15758,0,This product works as advertised. We are the proud owners of female basset that tends to do what she wants so we invested in the collar. The remote has two buttons one for shock and one for tone. I found that a very low shock followed by a tone worked great and corrected behavior quickly. We only need the tone now. Make sure you test the shock on yourself before using it on the dog so you know how it feels.The 3 star rating is based on the product quality. It's not made well. This is the 3rd collar we've had in 2 months. The first came to us and didn't shock but the tone worked. The second lasted approximately a month and would not turn one day. We purchased new batteries and still nothing. The third one is working fine so far...knock on wood. Battery life is 2-3 weeks with daily use. Amazon has been okay to deal with on these issues.Bottomline is the product works well when it works right. GOOD LUCK!!!

I looked around for the other cat and noticed clumps of cat hair all over the house.I started to panic and was preparing to bath the cats, when one cat began violently throwing up in the middle of living room.I thoroughly washed both cats, and they seem to have calmed a bit.

I actually find it easier to use my hand through a bag, or shovel and rake, so I figured this would be good to pack up to take on long walks to keep from having to have hands on when out for a walk."

110357,2,"My cat devoured this food! But there comes a time when that which is devoured... Must be de-devoured.... If you know what I'm sellin... I live in a larger 1bedroom apt. and she lit the entire 930 sq feet up with a stench that would have a wet nurse running out of the house... She has never, nor has any baby ever let this kind of raunch out of its body. I just can't take it! Awful! The entire apartment gets raunched, funktified.Currently, she's looking up at me with these innocent eyes, and in my head I hear in a Steve Erkel voice ""Did I do that!?"""

100981,0,"I like the heaviness of the ball; that part is durable. I was a little disappointed that there is a big hole in it along the seam line. My pup uses that to pick up the ball and that's good, but if the hole is necessary, I would like to see it in a different place on the ball and not in the seam line. In a matter of 2 days the ball is starting to come apart at the seam. In order make the ball last I have to put it up as soon as play time is over. So, this ball, with the large hole where it now is, is best for a dog that is not a heavy chewer."
204937,1,"These pads work really well.They absorb much better than the pads you buy and throw away.They wash up nicely.Am so happy i bought them,have saved me so much money."
189927,2,Received the product and noticed right out of the box that the carpet in the center of the post was kind of loose.Within 10 days my 2 cats had the carpet hanging off and the rope loose all around it. My husband put a bunch of staples in it with an air gun and it seems to be holding up. A consumer shouldn't have to fix a product purchased so soon after receiving it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the nice height and weight of it.I definately would not recommend this to anyone.
180440,0,"Overall the crate is a great value. I originally got it for my rabbit but the door is just too flimsy and I think I would have to use another reviewer's method of binder clips to secure it - otherwise it would be too easy for an animal to wiggle out or worse get stuck pushing it's head through the door. I did get it from the warehouse so it's possible that it was bent and then returned but really the door should be more solid and have a better locking mechanism.The crate is overall made well except for the door and it does indeed assemble and collapse very easy to a great storage size. The pull out unit underneath will make cleaning easy. The bottom wire has spacing too big for a rabbit or cat so would need to put a layer of cardboard or cloth to protect little feet -for a dog I think it would be fine. I was going to return it but decided given the good deal to keep it as I could use it if I need to take my cat with me since she's on a medical regime, and it's folded up totally out of the way under the bed so storage is not an issue. Given the good pricing I think it's a good buy if you are prepared to do a little work securing the door and don't have a vigorous animal who will be testing it's limits."
206736,1,"In my opinion this is an excellent retractable leash. I prefer it over the bigger ones, that have handles.It is lightweight, and fits comfortably in my hand. It can also be looped around the wrist.My dog is about 80 lbs, and is not a ""puller"", so I have not severely tested its strength. It certainly is plenty strong enough for a dog with leash manners.My previous Zip Lead was a present from my dog walker, who also preferred it to others. It lasted several years, and many hundreds of miles of dog walking, until somehow I got a knot inside it, that messed it up. I am glad that I have finally replaced it!"
44846,0,I love it & hate it. It is very loud even on the low setting. I have to turn it off at night because it keeps me awake from 3 rooms over. Its nice because it keeps it cold and does nice at filtering it but its just not what i was looking for. my cats love drinking from the sink because it falls down freely and this fountain doesnt do that. it just slides down the little ramp so they arent interested in drinking from the falling water but just from the bowl itself. I am going to return it and get something that i can feel happy about.
164792,0,Came quickly and I like the velcro fasteners. However it is too small around and to short in length. Sizing information might help ordering this E-Collar. Basenijis usually take medium size.

165611,1,"I have purchased many, many, many brushes for my dogs throughout the years and I finally found one that works great. Not only does it comb through my dogs hair cleanly and without pulling, it is so easy to remove the hair from the bristles when I'm done. I am going to order the smaller version too for my little dog."

182465,1,"This toy was included by the pet rescue where I adopted my dog. He is young, and chewing is his hobby. I purchased other chew toys for him, but this is his favorite and he actually actively chews it. While there is some wear, this toy has survived most of the other chew toys I gave him, which he made short work of destroying. He likes to play fetch with it, and he will go get it to play with and chew on his own. I recommend the Chompion."
148815,1,"I bought this crittertrail Z for my three hamster babies. They all love it. The wheel is very quite,and they love the pedding area. I bought another 2 cheaper critterctail basic cages, one for kiten, antoher one for batheroom,so they all happy live in there and make it very clean. The only thing is it is a little difficult for my hamsters get in to the ball. They are only 4 weeks old.Anyway, it is really a good house for my hamsters."
86623,2,"I have long searched for a good litter that would absorb and clump without pieces breaking off as you scoop. This is the absolute worst litter I have used in 20 yrs. Having purchased several scoopable litters this one more or less just became a piece of mud in the litter pan and never really activated with the urine to clump like most other litters of this type. What I also experienced was urine sitting on top of the litter. Tried this on a whim because of the price, what a waste. TIP: I have recently purchased Meijer's store band scoopable litter and found it to be the best I have ever used, even better than Fresh Step. It clumps into a mass and scoops out easily. Not sure what to think about the good reviews here but can say my experience was not the same."
51270,0,"I am an avid flea comber for our 2 cats (DSH) and short-haired dog. I can be a bit vigorous at times chasing down those pesky fleas. The tines on this comb were a bit too sharp and thin, and would actually bend and break off while I combed, scratching the poor critters. They would cringe or just run & hide when they saw me reach for it. I finally tossed it and bought one with shorter tines and more rounded tips. The pets seem pleasantly surprised. If you're a vigorous comber, watch out."
35601,2,"The Fool-A-Bug was no match for California ants. Perhaps there were fewer in this bowl than a regular one, but does it matter if one finds 500 ants in the bowl rather than the usual 1000 or so?However, there is a fix! After much research (and ant filled food bowls) I finally discovered how to defeat the ants. (See photo above.) Use the Fool-A-Bug bowl as a base and buy an Anti-Ant bowlIndipets Stainless Steel Anti Ant No skid Dish, 16-Ounce. Set your old regular stainless steel dish inside the Fool-A-Bug. Then fit the Anti-Ant dish bottom into the regular pet dish. After about a year of testing, not a single California ant has made it into my device. It may look a little odd but has the added benefit of reducing strain on the kitties' necks as they eat."
181058,0,I got this thermometer for my first 10 gallon tropical aquarium. It works fine for seeing if the temp is in the proper range (74-82) but is not good if you want a precise reading. One square represents about 3 degrees and there are usually 3 squares lit up (the middle one being the brightest).
124050,1,"I have a large black lab who loves this bed. We've had it for several months and in his 8 years, I think it's probably his favorite bed so far. Mine too. I've tried many kinds and this one is great because it hides his black hair, is soft, durable and washable...sort of. It claims to be washable and while it is, it recommends a front load, commerical washer which I don't have. I washed it in our regular washer and it did fine. It came out a little lumpy but my dog doesn't seem to notice and it still looks nice. Also, we have it on our hardwood floor and it seems to be enough padding for him. But then he also likes to lay on the tile when he's hot."
164716,2,"Received pump after about a week. Worked well out of the box with great water volume, but quit working after only 6 weeks of operation.

117354,0,"I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog. When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6. Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats. Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item. I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats. I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium."

1054,1,"I use this to water feed my small dog, he drinks out of it whenever he likes and I don't have to refill the water for him daily. when I use this, i only need to refill it weekly or every other week. The watch out is not to wait too long to refill, there could be bacteria growing in the water and may not be good for your dog."
70349,2,"I bought this shampoo because it was reasonably priced and I wanted to see if it really worked as good as the reviews said it would.The product shipped really fast and the packaging was great, which made me happy, but when I used the shampoo on my Pomeranian it didn't really work. While it did leave her coat soft and shiny like some of the reviews boasted it also made her smell really bad like a wet dog. Honestly, I wanted to leave a good review on this product but I can't because while it leaves your dog soft it makes them smell so bad you have to mask the odor with a pet cologne."

143107,0,"I have gone through two of these over a 6 year period, so am pretty familiar with the unit. The drawbacks are that it's motor makes an unpleasant and loud grinding noise during normal operation, it's waste receptacle is small (I use a small trash-can liner to line the receptacle--makes it easier and cheaper to change), and unless the litter level is uncomfortably low, the unit will have to make several passes to level it and stop grinding! Not fun at night. There are many times I've stomped downstairs at 3am to fix this mad cycling so I could get some sleep. I'd say it's a good unit for small cats who don't make a lot of urine (my cat is 13 and does). And it's far superior to the Performa Automated Littercare System, which looks better but is atrocious."
90661,1,"Our dog LOVES her Coolaroo Pet Bed. We keep it on the deck where she can watch the squirrels play (and wish she could join them).It has withstood rain, sleet and snow flurries. Washes easily and is so light it can be carried around."

98476,0,"We have two dogs, both 11 months old. I have been using this for a few months now. This seems to irritate their skin and while one seems to hide it since he is completely scared of getting the application, my other dog (a black lab mix) goes crazy after getting this applied on her skin. She runs around and rolls on the ground, trying to get rid of the application. It really doesn't help when she pretty much rubs most of it off. However, I haven't seen any fleas or ticks on them. Still, the initial application seems to be extremely irritating and I had not seen this with Frontline. She then proceeds to ignore me for the whole day for doing this to her. And they still both scratch... a lot.I was hoping they'd get used to this but it seems like it's just too harsh for my dogs."
108960,1,"We have a very stubborn beagle which up to this point has thwarted all of our efforts to train him. By nature, he is a constant barker and quickly learned to bypass the citronella spray collar and was right back to barking. He's also a food hound and can often be found counter surfing. Once we purchased this collar, it wasn't long before he realized his howling days were over...not to mention the counter surfing as well. The only downfall is that the batteries ran out rather quickly, so I'd suggest ordering extras. Although, he's been on his good behavior even though the collar hasn't been on...we just need to keep it on hand though, because it's only a matter of time before he reverts to his old antics."
128243,0,"OK but chewed squirrels ears off first,pulled out stuffing.Eating the cardboard in the bottom of the 'tree' I had to remove that.I use the 'tree' to put other rubber squeaky toys in for her to try to pull out.So I guess it wasn't a complete waste of money."

1768,2,"Guinea pigs should never use wheels or those plastic run around balls, they are EXTREMELY bad for their spines and can cause extreme plysical dammage.

15547,2,"It worked the first time I put it on my dog. You could hear it working. She figured it out within about 3 barks and got the message, so I thought it was a success, but then it never really worked after that. I certainly never heard it again. I tried replacing the batteries twice, but nada. My dog still barks less but is slowly figuring it out that it's not working. I don't know if it's the batteries or the collar (but if I have to replace the batteries after every use it's certainly not worth it.) Anyways I've gone ahead and ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00173CWDW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 mostly because it's rechargable! Hopefully it last longer than this one!!"
140520,1,"This kennel is well built and easily portable. Everything is plastic but the front door, however it doesn't feel cheap. We used this for two of our puppies until they grew out of it, and it's been passed on to a cat owner who is just as satisfied. I could go with or without the compartments on top, but the novelty of being able to store treats was sort of fun."
204711,2,"I bought this carrier for my tom cat who weighs about 20lbs. If you are buying this to accommodate a larger/heavier pet, BE WARNED: the crate will FLEX under their weight. On several occasions, this actually caused the door to open and my cat literally fell out into a parking lot. On the final occasion of using this crate, it flexed and the carry handle on top simply popped out of place. I was at the top of a staircase when this occurred. Can you guess what happened? Yes, my cat, in his carrier, was tossed helplessly end over end down a flight of stairs because this crate does not actually hold up for heavier pets. I am also writing a letter directly to the company to alert them to this flaw in design."

91830,0,"It proved itself very useful, especially once some experience was gained. However:1. The bath-to-drain connection will leak without substantial extra efforts to tighten it up, the recess around drain connection is too narrow, so it is hard to both screw and unscrew it.2. The drain pipe is way too rigid, I had to use weights to keep it down.3. The harness gives too much freedom to a short legged dog."
170962,0,I have a Ford Explorer and it fits tight on my console but otherwise Sophie (my dog) likes it. It seems to be made very well.
69381,1,I like this product. The size was smaller than a human stocking but still big enough to put in treats and decorate a mantle with the others.

90198,0,"I've been using this for a long time with 6 cats in the house and I think it clumps really well. The reason I'm looking for a new brand, however, is because the smell is really getting to me. It's bad enough to smell the pee/poop smells, but when you layer a perfume-y smell on top of that it almost makes it worse. This heavy scent doesn't smell natural to me. I wish they made it in unscented, I'd probably stick with it. Are you listening, Nature's Miracle? Unscented, please. I do like that it's biodegradable. It tends to track a bit, but because it's such a good clumper I ignored the tracking. If it came in an unscented version, I'd give it 4 stars. Enzymes are good, as long as they're unscented.UPDATE: I finally found a new brand and I like it much better. See my review for World's Best Multicat with ""wow"" as the review title."
147098,2,"I bought this to replace the one we had, as the flap had cracked. I wanted the same model and size, so it would fit the hole in the door w/o modifications. Picture looked the same, measurements were too, so I ordered it. What the description lacked is that it is not made for doors that lead to the outside. This one has no weather stripping (hair-like brushes) like the old one. So as I write this, we are experiencing a extreme cold snap here in Washington. Cold air is streaming in!"

178285,0,"This ""box"" did stop the problem where one of my cats was sticking his rear out of one of the old boxes to urinate. That's why I purchased.However, unless you are very diligent about clearing the ""steps"" after almost every use, litter is still tracked out quite a bit.The rounded sides make it difficult to use a traditional flat edged scooper to clean when using clumping litter. I find it necessary to lift the plastic liner to roll litter & clumps away from the sides to scoop.Booda Dome Clean Step Liners, 8-PackI keep out two boxes side by side. Wish the made a mirror version so I could more easily set two of this style side by side in the space I have available."
178932,2,"I definitely think it's a cool concept, but I really would like to point out that it's far from being perfect. First off, like many other reviews have mentioned, the plastic used is really thin, even though it's supposed to encourage the cats 'moving toward the rim', it in fact discourages the kitties from using it. Secondly, the entire process is gross. Your bathroom will be much messier than usual for an unknown amount of time. You will wonder whether clay or pine or any other form of litter is a good choice for these months, and you will realize they are all equally failed choices. Yes, months. You wll be forced to scoop urine soaked litter from this cheap and shaky plastic and wiping your toilet seats, everyday. It absolutey takes more than a week or two weeks for kitties to get used to any 'ring stage'. So, expect plenty of accidents. Even if your cats CAN use the toilet, it doesn't mean they will find it convenient to use or use it every time. I have a pair of kittens 7 month ish old when I started the training. They are both using the toilet now. But many hilarious, costly and frustrating accidents have happened. The latest one was when the smarter cat started peeing in bathtub near the sink hole. I blame the toilet training for this. Asking the cats to use human toilet is a lot. It's not natural for them to pee in water, unlike what the training guide that comes along with the product would like you to believe. Cats like seeing their poop and pee well covered. Overall, you should be very pessimistic and stubborn about this training process to even be partially successful. Do not believe most of the cleverly marketed training guide which is way too optimistic, apart from the beginning when it suggests that you move the original litter box slowly toward the bathroom in a week."
46004,1,"Halloween is a time for spooks and treats. It's a time for ghosts, witches and goblins. Should humans be the only ones who get to dress up for this terrifying event? Of course not. That's why I purchased this adorable DOGZILLA costume for my puppy dog. His name is Professor Xavier and he looks cute, maybe a little too cute. What a muffin. When the trick-or-treaters knock on my door, I let the dog answer the door. While the kids are admiring him, I jump out in my witch costume with an axe and I scream at the top of my lungs to scare them away. I guess it would be scary since I'm an overweight man but it's a good way to keep all the candy for myself."
131715,1,"using it while clicker training my cats! it's a really nice size for them, since they don't go thru treats like dogs do. everything i saw in stores was WAY too big. i never close up the drawstring, so can't comment on that. but definitely nice option if your looking for something smaller."
207917,0,"So far, the Zodiac flea collars work okay. They were thinner than I thought they were going to be. The question is: will they work the length of time stated?

99428,2,"Our's lasted for 8 months and then the motor died right before we were going out of town. I ran to the a nearby pet store to pick up a new one. Out of the box the new one was defective. The feeder would only rotate half way and then get stuck. I ran back to the pet store, exchanged it and the new one was also defective! Same problem. So I picked up a PetSafe 2-Meal feeder and this has worked well, so far. (No motors or rotating with this one). There is a silver lining. The feeder has a one-year warranty. I called PetSafe and they sent me a new feeder, virtually no questions asked. I didn't even have to return the broken one. In summary, I'd still buy one (it seems to be one of the best feeders out there). Just keep an eye on it and have someone drop by your home while your gone to make sure it is working."
130209,1,I ordered this crate for our dog to be shipped to us across the country. I had to ask a friend to drill holes in the back for required 4-sided ventilation and to replace the plastic fasteners with metal ones. It is definitely solid and otherwise worked to get her to us safely.
111165,0,"I'm not an aspen bedding expert. This is only the second bag I've purchased. I thought these were more like shavings. They have the texture of chips with shredded sharp edges. If I had to live and sleep on this stuff I'd be full of wood slivers. The last brand I bought was Harlan Sani-chips which was much more to my liking. They were wood shavings, softer w/o the sharp splintered edges. Looks like Harlan was just bought out so I hope the new owners are putting out the same product because I'm ordering a bag. I'm not buying another bag of Kaytee.11-28-11I'm going to suck it up and say that my opinion of the Kaytee litter has improved. The critters (dwarf hamsters) love to burrow into it and make nests out of it which they can't do w/ the Sani-Chips. So in the future I'll buy some of both since the critters give them both a thumbs up for different reasons."
94117,0,"I have tried several types of filters for my red eared slider and this has kept the tank the cleanest, however its really hard to take it apart to clean it and the filters dont last more than one time before the fall apart. My red eared slider is in a 65 gallon tank now as she has grown very big, about large lunch plate size and its necessary to clean out the filter at least once or twice a week. I found its less expensive to buy the disposable filter pack for a different brand of filter and take out the plastic holder, fold up the cotton pouch and use that. I havent been able to find replacement white filter ""absorbers""? that go on the one side but have been changing the blue sponge about every 3-4 weeks. there are basically three componets to the filter system, the carbon bag, the blue sponge filter and the white circular stone type things that go under the carbon pouch. So in addition to the filter you will need to buy these items too. Overall my biggest complaint is its VERY difficult to get the thing open to clean it."

37237,0,I bought this mat for my cat because he is such a slob. It contains most of his mess but now he has taken it upon himself to pick out each piece of food individually and still eat it on the carpet. *Sigh* At least it gets some of the food!

163255,0,Very attractive for large spaces however our pet could get out of it easily. My husband attached it to the wall with hooks that close. That made it more functional. Without attaching it to the wall it would not have been worth the purchase due to our smart pet.
1125,2,"I bought the LeBistro Portion Control Feeder and for the first 12 feeding times at breakfast and lunch it worked like a champ. Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost. Pretty easy to set up.But intermittent behavior defeats the purpose of being able to leave with confidence."
25205,0,"Bought this pump to run threee 16"" bubble walls in my 90 gallon freshwater aquarium. My old pump barely produced any bubbles. After initially installing the Aqueon Coralife Super Luft Air Pump, I thought my tank was going to explode there were so many bubbles...this lasted for about two days. After that, I was back to normal and it is barely producing any bubbles...It is decently quiet and probably suitable for normal applications, but not nearly worth the money for deep water or high capicity needs."

100951,0,"I like the fact that the construction of the spade and scoop is something that is designed to resist weathering for quite some time, a combination of aluminum and fiberglass. However, I have a problem with the joining of the only two adjacent metal parts, namely the shaft and scoop parts. The two parts are joined with a sheet-metal screw that is loose and cannot be tightened. I feel that it's only a matter of time before the two parts irrevocably separate because of metal fatigue. Too bad because the overall design is good."

37728,2,"Great concept, but as others have pointed out, the execution is flawed. The item is huge but usable space for the cats is cramped so our two weren't very fond of it (and these aren't fussy cats). Unless you roll it several times a day, the scoop drawer overflows and spills litter all over as you pull it out, so you have to hold a garbage bag under it when emptying. The plastic fasteners holding the unit together were weak and easily slid into the unlocked position, so we narrowly avoided a few disasters until we learned to double check them each time we rolled it. We'd read numerous glowing reviews of this product and ended up being so disappointed that we went back to a conventional litter box after a few weeks. Less hassle for us, and the cats were happier. No wonder the price keeps dropping.... I'd love to see them (or someone else) improve on it - perhaps I'd try ""Version 2.0""."
126365,0,"It was smaller than I hoped, but since the dimensions were included with the description, that was my fault. The top door, which is very helpful with putting a cat in the carrier, is hard to open and close, which is why I only gave it a 3 star rating."
96388,0,These are excellent guides for the novice & home groomer. The quality of the plastic could be better & the attachment clips are made of inferior metal. I would not expect them to last if they were used heavily. I could expect to get a reasonable amount of use out of these combs/guides.
137335,0,"I purchased these diapers for a 40-lb female dog who experiences excessive flow during heat. As she is still a young dog, she remains quite active and I'm sorry to report that the tabs that are supposed to hold these diapers around the dog's waist can't handle her activity. These would probably be perfect as is for older, less active dogs, but I have had to resort to good old duct tape in order to keep her in her diapers. I basically cut a length long enough to go around her waist, and after I've put on the diaper and attached the tabs, I use the duct tape like a belt to reinforce the tabs. It works great and she seems completely comfortable.One more problem solved by duct tape.Other than the fit issue, these diapers are perfect for a dog in heat."

17552,0,"When I got my dog -- a 95-lb lab mix -- from the shelter, he was practically perfect in every way. Except one. As soon as I left my apartment, he would bark. Nonstop. Which, obviously, was not okay for my neighbors. Because the barking was due to anxiety, I was hesitant to use any sort of negative training to stop it, so anti-bark collars were one of my last resorts. Instead, I focused on anti-anxiety tools and training: I started incremental training where I would leave the apartment for just a short while at a time and then return to demonstrate that it was okay for me to leave. I got him on aD.A.P. Collar. I played himcanine relaxation music. I got him aThundershirt. It worked. A little. After several weeks of training and various tools he had gone from barking for hours on end to finally settling down after 30-60 minutes of barking. Still not good enough. I would love to give him the time he needs to work out his anxiety, but the neighbors are not so forgiving, and I can't blame them. It was time to take things to the next level. I tried anultrasonic bark controldevice. No dice. He was briefly puzzled and then simply ignored it. Finally I tried this product.It worked.Immediately.When I stepped out of my apartment after putting it on, he barked once. Had a few seconds of silence. Barked a couple more times. Fell silent. Whined a little bit. Didn't bark anymore. Now, three days later, I'm sure he's still anxious when I leave, but he no longer vocalizes about it. I'm sorry for him, but no longer have to deal with the tremendous guilt and anxiety of my own from leaving a barking dog behind in my apartment whenever I have to go out. As far as that goes, this device delivered.If he learns he can bark this collar out, or if it stops working, I'll update this review, but for now I'm happy to fully recommend this product.EDIT: This device did its job perfectly for four days. On day five, my dog decided that it wasn't even going to slow him down anymore, let alone stop his barking. I suspect that it's a useful training tool to curb excited barking, but as an anti-anxious-barking solution it will likely have only limited success."

216933,0,"We have several different feeders going with lots of experience. This is a durable feeder but our birds consistently consider this feeder a last resort (when the others happen to be empty or too many are fighting over the others or when the rufus is active). Maybe if the glass was red, it would help. I don't know. Feeders that look like flowers like the perky pet varieties are excellent, first nature is good but you can also get it at wal-mart, ""more birds"" glass one is great if you need 32 oz. Our two cents on it. Have fun!"

I was hoping for more immediate results. I am not giving up on it yet though. Still hopeful. You CAN NOT use the bottle with any other diffusers. That was one of my original plans - buy it, try it, test it, see if I can use the refills with other plug in diffusers. Nope. So just know that if you buy this you probably won't see immediate changes."
44632,2,"I got this automatic water bowl for my 20 pound dachshund, Pickles, because I liked the fact that it said it would circulate the water. It, however, would barely move the water with its weak and basically useless pump.The pump never had the power to produce much of a stream of water and it would randomly make a ton of loud noises.It was a pain to clean and basically needed to be disassembed and reassembled each time to clean it properly.The pump totally stopped working after a little more than 2 months. It would be nice to sell something that does what it says and to a normal standard.My husband always hated it for some reason and said it was 'evil' and 'going to burn down our house one day' I thought that was a little dramatic but it never impressed him.I felt it is a good idea cause I hate to see stagnant water in Pickles' water bowl but they need to redesign the pump with one that actually works since most people are probably buying it for the pump.Be wary and be forewarned!"
2787,0,"Pretty much as my title says. The product itself is ""ok"" but i dont think it should be worth 10 dollars.

134891,0,"I have purchased two of these items (EHEIM 2213 Canister Filter) from Amazon in the last couple months. No complaints concerning shipping or price. The units arrived quickly. As I installed the first unit I found that the plastic cover to the inner media holder (eheim pn 2600130) was broken along the outline of the screen. Iritating but not worth returning the whole thing after the work getting it installed. The unit works whisper quiet and a huge step up from my rear mounted unit. Being somewhat satisfied with that I ordered a second unit for my other tank. I check the media container prior to install and was happy to see no damage and it seemed like everything was ok. But, again during final install, while closing the unit up, one of the plastic hinges on the outer casing cracked off (eheim pn 7273010). The pin for the hinge was still working so I kept going with the install. This unit is noticably noisier than the first unit. Not loud just not whisper quiet. I hope that it just needs a breakin period. However, after opening and closing the unit again, more of the hinge broke and now there is a crack in the casing. I would rather not return the whole unit for just one part, but I don't see a choice right now. Overall, I love the units, I just wish that they had a more uniform build quality and that I didn't have to return the whole unit just to get a single part that should have been good in the first place."

13609,0,"I &#34;had&#34; been using Natures Miracle pads and my two 8 week old Chihuahua's used them 95% of the time. The good reviews of Four Paws wee wee pads made me order the big 150 box. I put One Natures Miracle down and one Four paws pad down and they kept going to the Natures Miracle Pad. Personally I love the Four Paws - I love the big size - you really need a lot of room for the pups - even at 2 pounds... and they are thick/quilted.... I'm baffled in why my pups prefer the Natures Miracle pads tho'. They are doing so good at house breaking at their young ages. They know when we go out - which we go A LOT - what to do! They are getting the idea, but I like using pee pads - for emergencies - cause you can't catch them all the time. Maybe if Four Paws would add the sent of &#34;GRASS&#34; to their pads along with the other smell they put in there, it would be the perfect pad. But it is very interesting and I'd suggest people buy the different pads and just watch and see which ones the pups go to the most."
119128,1,"My dog is a serious chewer. He actually eats bedding we put in his crate so we had to purchase a high quality Kuranda bed that he can't get his teeth into. Toys can be a problem. I've found Nylabones work very well for him. He has several styles, including this one and loves them. I give him one at night when he is put in his crate and also when he needs something constructive to do during the day. He will often go to his crate, pull out the Nylabone to carry it to where he wants to lounge at the moment. I would definitely recommend this for heavy chewers. We haven't had a problem with Regal breaking off pieces to swallow, but it's always a good idea to supervise any new toy with your dog before giving free access to it. All dogs are different. For Regal, this works and has lasted well."

21248,0,"On my ten pound cat, the mediums were way, WAY too big. She pulled them off, gnawed at them and generally hated life. I kept finding chunks of fingernails glued to the inside of the Soft Claws I'd find strewn all over the floors each morning. I bought a small set, even though she's clearly out of that range and I find them to work much better. She can't get them off and they've lasted a week and a half thus far, versus the one day I got out of the mediums.Remember the cat's claws retract, so the Soft Claws should not cover the entire nail when you have the nail fully extended. If you do, when the nails retract, the Soft Claw will cover the cat's soft cuticle and irritate it. I found this out the hard way when MeowMeow would go crazy when I tried to inspect the nails she'd gotten the Soft Claw off of- the nail itself was ripped in almost 2, was ragged down to the quick and the cuticle was inflamed. With the smalls, since they only go about 2/3 of the way up her nail when extended, they seem to be perfect when she retracts them. Much happier kitty, much less guilt from me."

174060,1,"I have a dog that is capable of destroying anything and everything that can be chewed on, rammed with his fat block head, or drug across any open space. With jaws that rival a car crusher, it can make it hard to find a suitable toy that can not only put up with his waves of destruction, but he will enjoy as well.This is by no short stretch my dog's #1 possession. He LOVES his Kong with a passion only rivaled by pizza and belly rubs! And it can take all the punishment he can dish out. It does need replacing but usually around the 1 year mark instead of many toys, only lasting a day or, at best, a week. He plays catch with it, tug of war with it, and just chews for hours on this poor little chew thing.Brutus is an American Staffordshire Terrier, or pit bull type, so he is a very strong chewer. If you have a pit type or other breed that is a power chewer, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the black Kong's!"
149144,2,"I adopted two shelter kittens (they're about three months old now; pretty large) that turned out to have fleas, so I bought two of these traps to help control the bugs in the cats' favorite areas while Frontline kills off the ones on their bodies. The problem is, it's as if whoever designed this trap has no idea where fleas come from and tend to reside.If you're shopping for a flea trap, you probably have some sort of pet, right? And if you have a pet, that animal is probably curious, has paws smaller than three inches across, and doesn't understand simple directions such as, ""Don't stick your paws in the new brightly lit warm thing, silly.""Even though it's summer, my cats like to nap and play right next to this toasty device, and eventually one of them happens to get his paws or tail into the almost totally open-sided trap and onto the glue pad. One kitten flipped out and dragged the trap halfway through the apartment before I caught up and unstuck his tail. The other sat placidly, not moving while I pried both his front paws off the glue. Either way, it's an undesirable outcome, and this seems to me to be a pretty ridiculous design flaw.So now I have traps that I can't use in the areas where the cats--and their fleas--actually hang out, unless I sit nearby constantly, ready to unstick them at a moment's notice. Can't use them at night, obviously. And meanwhile, the active trap (I'm using only one now, since I must be present), has caught exactly one bug, which was not even a flea. Pointless."

I ordered the Scoop-Free self-cleaning litter box to make litter cleanup less of an issue. I did find the litter box to be everything I wanted for my end of the job. It was easy to maintain, as you aren't continually scooping litter. It was cleaner, as the litter tended not to track out of the box. The odor control was much better than our old regular scoopable litter box. The issue was that the cats hated it. My female quit using the box completely after 2 weeks and decided my family room carpet was a better litter box (to the point of I had to have the carpet replaced). I got the impression she didn't like the crystals as much as regular scoopable litter. She would go in the box and shake her feet the entire time she was in it. My male cat was obsessed with the sweeper. I tried adjusting the timer to the full 20 minutes & he would sit by the box, staring at it until the sweeper started moving. He would then swat at it while hissing and growling. I went back to a regular box with scoopable litter.

96674,1,"This is another ball on the short list (see my reviews) of toys my industrial chewer can't quickly destroy, but it's probably ours & her least favorite. My dog spends a lot of her free time indoors (to prevent my yard from being chewed/eaten), and when my girl plays with this ball, it is very loud on our floating floors because it's heavy. She prefers her other more flexible toys over this one. Still a keeper though, since it hasn't been destroyed!"
90052,0,"We bought the Large size - it's far too small for our 70 lb Bernese Mountain Dog. Even with the strap extended to it's largest size, it's quite snug (it's a stretchy material). The hat itself also appears more like a paper party hat, due to its small size, than a santa hat.Also, there are logos front and back on this hat - a paw print on one side, and a brand logo on the other. They're embroidered, and large enough to detract from the appearance of the hat."
177844,0,"the bedding seems to be of decent quality, the only issue i see is some of the points can be quite sharp, which concerns me. there is also some cheaper bedding by kaytee and you can even buy it at places for livestock, sold as ""animal bedding."" just make sure it is kiln-dried."

4451,1,"Lewis and his brothers have gone through 3 of the ""crackler"" frogs. The frog is the only one of ""fat cat toys"" that they truly enjoy. I think it may have something to do with the positioning of the frog's legs and the fact that it's not so bulky in the middle, making it easy for the boys to grasp. Unfortunately, I have not found the frog in stores for a few years, therefore am resulting in ordering the frog online."
174610,0,"I installed this around my house for my 2 small dogs. The installation was easy as I had an edger to cut a line in the grass and used a shovel to cut into the ground at an angle, then lifted the ground and shoved the wire in. Although I only used about 3/4 of the roll of wire, there were not enough flags so I had to buy extra flags at a local pet store. If you have any kind of sizable area (5000 sq. ft or more), the wire may be enough, but think about ordering EXTRA FLAGS.Installation and hooking up to the control unit was relatively easy and took about 4 hours with edging, wire installation, and flag insertion. I installed the fence in a ""square"" area around my property, crossing my driveway at an expansion joint (concrete driveway). The control unit is mounted in my garage.I'm currently training according to the included CD, which is a critical part of successfully using this type of fence. The collar unit is just the right size for my 15lb shihtzu, but is slightly big for my 9lb chihuahua...I wish they made more streamlined/smaller collar units that work with this system, but after reading reviews of other systems and how often batteries had to be replaced (proprietary, nonetheless), I thought having rechargable collars would be much more convenient.I ordered this package and also an additional collar since I have 2 dogs. The collar that came with the package was DOA, but the extra collar I ordered worked right out of the box, even though it was low on charge. The instructions stated to charge the collar for at least 14hrs initially. I had the defective collar on the charger for almost 20 hours, and it would not take a charge (green light didn't blink on the defective collar, but working collar was blinking red indicating low charge). I reported this to Amazon, and they sent out another whole package with next day delivery at no charge, and I swapped out the collars. Thanks Amazon, although you could have just sent out an extra collar package and I could have swapped it with that instead, saving you on shipping costs!What could be better?1. More flags2. Containment area setting (how close to the wire before collars ""fire"") isn't very precise...at minimum the collar will fire 2-3"" from the wire, anything more than minimum setting it will fire 12"" from the wire...not very precise.3. More streamlined collars/smaller units4. Only 2 settings for shock level...low is too low, high is too high (I tested it on myself, not my dogs since we're only training without shocks at this time).5. Installation instructions could be more descriptive.With that said, for the price, this system is a pretty complete package and installation should be easy for those do-it-yourself types."
81602,1,It is well made and much better than the one I bought through Cabellas. The dogs do not slide around like on the thin nylon covers. I put it in a full size truck and my only complaint is that I wish it were about6 inches wider. It does not quite cover the edges of the rear seat.
125827,0,"Her urine rapidly spreads across the pad and onto her feet. I've used pads that did a better job of catching the urine and keeping her clean, but those were from Japan and I don't know how to get them here.Occasionally the borders cannot contain the fluid properly, and the floor will get wet.I toss them after one use.If I didn't know how good pads can be, I might feel better about these, but these are definitely not the best."
206676,0,"I thought that this would be a lot of fun, but it was kind of a disappointment. We have an Austrailian Shepard-Autrailian Cattle Dog mix who loves to jump and play and is pretty high energy. He was interested in this only for a few minutes and did not seem to like the taste much. Also, it has kind of a strange smell, and if you don't get a bubble blower with it, you have to put your finger in the solution to use the bubble wand."
146339,0,It's lightweight and convienent to use. I just used in once so far but cut my dogs coat way too short and it looked awful and quite choppy and uneven. I'm hoping the second time with a longer attachement will be successful. I think it was 'operators' error not the clipper. Time will tell next time I use it.
176702,0,"Ball does not deflate, and is a wonderful ball. Handle is of the same material, just more dense, and a 26 pound cocker spaniel chewed off the handle with his sharp teeth. The handle needs to be made of a tougher stuff, though the ball part is fine. The cocker loved it for the handle, but it didn't last a week. So overall, I liked the flexibility of the ball, but the handle just couldn't take it. I purchased two, the largest and the next to largest. The cocker wanted the largest one, for 26 pounds he is quite the tough little guy, he is vision impaired and loved the bigger ball he could see, and he could carry it, until he ate the handle off."
59054,1,Excellent buy for the product. You cannot beat the price. I searched all over the Internet before I found this good bargain.
161661,1,"I bought this clicker along with Christine Dahl's ""Good Dog 101"" book. At first I didn't think the clicker was all that useful, but after a couple of days of just clicking then treating my Mini Schnauzer realized that the click meant she gets a treat. Once that was understood it was a matter of a couple of 10 minute training sessions before she learned to sit and ""go home"" (get in your crate). She still doesn't like to go to her crate when it's not bedtime, but she's getting better. Sometimes I'll say go home and she just looks at it and back at me, but at least I know she understands the phrase.As far as construction, the clicker seems like it will last a while. A couple of times I've kind of half clicked and it gets stuck depressed, but if you fiddle a little it pops back out.Overall, great training device and a good clicker."
213855,0,"A pretty collar for a special dog but a little on the heavy side. I've toyed with keeping it or sending it back but think I'll hang onto it and try it when my dog is a little bigger. Right now it just seems too bulky for a 6 month old goldendoodle puppy. Other than that, the built-in leash is a very nice feature."
61172,2,"i am disappointed with this product. Too expensive and clearly designed for ease of production and not for your animal.The filler is all center mass. The sowing that holds the filler is sewn in at the base. So one matter that size dog, the dog will be laying on a lump. Other positive reviews I saw must have been written by the vendor."
79351,0,"I did not purchase this gate from Amazon, but from my local pet store about a week ago. It was hidden in the back and I thought it perfect for blocking my rabbit while still allowing the cats access from room to room. The guy at the pet store even gave me 10% off. What a deal, I thought. However, when I got the gate home I realized why he gave me the money off. It was missing parts! Oh wait no, it wasn't missing parts! The bumpers just don't actually work. The holes are drilled too big, and while you can kinda mess around with it and wedge it into place, it can be very frustrating when the bumper just spins and spins, or locks up. I assumed that I was missing some sort of seat or base for the bumper screw to set into, but after doing some online research this does not seem to be the case. Overall, it looks nice, better than those ugly mesh plastic ones, the size is fantastic for walking over while still effectively blocking small animals. I love the little door... its so cute, as well as being convenient. The gate is adjustable by about 1/2 inch increments, and when you can effectively wedge the bumpers in place, its a nice tight fit that leaves no marks on the walls. Overall, it gets a 3 star, because messing with the bumpers is such a hassle! Its a good product but could be made better by fixing the free spinning bumper issue."
81356,1,"My dog loves these, and I like that they are all natural. I like the tiny size so he can have one everytime he comes back into the house after being out, but because they are small he doesn't get a lot of added calories. I use the largest size as his &#34;big bone treat&#34; when he comes in for the last time at night."

188993,0,I recently used two of these bags to transport cats cross country on JetBlue. No one batted an eye at the size of the bag and most didn't even notice we had animals with us. They fit under the seat with only a little squeezing in the height dimension. They were plenty sturdy in most respects but one of the cats scratched through the mesh used for the windows. The cat could easily have increased the size of the hole and caused problems so I ended up having to lean over and pet her frequently to keep her agitated digging at the bag to a minimum. Overall the bags worked for us but I was disappointed in how easily the cats were able to damage them. Maybe they work better with dogs or people with a loooooong time to train the cats to get used to the bags. We didn't have zipper problems but our vet suggested using paper clips to clip the zipper pulls together so the cats couldn't work their way out.
174923,0,"I'm a first-time dog owner, so maybe I'm missing something...but this doesn't work well for me. Yes, it attracts some hair, but it also sends hair flying all over the place. You're supposed to brush it in circles and that just sends loose hair all over, instead of clinging to the brush ""like a magnet"" as it says it will. I should have just used a standard brush, and then the Furminator (which is awesome).Pro - my dog loves being brushed with it!"
93323,0,Didn't really work for my dog - he has anxiety issues that are manifested through excessive barking. I figured the collar was worth a try.

27441,2,This unit was used on a 7 pound poodle. Who ever designed this item did a horrible job. The collar is heavy stiff rubber and does not swivel at the connections to the unit. the result is the collar stands out away from the dogs neck and will not stay centered. The unit has three projections that are supposed to touch the dogs neck. The way it is designed one of the end contacts is always held away from neck. We clipped the hair down to the skin and the result was still a failure. My dog has worn this all day for quite a few days and never once has there been a correction. This is a piece of junk! Save your money
163864,0,"I purchases the largest flying chuckit squirrel for my 80 pound black lab, Hanska. The arrival date was perfect, however the first day (arrival day) Hanska chewed right through its leg-exposing the interior of the product-but loved it! On day 2, we went to the park and the squirrel flew so well that it sailed over the parks new fence and got swallowed but by the new deep sod. We were not able to get the squirrel because the new fence was fenced off to protect the sod.Is there a way that we can get a replacement?

43972,0,When I first started to use the diffusers...I have 2 in my home...I thought it seemed to be helping with cats anxiety and spraying. After four months I have replaced them 3 times and don't see any improvement in my two cats. I wish it had worked as we have been in this house for a year and I fear it may smell when we have visitors. I use alot of candles!!

8039,0,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this car seat. It looks nice and it serves its purpose. My dog doesn't seem thrilled by it if he's excited, but he does seem to enjoy sleeping in it once he's calmed down. This thing is HUGE - definitely something to keep in mind if you drive a car as opposed to a van or SUV. I am able to wedge it into the backseat of my Regal - but it is wider than a single seat in back, it fits much better in my husbands Taurus. Also because of the massive size of this thing I can't even open and close the drawer in it because it is butted up against the front seat essentially."
158391,2,I paid full price and received a used product. Very dissapointing. Packaging had been opened previously and taped back closed. Product looks obviously used.

I ordered this item for a 9 hour car trip coming up this weekend. Disappointed! Poor customer service and not great marketing strategy!"

63005,0,"Because these collars are round, they're reflective from every angle, which is great. And when I say ""reflective"", I mean reallyREALLY reflective, which is also great. The reflective tape is woven through the whole collar, and there's lots of it, so it really picks up the light when I'm out walking my dogs at night.I would've given them a perfect rating, except for the fact that the collars are a lot bigger than they're supposed to be. The size is stated as 19""-24"", but even when it's buckled at the tightest notch, the collar is still a little over 27"", which is so big that they can slide easily over the heads of my two 75-lb Golden Retrievers. So it's a great collar for night-safety purposes, but really bad for dog-restraint purposes.The collars so inexpensive that it didn't seem worth the trouble to return them, so when I take the dogs out at night, I just slip the reflective collars on along with their regular collars, kind of like a necklace rather than a dog collar, which actually works pretty well. So overall, I'd recommend the collars pretty highly - just order a size a lot smaller than you think you'll need, or plan to use it mainly as a decorative accessory."

I only allowed my dog to have the bone for about an hour at a time three days in a row. He loved it & by the third night, was begging for it. Unfortunately, it was very easy for him to break pieces off the bone.

16417,0,"I have a large female Boxer & this collar did not deter her from running into my living room with muddy paws. She just charges right through the barrier zone with minimal correction as the corrections progress from a beep, to a mild then a stronger correction. She only feels the strongest corrections which she has to be within range for at least a minute in order for them to occur. So as far as using it as a doorway barrier to a room it does not work. She just sprints on through with no penalty.In another situation it did work well. She likes to charge & repeatedly ram into my back door. I set the sensor in between the back door & the screen door & it worked like a charm. Because it was inside the door & therefore making the door a shock zone she did not once come near that door & spent a good part of the day outside enjoying the beautiful spring weather!On another note because Boxers have sensitive skin she had a pretty bad allergic reaction to the collar after only wearing it loosely around her neck for about 4 hours. So keep an eye on the contact points & watch for any adverse reactions."

I brushed my cat for 2 min in the same spot, and saw all the hair, but when I looked at the coat compared to the non brushed side I was shocked! The inner hairs where all gone and left with only gard hairs! IE same as just a plain plastic raincoat! Brrrrr! Now he doesn't want to go outside (outdoor indoor) even though our climate is mild. He notices the diffrence when this last winter he was A-OK with the 2 feet of snow. I'm glad it grows back, but don't spend to much time in the same area!I'm not using mine again! Poor kitty. He looks thinner and his coat is way less shiny than it use to be. I'm ok with a little bit of cat hair. Just let it fall out naturally. It releases oils for thier coat when it does."

The spring also doesn't look like it would handle any real tug by our 70 lb. hound.This is what happens when a company doesn't have the ethical backbone to spend 50 cents extra for decent steel and hardware to ensure your dog doesn't break loose and run off.Do not buy this product. Buy coated cable and go to the local hardware store and buy decent hardware and do it yourself, its pretty easy."

The inner mesh is also very flimsy and you will tear it taking the cover off and on. All in all the bed is good but has a lot of room for improvement before its worth the price."

78354,2,I have had several algae scrapers through the years and this is far and away the worst. What makes or brakes these scrapers is the head that holds the straight blade. This scraper does not properly hold the blade which results in the blade often times getting covered or so loose that you can't scrape anything but the very thinnest of films off of your tank. If you are thinking of buying a scraper..... buy a different one.

I took her to the vet and after about $300 later I found out she'sreally sensitive and the Lupine collars are the only ones that she doesn't have a reaction to. In addition to this, I don't know any other company that offers a lifetime warranty even if the product is chewed! The collars are made extremely well, not cheap at all! and I honestly don't think I would ever have to use their warranty for anything other than my dogs chewing it."
56677,0,"Mrs. Spudman picked up a bag of this canine treat because it was on sale. I don't think Beggin Strips are much of a deal at any price. Just read the list of ingredients. It's a wheat/corn product with a little bit of bacon and cheese far down on the ingredient list. There was a time when most of the dog treat products were of this low caliber. Today there are far better choices with more wholesome ingredients and even real meat listed first.Beggin Treats are soft and easy to break into small pieces. Our dogs do seem to enjoy this offering, but in the world of dog snacks, this one resides near the bottom of my list, a treat I wouldn't consider no matter the price."
183262,0,"After reading such glowing reviews as ""best toy ever"" I decided to give this a shot. My large dog needs sturdy toys, and this one does NOT fill the bill. About five minutes after removing this from the package to play tug with it, pieces started falling off. Not a good start. The toy is large but not durable, and not worth the money."

216452,1,"I have read a few reviews on this item and I have to chime in.First of all, if you can't handle noisy toys, this ball might not be for you (Then again, if you can't handle nosie around the house, why do you have a dog anyway? Buy a goldfish.).If, however, your goal is provide your puppy with a toy that will delight him or her for hours and hours on end, then this ball IS for you. The babble ball speaks crazy little phrases when agitated. ""Hello, puppy!"" ""What you doing?"" ""Hot Diggity Dog"" etc. My Cairn Terrier loves to put one of her stuffed animals in her mouth and bat the babble ball around my living room. She paws at it (like a cat!) when it gets stuck behind something and she cries if she loses it under the couch.She is SO in love with it that she's worn out EIGHT of these balls (over the last two years) and is on her ninth.During the winter, she doesn't get as much outdoor exercise and this ball has been a great way for her to play indoors. We play fetch when I have time and when I don't, she plays with it on her own.It's fantastic.BTW - My parents bought one for their dog too (mini schnauzer) and she LOVES it as well.Your dog will thoroughly enjoy this toy. It's been my dog's favorite for YEARS now."
180343,1,"Having a digital lcd readout of temperature that is quickly viewable is very nice. As for the accuracy, after some testing I am fairly confident that my unit is within a degree of accuracy. I saw a comment from someone else that is very true and amusing: &#34;If you have only one thermometer you know exactly what the temperature is. If you have more than one thermometer, then not so sure&#34;. My previous stick-on strip thermometer (on my 75 gal tank) was reading 78 degrees and the dial on my heater said it was set to 79 degrees. When I installed this new thermometer it registered 83 degrees! I thought that this unit was faulty. I then did some experimenting. Using a digital cooking thermometer and also a digital thermometer for outside reading, I found that these were reading 82 and 83 degrees. I then placed the probes in ice water and saw that they all read close to 32 degrees (the coralife read 32.8). This latter test is not conclusive as to the accuracy in the 80 degree range since the linearity of the device is not known, however it does provide additional credibility to its accuracy. So why the discrepancy between the stick-on strip and the digital thermometers? The stick-on strip is on the outside of the tank. From what I have read, there should not be much of a temperature gradient from the liquid on the inside and the outside, but I have not researched this enough to know exactly what the difference would be. (I need to dust off my old thermodynamics book from college!). I suspect on smaller tanks with thinner glass, this temperature gradient is much less and therefore the reading more accurate. Maybe with the larger tanks and thicker glass, these become less accurate. Not sure, however I feel fairly confident that this new unit is reasonably accurate and my tank inhabitants are thanking me fo it."

41113,1,"I'm very pleased with this product. I was expecting at least a hint of a fishy odor, but I smell absolutley nothing. I used to have to put some canned food on my dog's dry food in order for him to eat it, but a couple pumps of this and he gobbles up the entire bowl. Canned food is mostly moisture anyway and a waste of money. No need for it now.I'm very impressed with the amount of Omega-3's per serving. Based on 2.5 pumps (for a 25 lb. dog), it has a total of 1319mg Omega-3 fatty acids. 500mg DHA, and 455mg EPA (the good stuff). That's more than most human fish oil supplements per serving. I'd been giving him cheap fish oil pills for human consumption but this seems to be a superior product that will last quite a while based on 2.5 pumps per day."

47772,0,"Simple design but has a flaw that you may not notice unless pointed out. If you don't mind excessive amounts of uneaten seed all around your feeder this isn't even a flaw. If you look at the picture where the chickadee's are you may notice that where the seed falls out is a trough of sorts. The trough is basically the outer edge of the bottom board of the feeder. The board has ""trim"" that makes a lip so the seed doesn't spill out immediately. What they forgot was a lip on either end by the suet feeder. I simply cut a 2""x2"" pressure treated board I had laying around and made two end pieces to finish the lip all the way around the feeder. Just that 1/2 lip on each end keep 80% off the feed in the feeder which is where I prefer to view my birds.Otherwise good product and great shipping."
39291,0,"Bought this litter box for my two cats. They love it. However I am not using the rolling/cleaning feature.

I would not buy this litter box again because I am not using the drawer, which means I am wasting one third of the space reserved for the cleaning function. A plus however is that my cats love to sleep on top of the box and the esthetics is OK. Be aware that the large box is really huge."

They do the job to protect our boys' paws from salt, but the nylon shell wore through inside of a week so they are definitely not weather proof... Their little paws wind up wet anyway so we no longer bother to put these on them if it is just raining. If it is muddy, it would offer some protection from dirt-but I would not recommend these (or call them all weather) except for the fact that they seem to be the best available...

197198,0,"Let's start with what might be the most important information to many, but not all, cat owners. My cat seems to love this water dish. Occasionally I will still find him in the bathroom navigating toilet water, but more often than not, he is enjoying this fountain. In that, Catit serves it's purpose. The problem is this thing seems to be really finicky to me. I had it in my bedroom but had to move it. If you don't have the bowl just right, the water doesn't dispense properly and it starts getting air into the pump. It appeared right to be until I woke up to loud gurgling and churning in the middle of the night. If that isn't a problem, sometimes I can't get this thing to run the water evenly over the bowl so there are patches of dry areas. It says to run your hand over it to fix that, that's not always the case, and the plastic top has never fit just perfectly for mine. I assume that's by design but maybe it's defective.I really did love this machine when I first got it, put it down, and it did it's thing. Since the first refill... been annoying, and I even cleaned it up too incase something was getting stuck in it... not a problem.My cat likes, so I will put up with it, but I am spending a lot more time tinkering around with this fountain every time i fill it than i ever did with my fresh flow. That's my only complaint though, everything is great when it works properly well that and the blue mat show on this product is not included... it's an add on."

One of my cats went nuts over this sparkler. I really did not expect this. Is it the noise? Is it that cats (like me) also like SHINY things? The sparkler refill had him spinning in circles and making impressive leaps in fast repetition until he was panting, and he still did not want to stop! I think I found part of the cure to kitty obesity here!Yes, the sparkler things start to fall off. Do not allow the cat to play with this thing without supervision. You do not want kitty to eat this plastic. And some cats will like it better than others."
43165,2,"After reading the other reviews I was excited to try this. I have a 60lb lab mix who loves to run in the snow. Extreme cold temps and road salt made it painful. I've tried this product a couple times and it did not work for my dog. First the product says it dries in a few minutes after applied. This did not dry and left greasy paw prints on my rug. Also, once out in the snow, it appeared the snow stuck to my dogs feet and he painfully picked up his feet more frequently. My latest attempt was a disaster. After walking on the street, the slushy grime, typical once snow starts to melt, mixed with the Musher's Secret and formed a tar-like consistency stuck between my dogs toes. Wiping his feet did not remove it and only after several washings with Dawn dishwashing liquid did the grime come out. Unfortunately I now have black, greasy paw prints on my good rugs.Am I doing something wrong? Any advice?"

Works great for my very large angelfish, however, as they have pretty small mouths. This one floats, though I know other NLS foods sink pretty quickly, depending on the size of the pellet, I am assuming. Worth the money, and I won't likely buy my fish anything else. My two angels also grew drastically after I began using it, even though they had been crawling along in development prior. Could be coincidence, but who knows! Also, ordering it from Amazon saved me a bit, because only one local store carries this brand and they charge more than what I paid for the food and the shipping combined."

140432,0,"If you are looking for a bird feeder that squirrels can not steal from, look elsewhere. Squirrels are smart, and I have one that figured out how to climb down the hanger and cling to the feeder upside down, helping himself to the bird seed. I guess I'll have to try using a dome-shaped shield on the hanger and see if that helps. For now, I will try to keep the squirrels distracted by keeping an adequate supply of cheaper food on the ground where it is easier to access. Also, if you are shopping for your first bird feeder, I recommend getting a smaller one to start out. This one has a much larger capacity than my birds consume in a reasonable time, so I end up dumping most of the food when it's time to clean it and refill it with fresh food. Birds don't like moldy food. They also don't seem to like the cheaper seed blends that have a lot of milo and other cheap fillers, at least not here in upstate NY. It's probably better to have a number of smaller feeders instead of one large feeder, anyway. Just hope you're feeding the birds instead of the squirrels, or it can get expensive! Oh, I also read that squirrels don't like thistle, so maybe I'll get a thistle feeder as well. Not all birds like thistle, so a variety of feeders is a good idea. I would also like to get a suet feeder for a larger variety of backyard visitors, but squirrels like suet too."

39263,1,"I have 3 cats and a busy life, so scooping a litter box daily was a fair amount of work. I spent several months researching the LitterRobot as well as the Cat Genie because I did really want my cats to have a clean litter box as much as possible. I decided that the Litter Robot was the way to go, despite the fairly high price. I then remembered seeing this product a few times but had dismissed it on grounds that it must be cheap, inferior and more of a hassle than it was worth.I was so very wrong.I read the reviews and after seeing the large number of positive reviews, I decided to try it. Every single one of them had it right, this box rocks! You still have to tend to the litter box at least once every 36-48 hours, but you really should do it daily. (With 3 cats at least, with one cat you could easily slide by with every other day.) It's very easy to roll it over and dump the cup into a grocery bag and toss the waste away. I haven't had a problem with the clips breaking but then I'm grabbing the bottom lip and rolling it over that way to avoid stressing the clips. Yes, they are kinda flimsy plastic. Sucks, they should work on that. The whole box honestly feels kinda flimsy compared to a traditional litter box, but it works well and if it was any thicker plastic it'd be a challenge to roll. I can see how the elderly would struggle to roll this thing, it can get heavy with a proper amount of litter. I do recommend keeping the litter level fairly high, as it helps get the waste into clumps and into the cup. I've had this for over a month now and have actually enjoyed taking care of the litter box. That's so weird! Definitely worth a shot and I'm thrilled I took the chance."

I never did get to unpack the rest of the crate, but it's labeled in Chinese and packaged with Chinese assembly instructions - um, that could be a problem for at least some non-Chinese consumers. Overall, an inferior product. Don't waste your time."

74257,2,"I did a fair amount of research about these style of gate before buying one. The majority are designed and on the market for new parents of human babies. Traditional dog gates can be limited in the features they offer. So believe me when I say I was super excited about getting this gate for my home, my dog's safety and implied ease of use for me. I had to purchase an extension for the Carlson Extra Wide to fit in my front hallway preventing the puppy from running to the door every time someone knocked or walked by. I was hopeful when I took it out of the box. The construction and welding seems sturdy and this is true, but unfortunately there has to more to recommend a gate then its construction. I also found out the ideally it is a two person job, because you want each of the 4 tightening screws to be equally extended for maximum stability of this gate. The bottom bar that runs across the the length of the opening can be tripped on, pushed etc.. slightly moving the entire placement of the gate or slanting it inward or outward.But here is my major disappointment and complaint about the design of the gate. The Extra Wide has a red slide lock that sits behind the locking mechanism on the gate. Meaning that a person must know to slide the red square back and up BEFORE even trying to lift the lock latch up and at a 90 degree angel before opening the gate. The two step process of releasing and engaging the lock is not made clear by any markings on the gate- like ""step 1"" or ""push back"" ""Step two"" or ""lift to 90 degrees"" I can't tell you how many times full grown adults who have Master's to your average joe like me looked at this gate and I had to explain how to open and then close it. I had to say "" you have to pull back on the red thing and then lift up on the latch until it is at a 90 degree angel for the gate to work. So, the day came , a guest was leaving and they simply pulled up on the latch without pulling back on the child safety lock, red thing and two small pieces of plastic gate fell to the ground and it was broken - done. This gate was not inexpensive. I was hoping it would last a bit longer then about 5 months or less before a simple mistake, not any kind of misuse could break it so easily and completely. The lock, with the child safety (red thing) is totally unneeded or at the least poorly designed and is far too hard to operate with ease or without risk of breaking it. If all that is standing between me and a total waste of money is two little plastic knobs I wish I had know , so I could have spent my money somewhere else. So I would not be where I am now - with a lot of plastic & metal gate that I will have to pay to throw away at the dump. Plus the need to buy a whole new gate at yet another not minor expense - nearly $100 dollars when it is all said and done and at your door. expense. Why is everything made so darn cheaply? Is it really that hard to get it right? I guess the fact that there are countless child and pet gates out there answers my question. Yes, it is so hard to do it right the first time around. Was hoping for a better made product that was designed knowing it would be opened and closed several times a day for years. not 5 months or less."
145250,1,"Buy it. I used a clicker to get our litter-mate shelie puppies (2x8 months) to fetch. They picked it up at about 4 months. This toy is perfect. I bought it at 7 months once they had fetch with balls. Simply perfect. I alternate between this toy and ""Chuck-it"" hard rubber balls to play with them. Let me put it this way. Before I bought this and the Chuck It ball, they would great me at the door with tail wags and dances after work. Now, when I come home after work, they bark once or twice and do not come to me, but instead go to the back door to go outside and play fetch.

147386,2,I purchase this collar for my noisy weim. I have used bark collars in the past (have no idea of the brand) with much success. This one is a piece of junk.

These collars are way over priced for the job they DO NOT do!
183665,0,"A little larger than I expected. It holds three cups if you fill it all the way to the brim, but effectively holds only 1.5 cups as I will explain:The clips that attach the cup to the cage are very close to the top edge, with no way to attach the bottom. The clips are horizontal, so they act as a pivot. This means it can be flipped upward a couple of inches (by a bunny-rabbit's nose for example) and a significant portion of whatever is in it will be catapulted out of the cup, through the bars, and all over about six feet of floor. The amount of food launched depends on the strength of the flip.My rabbit loved this game when he discovered it. He was apparently going for distance, trying to beat his personal best. Which is laudable. Self-improvement is so important. I, however, did not love cleaning up the mess. So, I figured out to minimize the spills (or launches) I can only fill the cup half way.The cup does have a lip around the top, to keep food or liquids from slopping over the edge while your animal is eating or drinking. If you have a polite animal, it might work better for you.Note to manufacturers: I will purchase another one of these, only if you eliminate the pivoting action. The no-spill lip is a good idea but the implementation is lacking. Also, stainless steel is much nicer than plastic, especially for rabbits."
39052,0,"I bought this on Amazon and have been using it for 2 years with 2 cats. My initial enthusiasm has slacked off a bit. It is a good product but has a few issues.First, the top and bottom do NOT latch together tightly enough. I solved this by applying duct tape all around the seam. If it is not taped then litter leaks at the seams every time it is rolled. The tape method works but makes it a bigger pain to clean.Second, the grate slats seem too big. Over time quite a bit of litter, poop and small litter clumps get through the grate and accumulate on the far side of the grate. This creates less space for the clean litter to go into, and eventually means I have to take the whole thing apart (including untaping it) to hose it down. I think the grate slats should be narrower/smaller.Third, the grate can come detached from the little slots it fits into in the bottom of the box. The grate simply rests into 2 small grooves. A few times it has come up and out of the grooves which allows LOTS of clean litter to be wasted with each roll. The grate needs to have a better method to keep it firmly seated in the base.Fourth, there is a ""sweet spot"" for the amount of litter needed to be kept in the box. Too much litter and it doesn't all fit in the grate-bin on rolling and clean litter gets wasted. But too little litter causes urine clumps to stick to the bottom. When rolled I have to give the base of the box (now on top after rolling) a couple sharp whacks to dislodge the clumps. This works, but probably contributes to my complaint #3 above of the grate coming loose. This also sometimes produces litter smears on the top (ie- the top when is normal position) which I have to wipe out or it gets on the cat's head.Overall, I like the product but I feel it could benefit from 2 design modifications. One is to improve the seal between top and bottom so taping isn't needed. The second is to modify the grate so the slats are smaller and it stays firmly attached to the bottom . I'm sure this would raise the price. To me it would probably be worth it because having to take the whole thing apart to clean it is such a mess. Right now I'm thinking of going back to a regular litter box with sifting liners.PETCO Jumbo Sifting Cat Litter Box LinersI have used those in the past and find them very easy to use and overall less messy. Still, for 35 bucks its a pretty good product. Just needs some tweaking."
103163,0,"I bought this because my cat kept knocking over his food bowl and I needed something that would keep the bowl in place. I originally bought a combination food and water bowl that did not detach, but when I needed to refill the water, too ofter water would spill into the food bowl making it soggy. This lets me fill the food and water separately to avoid that mess. While it works - and works well - the plastic is quite cheap. The water bowl sags under the weight of the water when I carry it by the handle, and the bowl does not seem to be dish washer safe. Also, the sticker label that came with the bowl could not be fully peeled off. Large remnants remain."

80110,1,"About two months ago I suddenly realized my three dogs were infested with ticks. I had never found more than one tick on any pet, so I was overwhelmed with the literally hundreds of ticks of all sizes I was picking off my dogs. They had also infested my house. I bought these collars and put them on my dogs while they still had some ticks on them. Within a few days, I could find no more ticks on the dogs or the house. I just wish these were sold in stores. I will be buying these regularly from now on!"
80413,2,"My nextdoor neighbors have a young, large German shepard that they leave out all day and night. It barks all day long...but the police won't do anything about it because its not a ""sustained"" bark over a certain amount of time. The neighbors are elderly acloholics and will bring the dog in when i complain, but the next day its business as usual. Telling the dog to lie down and go to sleep didnt work...reporting the dog to the city police officers didnt work...talking nicely to the neighbors didnt work...so i tried out the Pet-Agree. Guess what? Nothing. The dog is 30 feet away and it had no affect. So, i went with Plan B. I pulled out an old wrist-rocket i have and plunked the dog on the rear end. He ran under the deck and didnt come out for the rest of the day. Works every time. Thanks Pavlov for the conditioned-response research. Problem solved."
55326,0,"I love the idea of this cat toy/feeder....especially since I have a fat cat. Unfortunately, my cats just aren't interested in it. When I put cat food in it, the only time they touch it is if they accidentally brush up against it. I also tried putting cat treats in it (just to spur interest). One cat just pushes it around with her nose until she gets something out of it (there's no ""play"" involved), and one cat just looks at it until she gets distracted by something shiny in the next room. I finally got sick of it and put it away...I kept accidentally kicking it. The ball would go flying, and food would fall everywhere. I will continue to try to get them to use it, but it's not looking good."

191352,0,"I purchased this item because I wanted fresh water for my dogs. I have 5 dogs and during the day they stay outside in the patio. That's where I placed the water fountain. Thank God I have an electracal outlet outside and was able to connect it. Overall, it's a good little fountain if you only have one dog. In my case, only one one of my 5 dogs dared drink from it and the rest refused. I figured it's due to the noice it makes and because they are used to their old water container.I would recommend it if you have a new pup that will get used to drinking water from it, or if you only have one dog."
142023,1,"I have an 11 year old jack russell who has tartar buildup on the way back molars so you can only see part of the teeth. He had only minimal placque on the canines. I have been using the gel at night and the spray in the morning since November, 2010. The placque on the canines is gone but I don't see a lot ofimprovement in the molars. Slight improvement in his breath. He is on the weight border line so I am going to up to the 1/3t gel at night and see if thathelps. I also have a soon to be 5 year old Aussie/heeler. Her teeth look brand new. I use the gel 3x a week on her and brush in the evening. I wish I wouldhave done this 11 years ago on my jr but was busy dealing with his urate stone forming problem! Anyway, works great on the aussie, her breath smells like clean air and the vet says her teeth look beautiful. I will report back after increasing the dose for my jack russell.Update on Oct. 25, 2011After a trip to the vet for yearly exam in June, the vet said I should really have a dental done on my jr. So I did. Since then I have been using the Oravet sealer once a week and the Petzlife gel on a tooth brush every night and so far, after 4 months, his teeth look good. His breath still smells bad and even after his dental it wasn't fresh smelling. Might have something to do with his food for urate stones. Anyway, I am happy with the protocol I am using and will continue. Would recommend the Petzlife oral gel, it is still working great on my Aussies teeth too.ps: forgot to add that after my dogs dental cleaning, it turned out he had no gingivitis nor gum inflammation, so even though the Petzlife didn't clean all the tartar and plaque off the molars, it was keeping the inflammation down on his gumline."
66316,1,"The pet pen was a welcome surprise prior to Christmas because I was expecting it after Christmas. I use it for my Pom who has only three paws and had to have a pin put in her left knee area. With the removable top, made picking her up and attending to her very easy.My Pom thoroughly loves her new home and so does her toy Pom sister. I am also thoroughly satisfied with the Ricell Pet Pen.I would recommend the Richell Pet Pen to anyone."
51136,1,This is a great product. I love it. The following are the reasons why I love it:1. Retail price at Petco is $59.99. I paid about %40 less.2. It is made in the U.S.A.3. Its quality.4. Easy to use.5. I could store it anywhere.6. I used it twice and had no problems so far.7. It would take as twice as amount of time for getting the same job done if I were still using the pail.
158457,1,Great product. I had to return this particular crate only because it was too small for my Doberman but overAll loved the quality and the size of the crate.
169334,0,"I kind of bought this out of curiosity because I don't have a naturalistic terrarium, I have a reptibreeze, but since it is the same company I thought I could make it work. NO! I have to send it back. Also, I have a water dragon and it says on the packaging that you don't want to use this with any climbers. Pretending it did fit for my enclosure, I would return it anyways. The bar is plastic and not very durable. It only comes with one fixture, You have to buy the other two separate. In hindsight, I love the look of it, but it seems kind of dangerous afterall.If you have a naturalistic enclosure and a non climing reptile, make sure you get the extra fixtures so you can mount your three bulbs instead of just one. Also, you will have to dissasemble the top if your terrarium to affix this light bar."
56363,0,"Linatone plus works awesomely with my GSD... he sheds when he actually has to, not just whenever, which is great.EntirelyPets was a WHOLE other story. Talking to them is like talking to a wall. I had issues with my order, and really only got $5 back from all the problems. Don't bother ever trying to email them or call them - calling will lead you to being on hold for 20-30 minutes (no joke, I timed it!), and emailing will lead to responses that have nothing to do with the severity of the issue you're emailing about to begin with. Unfortunately due to this experience, I'm going to have to look elsewhere for Linatone Plus, even if I pay extra."
109024,0,"It works well enough, although it seems a bit finicky about whether it will respond to the command module or not.The shock seems pretty weak, and of the three small dogs (10-20 lbs) that we have had it on, only one noticed the shock at all, even on the highest setting.They all respond quite well to the tone however (when it decides to respond to the control button.)The collar goes through batteries pretty quickly, just from being powered on. So remember to power if off when ever it is not in use.For the price, it's a decent trainer."
201853,0,Not bad. Probably for dogs with longer hair like retrievers. I have 2 beagles that shed a lot and this product really didn't make a difference.

116765,1,I have three big dogs and this is a replacement set after having the others for over 5 years. So much better than a buckle or clip collar - have never had a problem with them breaking or the girls slipping out of it.
125544,1,"This crate is exactly as described. It's well-made and very sturdy, enough so as to withstand the shenanigans of one of my dogs who is creative when bored. The latches to the door line up exactly and are smooth and easy to slide but, again, are dog-proof. Plus, the handles are rubberized making them that much easier to use. Assembly was simple inasmuch as there isn't any assembly - just unfolding. I got what I wanted and what I paid for."
143571,0,"I've installed the HOT Magnum with the BioWheel attachment (HOT Magnum Pro) on my 55 gallon tank for about 6 months now, and I'm very impressed with the performance of this filter system. This canister filter is powerful and power thrifty at 250gph while using only 18 watts. I especially like having the filter out of sight hanging behind the tank.This combination of canister filter and biowheel is pretty amazing. The water is very clear thanks to the no by pass design of the canister and the tank is well oxygenated due to the spray bar/biowheel component. The biowheel is also great at removing amonia and nitrite which becomes undetectable (amonia less than 0.25mg/liter and nitrite less than 0.1mg/liter) after a few days of running this filter. That's with a bio load of 12 adult Angelfish, 10 large swordtails, and 5 bushynose plecos! If you don't understand what all this mean, then trust me when I tell you the performance of this system is hard to beat.Now for the down side: This filter is a pain to clean.First of all, don't bother using the fine carbon that comes with the filter. This will cause your filter to clog up in no time if you have a heavily stocked tank like me. I threw out the carbon after the first week and replaced it with ceramic noodles, which does not clog at all. The nylon mesh sleeve works well to trap fish waste, but is messy to clean or replace, and you have to take the whole filter apart to do it. After I spent a few minutes taking this apart, clean it, reassemble it, and fill it with water, mine filter sometimes lose syphon and I have to take it apart and assemble it again. I have to pay special attention to the stupid red gasket that likes to fall out when I not careful. This is why I gave this filter 3 stars.The power switch is located near the bottom of the backside of the filter. While it's nice to have a power switch, the placement is bad because it's right up against the wall and you have to reach all the way down the back of your tank to reach it.So, to sum up. If you want one of the best performing and efficient filter and don't mind having to take a filter apart and get messy once awhile (for me that's about every 2 weeks), then this is the filter for you.Additional note: The BioWheel Pro30 (the one with spray bar) is really fantastic in it's performance, and is key to the awesome performance of this system. This component can be used with other easier to clean internal canister or powerheads, so don't ever discard this attachment.Update Oct 13, 2011I got tired of cleaning canister filters. Got sick of taking the canisters apart, cleaning all the pieces, putting it back together, and then reinstalling the filter to the tank.I've installed the Emperor 400 on 4 of my larger tanks. This outside hang-on-the-back power filter has the bio-wheels with spray bar and cartridges that are disposable. No more cleaning dirty sponges and taking apart canisters!!!"
30568,2,"I hoped it would work in my small aquariums, but it did not. I guess the water levels weren't high enough? I have no idea why it was not able to vacuum anything out, but it would've really been useful and a convenient tool had it worked since I got it so that I wouldn't have to do a full water change so often or use a siphon on such small tanks. It did work okay in my full size tanks."
62976,1,"I purchased this filter to replace the cheap starter filter that came with my aquarium. The problem with my original filter was the lack of a bio sponge, so that every time I replaced the filter medium, ammonia levels would rise while the new filter grew bacteria, resulting in the nitrite spike when the bacteria finally caught up. I don't know whether this filter would actually handle a 50 gallon aquarium, but on a 20 gallon aquarium, cloudy water and detectable levels of ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite have become a thing of the past.When I initially set up the filter it was a bit noisy, but after removing and reinstalling the impeller it ran with an almost indiscernible hum. The bio falls booster has the additional side effect of slowing the water on the way out of filter so that it reenters the aquarium less violently than my previous filter despite pumping twice as much water. This helps the filter run quietly with no splashing if your water level is adjusted properly.The activated carbon filter is unique in that it is broken into a number of cells that each contain activated carbon. As a result, more of water flowing through the filter is exposed to the carbon without sacrificing ease of a slide-in cartridge.I have only two criticisms of this filter. First, the flow of the carbon cartridge should have been made higher, as there is a small amount of overflow even when this cartridge is new if the filter flow is adjusted to the maximum setting. Second, most of the noticeable noise from the filter comes from the vibration of the lid. This can be overcome by running without the lid, or by using a small piece of tape. This vibration made me question the build quality of an otherwise excellent filter."

8303,0,"The oil itself works great on any hair clippers (not just Wahl brand, I use it on myAndis 29775 Headliner Trimmer), but the stupid dispenser nozzle dumps out a ton of oil when you squeeze the bottle even gently. This is unacceptable and the dispenser's obvious design flaw is suspicious. Is it possibly the intent of Wahl in making such a crappy dispenser is to get you waste oil so you have to buy more way sooner than you should have to? After having been totally underwhelmed by their ridiculously heavy, epic failWahl Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper 8470, I wouldn't be surprised. They probably also save a few pennies going with the awful nozzle instead of paying for one that works properly. One solution is to use an eyedropper to remove and apply the oil to your clippers, but you wouldn't have to do that if Wahl was actually producing a proper dispenser.The oil is five stars, the dispenser head is a one, which averages my rating out to three stars. I'll probably be switching toAndis Clipper Oil 4ozor another brand in the future. That's how much I hate the dispenser head on this bottle!"

This was in Florida and even the HOT summer did not smell. I recently moved and decided to get another unit. This one has not worked at all and I would say it has to do with the soil. I now live in an area where the soil is very sandy and fine. I will fill up the water level and it is gone in less then an hour. Even the rainy season didn't help. The Doggie Dooley is now totally full of dog droppings and I can no longer use it. Also the ""step-on"" lid broke (a rivet popped) before I even finished the install.

He would cry and keep going and keep getting shocked and I would beg and plead for him to come back closer to me so the shocks would stop. After a few days of training with the flags and beeps, he finally got it. I do have to add that he hates the collar and when we get ready to go outside he gets really irritated when I get it out. Once we get outside however, he forgets about it. I guess each dog is different."

Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon.

Unfortunately, these products are not identical or interchangeable. The Halti size 3 is MUCH larger than the Holt collar so the collar sent to me (twice) was too large for my dog. Also, the holt collar has a camlock on the chinstrap. This camlock seems to keep the chinstrap snuggly on the dog. My dog is a bit of a monster-puppy so we need all the reinforcing details we can get -- without the camlock, she can get a loose bit of the chinstrap into her mouth and can bite the harness in half in the blink of an eye. I know this because she has bitten through 4 Size 2 Haltis. I called Amazon customer service to see what I could do to make sure I got the Coastal Holt halter and the representative said I'd probaby just continue to be sent Haltis.

123086,1,"I was house sitting for a friend and watching the dog and I used the Sweepa there first. I noticed how easily it collected the dog hair and every bit of dust in the area. So I bought one for myself and am just as pleased. My dog is short haired, but he still leaves his locks all about the house and they are barely visible but I know they are there. With the Sweepa I can get all of his hair and all of the micro dust particles that make their way into the apartment. I haven't used it wet, but I love what the Sweepa does in the usual dry condition. If you have a pet you will really appreciate it."
210668,0,"I got my unit fast, looks exactly like the picture, easy to install, and is pretty solid.But I failed to ""read between the lines"", so this is not going to work for my configuration.My cats are indoor cats - but I needed this because one cat (RJ) is on a prescription diet (he HATES it), and I need to feed my other cat separately. So this door was intended to allow his brother (Archimedes) into the study, where he could have free access to his non-prescription food.Here are the problems I encountered with my configuration:(1) The locking mechanism is a plastic tab, held in place by a magnet. RJ is big enough/strong enough to break through the lock. He's about 12 pounds. Granted, he's slightly OCD, and more persistent than the normal kitty, especially when it comes to food! However, I can imagine a persistent Raccoon or Possum (anything over 20 pounds) could also break through the lock if using on an exterior door. Just to be clear - the door is not ""broken"" - it still functions, but it can pop open with about 20 pounds of pressure.(2) The lock is only one direction, designed to keep other animals OUT. So in my case, I had to install the door backwards (i.e., any cat can go OUT, but only the cat with the collar can come back in).(3) The opening is pretty small. Works fine for my cats (9 and 12 pounds), but might be a tight fit for a small dog or a larger cat.(4) The door will only latch shut if it swings shut. If your cat proceeds through the door slowly, or if your cat has a long tail, the door will NOT always latch shut.* FIX: Install the door at a tilted angle, with the top of the door leaning about 10 degrees, so that it always swings shut. This is trickier than it sounds, but I GUARANTEE it works, if that's your only issue.If anyone finds a better option, please comment - I'm still looking for a solution.

216815,0,"I have tried for years to find a good bulb for lighting (both in the house and the aquarium) that renders colors as well as incandescent or halogen, but without a yellow tinge. I think that by now we should be able to reproduce the full spectrum of sunlight artificially without making it feel harsh, cold, or unnatural. Apparently technology hasn't caught up to my expectations. No fluorescent bulb looks like pure white sunlight.I originally rated this bulb a two, because I wanted a pure white light that made the tank look the same as it does in sunlight. If that's what you're looking for, don't buy this bulb. Unfortunately, don't buy any fluorescent bulb. I tried about four different bulbs by different makers of high quality fluorescent bulbs before I tried colormax. Since it wasn't the natural look I wanted, I tried six more bulbs, again by different manufacturers at different color temperatures. I've spent over two hundred dollars and still haven't found a bulb that doesn't have a yellow, blue, red, or purple tinge. This bulb has a purple tinge, by the way. However, after a couple months of searching and trying bulbs of all kinds, I keep putting this one back in as my default bulb. It's not exactly what I was looking for, but it does make my blue dwarf gourami, yellow molly, and red guppy stand out nicely, just not the same color they have under sunlight.If you want a bulb that looks as close to white sunlight, this is at best a 2/5. But, if you want a bulb that makes the colors of your fish look brighter, deeper, and more vibrant (and you don't care if the colors of your fish look like the would in sunlight), then this bulb gets a 4/5.The average is 3/5. So, depending on what you want, take the rating with a grain of salt. Unless I can find something I like more, I'll keep using this."

112790,0,"I have two cats. The teddy bear style cat (male) has no problem having these put on, and they stay put for a while. The high-strung hysterical one (female) struggles from the moment she is held till the end of the exercise of applying these. Then she bites them off -- she has gotten better at this. They are pretty much all gone after about a week. In terms of protecting furniture, they work fine if they stay on the cat, but if the cat is determined to get them off, then it will probably be able to do so. I've been trying to do this (b/c I can't think of anything else) for nearly a year, so I don't think the female is going to get used to it after a while."
88654,0,"One cat drinks from it no problem. The other cat however will only drink from it the same day the water is changed. We keep changing the flow regulator (thinking this might help prohibit any algae growth), we have changed water more frequently (up to almost every other day now, which stinks as it is not very convenient- including scrubbing all the difficult to reach crevices and such) but it doesn't matter, she prefers to drink fresh water from any stupid bowl in the house than day old water from this thing. Go figure. So, although this is a great concept, for us it was a complete waste of $50.00 as it hasn't solved our problem, as it seems the water still must taste stale somehow from this.Cleaning is also a pain, as there are a few small crevices. I have read other reviews about the noise, but ours has been virtually silent, so that isn't an issue at all. The small water sound it makes is nice. I split the review down the middle because our other cat seems to like it just fine."
79228,0,"My first experience with this harness was great. My golden retriever had neck surgery and I didn't want to use a regular collar anymore. This harness was great for her; and she was very easy to walk. Whenever she rolled around on her back in the grass the harness would come off because she would pull her front legs out, but it wasn't a big deal with her.My second experience with this harness was okay. I was fostering another golden retriever and he was very strong. The harness helped but walking him was still difficult, and my arm and back still hurt.When I adopted a corgie/sheltie mix, I felt confident in buying the same harness for her. Unfortunately it was a mistake. There were several problems. It fit her properly, but she would just stop walking. I wasn't sure if she was uncomfortable or not. The loop and ring on the chest area coupled with the clasp on the leash would bounce around too much and hit her chest as she walked. Really annoying, because it was too close to her face (being a short dog). The main problem and why I stopped using it was because she is a jumper/lunger when she sees a cat or another dog. Several times her short little legs were able to jump out of the harness. And that was with it tightened properly! I also had a problem with the leash being too close to her feet and having to hold it up so she wouldn't get tangled up in it.So, now I've just turned it around so that the clasp is on her back and I only use it as a car harness with a seatbelt attachment.One solution to the jumping out problem is to get a double clasp attachment that you could attach to the front chest ring and to the dog's collar so that the front part stays up when a dog flips out. I would have done this except the bouncing metal really annoyed her."

214193,0,"EDIT: 1/24/2012Unfortunately I've had to revise my review of this carrier. After a few months of use I posted that this carrier was 'perfect,' but I'm afraid I spoke too soon. After less than a year of use, the zippers on both of my pet taxis failed. The stitching didn't rip but the zippers themselves no longer seal allowing my cats to just push their way out of the carriers. Very disappointing after I was so impressed with this product.Further inspection shows me that the zippers are made of a rather flimsy plastic, not metal. One of my cats managed to push hard enough at the top of the carrier to 'burst' the zipper apart. My second cat figured it out after seeing the first escape. Now that they've learned they can do that, they continue to do so every time they're placed in their carriers. In light of this I've dropped my review from 5 to 3 stars. I enjoyed the perks of this product, but I'm not willing to repurchase since the lifetime of the pet taxi appears to be less than a year.Original review is below:-------------------------I've been using the same hard-sided plastic pet carrier since I had my first cat as a child. The thing was excellent, but everything has to go eventually, and I wanted to try something that would fold up nicely when not in use. I also wanted something that was easy to clean since not all of my cats have been good travelers. I was very wary of a soft-sided carrier, though, because I didn't want the animals to claw right through the mesh and escape. I was also worried about size, since the old carrier was big enough for 2 cats easily.I can't say enough about the petmate taxi. It looks great, works well, and the cats actually like it. I leave one out now because my cats like to sleep inside of it. I have two 14 lbs mainecoons and each one easily fits into this carrier with enough room to turn around. The top zipper is perfect for going to the vet or anywhere else stressful because I can stick my hand right in and comfort the cat. The case is very well ventilated and lets them see out and get plenty of air. The semirigid bottom is removable in case there is an accident, and is very comfortable for them. The should strap is a godsend, especially when both cats need to go somewhere.The case is lightweight and folds up to easy closet storage. No more shelf dedicated to holding the plastic carrier. The material is also pretty durable and we've had no rips or escapes yet, despite several uses. I can't promise that a determined cat won't get through, so don't use this as a 'crate' or anything like that, but for a carrier it's more than strong enough. All-in-all, 5 stars!"

173561,0,"I have purchased two large orange Aqua Kong on a rope for use in the pool and, as much as I wanted to love the toy, it just did not stand up to my 95-pound (muscle, not fat) male German Shepherd. I raise and train German Shepherds in obedience and Schutzhund sport, so I see a lot of big dogs and talk frequently with their owners/trainers. There is another male Shepherd in our club who has played retrieve games with his Aqua Kong for a year, and that toy is still in great condition.My dog, on the other hand bites through the plastic ""rope"" in minutes. The rest of the toy lasted a month or so (with supervised play,) but the ""float"" inside the toy did not work well at all. I finally replaced it with a piece of foam cut from a pool ""noodle."" The next pool season, I bought a new Aqua Kong (I really wanted to love this toy!) -- this one didn't last even one day. I was taking photos of my dog running around the pool with the brand new toy, and he just bit off the top section -- no chewing or tugging, just the pressure of his bite.While I continue to think that Kong toys are, in general, among the very best on the market, I would not recommend this particular toy if you have a big dog with a strong, powerful bite. Buy the black Extreme Kong instead and hope that Kong will add an ""extreme"" water Kong to the line!"

I googled the product and found HUNDREDS of reports of Hartz products killing and injuring dogs. They have been reprimanded by the EPA and contain harmful poisons. Yes, most flea and tick meds are literally pesticides, but other brands are much, much safer for your pet. I am outraged Hartz products are sold anywhere! For the safety of your beloved pet, google this before you purchase and apply this to any living creature. If you have applied it already, bathe the dog immediately with a powerful dish soap and contact your vet if it exhibits alarming symptoms."

174616,1,"The innotek sd2100 does the trick on my two beagles. The collars have been going now for 3 months or more and holding a green flashing light. Great to not have to worry about batteries. It does what it is supposed to, when at the boundary it gives a beeping noise for two seconds and then commences to giving a progressive stimulation. The collars are easy to take on and off and since they are beagles with short hair I do not have the collar tight but loose and it seems to do ok. My dogs have not attempted to chew on them either. The hardest part for me was running the wire, since the ground around my house is pretty solid. I used a gas powered edger and it helped to water the ground before or during edging to keep down the dust and make a cleaner slice in the ground. I used the double loop method since I didn't want to boundary of the back of the house where the dogs will be coming out from. It took about one and a half 500 ft rolls.My two beagles got shocked 4 or 5 times each and then they got the idea to stay back from the flags. I have put them out without the collar on and they still stay away from the flags. I haven't gotten around to taking up all the flags yet, I'm wondering if there will be a problem when I do eventually. I spent about twice the prescribed time training them to stay back from the flags, just to give them a fair shot but it took a few stimulations to teach them that this is not a game we are playing. They got over the stimulations easily after a couple of minutes of being held. I took them to the center of the yard and comforted them, then I walked them around the perimeter to show them their was nothing to fear if they stayed inside the flags. It's working great and they are enjoying running all over the back yard chasing each other. I wished I could have avoided running the double loop because you have to keep the wires at least 6 feet apart from each other and it takes away from their play area, I thought about running the wire along the gutter line across the back of the house but was unsure how that would work and didn't much want to put the wire on the house in case of lightning. I got the lightning protector and it is working fine also, at least I guess it is. My dogs are 15 and 20 pounds and a year old, they were ready for the fence.I would not use it on a puppy younger than 6 mos.unless he is a big dog."

When I use Gentle Leader, it helped but she really doesn't like the Gentle Leader where it goes around her mouth-muzzle area. She always try to roll around on the grass area and try to paw her way out of it. When I put this Easy Walk Harness on her, it takes a while to really get the correct position as there are quite a number of adjustments to do. Amazingly, she doesn't even try to walk in front of me when she's on the Easy Walk Harness. I do think that she feels more comfortable wearing the harness than the leader. Also, people have said that it's safer as it's not wrapped around just her neck and head. I very much prefer the harness and I would recommend it as long as you get the fitting correctly!"

This cot gets her off the cold damp deck and allows enough 'breeze' for her to still be cool. Now that we have a spaniel that sits with her, we find that tossing a blanket on one end is perfect. Our Berner lays on the cool part and the Spaniel snuggles on the blanket because it's warmer and softer than that ground.

148210,0,"These pads work well, and better than any other product I've tried. They're absorbent, they minimize the ordor, and the price is good...which is very important to me because we go through about a dozen a day. Service is also prompt."
20092,0,"Reading all the negative reviews I completely understand the issues they'd be talking about. Then again it should be common sense looking at these that obviously it wouldn't clump. These pellets are huge. They're probably 3/4 an inch long and 1/4 in diameter. Clay litter obviously is maybe 1/8 inch round, so it sticks to poop. These are kind of glossy.So bottom line is if you use this as a litter by itself, you're kind of dumb for even trying to do that with pellets like that.However, if you mix it in with clay litter and baking soda, it absorbs odor like you wouldn't believe. You can literally eat dinner right outside the litter box and won't smell a thing.Get the CLUMPING feline pine. That clumps and absorbs moisture perfectly. Also no odor. That's five stars, this is three just because it eliminates odors."
150532,1,The product is of quality. I did not like the container. It was difficult to open the container each time I wanted to use it. I therefore transferred it to a new container of my choice.
61289,2,"I bought this litterbox for $150 at the beginning of the year. Despite using premium cat litter AND FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS, THANK YOU, the rake would constantly get stuck. Also, my cats would sometimes pee on the cover where it would flow on to the floor. And, those disposable litter containers cost about a buck each. Today, the machine broke, and I am not going to bother calling the manufacturer because I don't want the darned thing repaired; it's going to the landfill.Two different friends of mine have a LitterMaid, and are quite pleased with the product -- I bought this one because of that. The difference is that I bought the ""Elite Mega,"" while they have earlier versions. The rake on the Elite Mega is exposed all the time, where theirs goes into a slot, and I think that the older ones are just better engineered and less cheaply made. So, if you want an automated litterbox, avoid this particular model. The others might be okay, and I just may try one of them (besides, I've got about $50 worth of disposable litter containers).I did call customer service once, and the woman on the other end was rude and useless, so no points there, either.Good Luck!Dorene"
54726,1,"I'm allergic to clay litter, and also allergic to pine, so finding a good litter has been a neverending battle. I'm sooooo happy with this one! You can't even tell there is a catbox in the room! absolutly the best at soaking up odors! The ONLY problem i've had get a new sifter scoop for between cleanings, since the one i had didn't have wide enough space between the teeth, and the litter is too large to go through the sifter. but well worth that small hassle!Some people might not like it because it's not a clumping litter, but you don't need it to be, it soaks up the smell that well!"
213027,2,This product does have a strong medicinal odor (think vets office)I am not sure as to whether it works to alleviate allergy symptoms as my meds were upped around the same time as we used the shampoo.
126721,1,I love seeing my little happy hummingbirds.Easy to assemble and use.I make my own sugar water and don't spend money on special food.EVERYDAY I see the birds at my home. LOVE THIS!
147369,1,"I bought this collar for my dog, she is a papillon, because she would go crazy around most other dogs, especially ones bigger than her. She was attacked by a big dog when she was a puppy and since then, she has been acting this way toward new big dogs that she meets.So, we got the collar and it works for the most part. She is no longer able to do this cute greeting-bark that she used to do when she was happy which makes us sad, but when she meets a new dog she will maybe try to bark but then yelp and only do a low bark or ""boof"" as we like to call it. The collar works for what we wanted it for. The sad thing is that is goes off sometimes when she shakes really hard, I don't know if it is because of the rattling of her dog tags or what. Also, it went off when she sneezed one time which made us feel bad! I still think it is worth it for her to stay safe by not going crazy on big dogs and not being uncontrollable.It seems a little bulky and heavy but our dog doesn't seem to be bothered by it. She is 9 pounds. Also, she is very furry but we didn't shave her neck or anything and it still works. When we first got the collar, we tested it on ourselves (you just put the battery in and everything, then run it along a flat, hard surface (like a table) and then touch it with your fingers. It hurts! but at least you know how it feels and can use it wisely)"
18605,0,First one out of the box the overflow box leaked. I called globalpets and told them about it.They responded quick and was able to ship me another over flow a week later.Everything worked as expected except the siphon from the tank back to the overflow wasn'tgoing very fast so the return pump didn't have enough water to pump back.
113030,1,"I think this product is great! I have always cut my cat's nails since she was a little kitten so she is used to me handling her paws. I cut her nails, put about 2 drips of the glue in each cap and stuck it on, they dried very quickly and she only messed with them for about 10 minutes before she was comfortable with them. They have been on for a few weeks now and not only does she look adorable but playing with her and not getting scratched is awesome, and the furniture is not getting damaged! :)"
99122,0,I purchased these diapers for my incontinent maltese. They are nice but I did notice sometimes they leak. They also tend to slip down her tail and come off. After she has urinated in them the weight of them pulls them off her back no matter how tightly I put them on. They are also expensive as my dog is on a diuretic and goes often. I would only use these in a pinch or if you are going out and need to use a disposable diaper but not for regular use. I would purchase the washable dog diapers instead.
206860,0,"I like the design of the crate, but quality is lacking. The crate has chips in the chrome in various places. Moreover, one of he ""hooks"" that secures the crate into its open position is incorrectly fabricated so the crate does not latch in the corner. It is basically bent too far in and, because of the strength of the steel (perhaps a good thing) will not bend to correct shape. It was enough for me to want to return it, except that the packaging it arrived in required a box-cutter to open.Also, I feel the med/large is too small for my 41 lb Brittany. He cannot stand up full in it; but that part I could have measured better, so not their fault. I bought it to provide a surgery recovery area for the dog, so I am stuck owning it. Because I own a 30"" soft crate, I thought this one would be visibly bigger; instead, it is the same height and just a tad longer. If I were to do it again, I think I would buy a crate in a brick-mortar pet store."
117407,1,"I inherited a really big and clumsy cat when I got married. Recently, he's fallen off stuff and hurt himself, my wife took him to the cat doctor and xrays showed lots of arthritis in his hips. I've been giving him this stuff for a few months, not even every day, and he's jumping and running like I would imagine that a new cat does. Funny thing is, the cat thinks its a treat and comes running whenever I shake the bottle. Great product."
97122,0,"I bought this toy to keep my heavy chewing german shepherd busy. It worked great until he spent some time on the rubber ""teeth"" in the middle. If you dog tries hard enough, he will be able to rip the rubber apart and leave it on your floor for you. I still use the toy, but only when I can monitor. Once he gets going on the rubber, I take it away."
97906,1,"Good product, my cat loves the food and he doesnt get overweight from eating too much of it, which i love."
185573,2,"I ordered it for my Mini Pin who is 6 pounds. The collar is too thick and hard, it does not bend easily and the plastic is hard. You use the metal plate where shows the logo (inside part) to write with a permanent marker the info about your dog, this metal part also pops out easily so the dog can loose it and I think the permanent marker can get faded with time. It might work for bigger dogs since the material is vey tought."
83453,0,"The size is great for the price, but my package arrived heavily dented. It was hard to set-up, and some of the sides don't seem to hinge together very well. So far, my dog hasn't tested the limits of the crate, but I fear one day I will have to add zip-ties to the corners to keep it from collapsing if he ever decides to try..."
173094,0,So far so good. I don't think it is quite as good as Proin but it is comparable & cheaper.
95333,2,"I love how slim these collars are, but I put the collar on my cat after the clasp on the one she was wearing broke. She was sleeping on my bed when I put it on her. 10 minutes later, I noticed that the collar had come off, and lo and behold - it was because the plastic had broken. She wasn't even doing any crazy cat acrobatics.I ordered the kind that has no plastic clasp directly from the manufacturer and would give that 5 stars."
68482,1,"I wasn't aware of the need to brush my dog's teeth until speaking with my friend, who is a vet. After an unsuccessful dental nylabone try, I bought this. My dog enjoyed the taste, and enjoyed having her gums brushed. I noticed a difference in her breath immediately. Great product."
98669,0,"Some background info about my pup: She tugs and pulls everywhere we go. It's like she doesn't even recognize me at the other end of the leash while at home she listens to everything I say. Sometimes she likes to make my life harder when she hops 4-5 ft instead of walking. She is a 45 lb labrador/hunting hound mix. When she sees squirrels, she gets into hunting position with her body low against the ground and walks like a lion about to catch its prey. She goes from an angle where the squirrel cannot see her. When she is 5 ft from the squirrel she will make such a prounce that it feels like my arm has been almost ripped out if I'm not careful. I still love her though.About the Product: This leash has done the job for casual walks. I will NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of retractable leash if I know we will be in an area where I want her to be close, controlled and safe next to me. I just don't trust my pup too far away on a thin leash like this (even if it is all belted) with her hyperactivity and strength. Any moving object will make her go crazy and she can EASILY snap a leash like this especially if she is 16 ft out since I have less control the farther she is. I use it only on night walks when I know there are not many squirrels or distracting things outside. She has her freedom to walk a little bit more on the grass and go to the bathroom. Other than that, for her exercise I will take her to a dog park, baseball field or by the waterfront near me on a sturdy 6 ft leash where I run along with her.I would recommend retractable leashes for small dogs (yorkies, chihuahuas, malteses, etc.) I would not recommend retractable leashes for hyper dogs (of any size really other than toy size) or large dogs especially if it's somewhere risky or not safe. This leash is great for casual walks where you want your dog to have some bit of freedom."
7412,0,"You can buy a plastic box at Walmart (>5$)Buy some sharp scissors or a knife (>2$)Cut a hole in the lid of the plastic box (your labor = free and rewarding!)Surround any sharp edges of the hole with ducktape(>5$)Add a litter pan inside (>2$)And bam, you have the same thing, home made, for a grand total of ~14$. LESS THEN HALF OF WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE CHARGING.So, if its worth paying 20.95$ more for a product that looks slightly nicer and was assembled when you got it to you, then by all means, buy this product. Power to you. You may also enjoy a drastic drop in the chances you will cut yourself on a home project!Personally, this looks like a great product to me, but I'd rather make it at home then spend 34.95$ on it."
78433,0,"This harness seemed to work as it claimed to, but my dog has very little hair on his chest/belly and so it chafed his armpits really badly (I even tried different sizes and they all chafed, so sizing wasn't the issue). If your dog has more fur or doesn't have sensitive skin, this may work well for you."
43993,2,"I have three cats, two of which are male. The two male cats pee all over the house. They pee on the bed, the carpet, the bath mats. It is not a physical problem (both healthy) but rather behavioral. I think they prefer soft surfaces to pee on. I have tried, quite literally, everything I can think of. They get lots of love, raw food, have two cat trees, tons of toys, and get outside time- but the peeing continues. I know I am up into the $1,000s when it comes to how much I have spent on things to fix this issue. I have been using Feliway plug-ins as well as spray for almost 2 years now. Right now I have 3 diffusers plugged in my house. I have never noticed a difference. I keep buying them because I keep hoping something will change, or that it will at least help them relax but have noticed no difference."
32855,1,All 3 cats love it. Gets enough water into them to keep them healthy even with dry food. Even Miss skittish Sassy has warmed up to it.
93585,0,"This is a great product and it has made walking my Dane SO much easier .... BUT .... the reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 is that it's a HUGE pain in the butt to get on and off. Had I known this I would probably not have bought it. If he sat nice for me it wouldn't be so difficult but then again, if he sat nice I wouldn't need it. LOL"
148571,2,"When I bought these pads at Amazon last year, a 50-pack was $11.99 -- now its $26.99! Does anyone know why this happened?The pads themselves are fine and work beautifully with the pad holder, but I'm protesting against this price.UPDATE APRIL 19, 2008In my earlier review, I downrated the product for the price, which went through the roof, but still paid respect to the quality.I just got a package from Amazon for $19.99 -- a better price. But the pads simply don't absorb. I tried a few and rocketed the package back to Amazon."
23904,0,"The filter works great for single-turtle tanks, but if you have a turtle you know they are messy creatures. It is more challenging to use with two turtles in the tank. Definitely keep the water level higher--more toward the max level rather than ""minimum"" level listed on the side of the filter, or it'll run the pump dry when the filters clog from gunk it's pulling from the turtle water. I've even had to pull up the filters, letting some water go by unfiltered, to get it to work sometimes. You must take the filters out and rinse WELL, FREQUENTLY (at LEAST every 2 or 3 days, with something like a pulsating shower head or sprayer of some sort that has some good pressure) or it will clog. Other than that and being a it nubbly and therefore challenging to clean, I really like this filter and have had two. They sound pretty and look great. The turtles love to try to climb them (as turtles do!) but it's just steep enough to prevent that at my turtles' current size (7"" and 6"")."
67754,2,not a very durable product. flimsey plastic. it worked in theory but the cat would fall in the toilet if he stepped on the plastic.
7627,2,The title should explain it all. Of anything I ever got for my puppy this and the potty pad are two of my biggest regrets. Useless and unnecessary. Never saw this spray work once....going to have to stuff it my purse and use it as a pepper spray substitute just to stretch my dollar.
85150,0,It certainly pulverizes pills. The only problem is that it is hard to the pulverized pill out of the container. The residue gets stuck in the grooves and makes it difficult to get out.
143961,2,"I have had this filter running for about three weeks now, Ever sense that second day of using the filter my tank has been cloudy. The filter is quiet but it is worthless if it does not clean the water properly. My old filter system has been in the tank less than two hours and the water has already cleared up. I would by no means by this product again or recommend it to anyone. I would love to have my money back and my fish I'm sure would love to have that two weeks of dirty water back."
160267,0,"They worked well for the first 4-5 months, and moved the water around my 28 gallon jbj well, however the last two weeks they no longer stay on my outlets. It's as if the diameter has increased so minutely that within 30 seconds of putting them back on they fall off. At first I assumed there was a bit of an algae buildup and it had gotten slick. I took them both out and did a thorough wash of them and tried again hoping I could fix the problem. I also tried a few other things, but nothing works. I also checked my water flow to make sure I wasn't overpowering them, but I can't imagine them even working with a lower flow rate then what I have. I'm hesitant to order them again, but the fact that they worked pretty well I think I can handle $13 bucks."
80891,2,"Was searching under ""cat collars"" for a spiked one. Somehow I received two, was charged for two and thought it was a ""prime"" order. It wasn't prime. I only ordered one and it is not a break-away (that's what makes it a cat collar. My cat climbs trees, fences and do not want risk of hanging.) I have made several calls /letters to both amazon and the seller, hoping to return but keep getting ""tough luck"" messages and then more (like this one) wanting me to rate my satisfaction. Hello out there....it's Not a cat collar! I'm not satisfied!"
10914,0,"I bought this product because after a lot of online research, it stated that Brewer's yeast and Garlic was the best way to get rid of fleas on a pet. They've been taking them for about a month now, and they're still managing to get fleas. I'm not sure if it's just ineffective on them, or I need to try a different brand.My dogs love it as a treat though. When I shake the bottle, they come running!"
41032,0,bought this gate to initially keep twin toddlers out of specific rooms of the house. It does extend quite far but the farther you extend it the weaker it gets. We had to extend it almost to its longest point to fit in our archway so my husband had to reinforce the gate with bolts ever so far. It is now permanently extended but it serves it purpose. We would have returned it if my husband didn't reinforce it because our twins would have definitely broke it.
94332,1,"Received pet tabs on schedule, the price was very good and they seem to work OK. My dogs like them too."
112955,1,I have a 1 y/o cat I got from the shelter. He let me put them on without any difficulty and he hasn't tried to remove them. They seem to be comfortable. They have been on for 2 weeks and only 1 has fallen off. My kids are happy because they have not been scratched and my husband is happy because our leather couch is protected. I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. I paid $23 at Petsmart but I will buy them online after this. It comes with 2 packages of glue which I think are similiar to superglue. I was happy today to find out that the one I used 2 weeks ago was still working for the replacement claw cover for today (it didn't dry up).
148524,0,"I have always loved these puppy pads, used with the Puppy pad tray, I think they are just the best. They hold more and they are easy to clean up. They were on sale this time for more than usual, so I bought 200 of then. My sister wanted to try them so she took 100 of them, but this time they are actually a slight smaller and don't fit the tray as well as usual. I don't know if they are irregulars or what but I was disapointed this time. I have a new puppy now, and since they don't fit as well as they used to, the puppy finds it too tempting to tare them up."
114456,0,i have a 30 gallon tank and needed some heat for my crested gecko during the winter. I bought this and now i am stuck with it. had to buy more wattage to keep the tank above 60.
54961,0,But the way it was packaged the bottles got broken in transit and the liquid all poured out. So there was nothing for me to try.
24420,1,"I am so grateful for this chew. My medium sized pit has gone through everything in minutes and he gets crazy OCD about chewing. He tore the green nubs off in minutes and thought for sure this thing was dead meat, but after that he settled into going after the ends of the bone. I am concerned with how sharp it gets but I keep checking it for blood and don't see any.. yet. He's probably had an hour a day with it for a week and it's not much worse for wear."
119630,0,"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it."
18207,0,"We have 3 kittens that like the u-shape platform but they don't use the platter shaped platform. This surprised me as I thought they would love the circular shape. As for the quality, we have a 20 year old stand that is shaped just like the u-shape on this one. The cats fight over or share the old stand before they will use this new one. The old one supposedly had catknip embedded in it so that may be why they like it or possibly the smell of our old cat who has been gone for a couple of years now. I bought this based on the reviews even though it is more than double the cost of stands we see in local stores. The quality appears the same, not double."
117715,2,"I used this on a two year old Maine Coon male with little success. Despite treating according to instructions, his gums remained irritated and red. When treated, he started coughing, much like clearing a furball. This caused us to stop using this product and switch to the CET mix with water. That has worked great."
108641,1,"I got this mat for my Bengal Cat Tristan who loves to jump on my counters. The mat has three setting, Low, Medium and High. The first time he jumped up and landed on the mat(I used the low setting)he went up in the air and re-landed on the mat with all four paws. He did not go into the kitchen for a day and we bribbed him with treats at that. He stood and staired at the counter but did not jump back up. The mat has a mild shock on low and we have leaned on it ourselves and gotten shocked but it is enough for him not to jump up again on it. It takes some time to break the habit,and I have other counters still to do. But it works great. The only down side it when leaving on the counters everytime you need to use the counter you have to turn off the mat and move it. I don't have a lot of counter space so this effects me more than some I am sure."
42978,2,"No sizing information was provided in the product description, so I ordered the large (largest size available) for my 55 pound boxer. There is no way that this shirt will fit him. Not even close. This shirt is clearly made for a ""large"" small dog.The shirt seems of decent quality, but I'll never use it."
199005,0,"Yes, of course my dog loves the chicken flavor, but despite of that, she really dislike to have foreign objects in her mouth (either my finger nor tooth brush). and i have a feeling that my dog is not the only one...she is really sweet and would never bite, but she moves her head around, and by the end of the procedure my hands covered in paste and dog's saliva. It takes long time and I am not even sure if that effective, because i cant get to deep in her mouth. I think im gonna stick with dental treats =)"
177528,0,"This is a pretty good magnetic cat door, but it is not raccoon proof. Empty kibble dishes and muddy water bowls, as well as personal observation, attest to the fact. I have seen that Cat Mate now has a product that works with a different type of magnet which they advertise as raccoon proof. It is their ""elite"" model. I haven't tried that yet. It is about another $25 in price and I have had difficulty finding one in stock."
80545,0,"Didn't really work for my yorkies. They stop barking momentarily ... but continue to yip. May work for others, just not mine."
144695,1,"I love these things! I have owned several over the years. The first one was lost, and the second one got run over. Let's face it, nobody like to bend over and over only to endure picking up a slobbery ball. Fido may not care, but most people sure do!I too, own both sizes. The short one is easier to control, but I like the longer one more because I can get more distance. This is something my dog likes because he is a big breed and loves to run.Well, bottom line is: buy one of these if your dog likes to chase a ball and you don't want to deal with touching a slobbery ball. By the way, I have not found it to be the case that only the Chuck-it balls work in these. On the contrary, I routinely use regular tennis balls with no issue at all."
150246,1,"This is very good priced, very simple, and does the job. If that is what you are looking for, then this is it."
142882,0,I have had three of these and they all last about a little over a year. You have to keep them very clean and it is much worse than just cleaning out a cat box now and then. The plastic trays which catch the waste are not too expensive but they add up. Just be aware of that.
12857,0,"Overall the cage was easy to put together and seems very well made, but this is not a good cage for rats. I have 4 rats and they all can squeeze through the bars to get out, also, this cage is very difficult to clean. Impossible to just wipe down platforms without taking everything apart. I think it would be perfect for a larger animal who was completely litter box trained. But not great for messy small animals."
62068,2,"I used Frontline Plus with no problem and then decided to try Advantix due to it's repelling of mosquitos claim...stupid decision ever!! I used Advantix Saturday morning on my 24lb. cockapoo (used only about half the tube...thank God). 24 hours later she was nearly doing somersaults trying to bite/scratch at her back...especially near the tail. I knew immediately it had to be the Advantix as she had never done this before. She acted like something was biting her. I was DEVASTED to know that I had used this product on her which was hurting her and without checking it out first! She didn't have a flea problem I was just using as a preventative (never again!). Drs. Foster & Smith recommended it so I bought it at the local pet feed store. An hour in to her symptoms I contacted the emergency animal clinic (it was Sunday night). I was told to bathe her with Dawn dish liquid and give her a Benedryl, which I did. The vet tech said that she didn't know if the bath would do any good as the product had been on her for more than 24 hours. I did bath her back real good and gave her a prescribed antihistamine. It didn't help right away. It took her a while to settle down. I was a mess! I kept a watch on her through the night. She seemed to have episodes of misery then it would settle down again. I called the vet the next morning he said continue the antihistamine and give her another bath and I did. She was eating and drinking ok, was not lethagic only miserable with what seemed to be burning or stinging. My vet said he does not recommend Advantix. He recommended me call Advantix to see if they could recommend anything else. I did call the medical emergency number on the back of the box and was forced to leave a number. Three and half hours later my call was returned. The vet tech said ""after two baths the product should be gone ... that it is not a systemic product ... that it stays on the surface of the skin."" She proceeded to defend the product and stated that a reaction to the product is VERY rare. Apparently, not that rare!!! It affected my dog didn't it!!! To me that's not rare! The only other thing she offered was to apply Vitamin E to the areas where the product was applied and try using a cold pack on the areas that are irritated. She also told me that it wasn't burning her, that the sensation she felt was like when your foot goes to sleep and it tingles. Excuse me ... how many dogs have they talked to too determine that?! This stuff is an insectiside with permethrin in it. After doing research on this product I couldn't feel worse. My baby is suffering. I'm praying that this will be the only damage done and we're just having to wait till this horrible product runs it's course. My vet said these symptoms could last a week. I don't know if I will ever put another topical product on my pup again or give her anything just because someone you trust recommends it. Check it out first puhleease!"
167127,0,"I just received my pair today. They were much larger then what I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing at all, in fact I was happy to see the size of them. I have two cats and this size for them will last probably two weeks. They are also a good weight, which means my larger cat will not knock them over, and that is a plus since I've been dealing with my cat knocking over any type of containers I give her.They do feel a bit cheap, not the best type of plastic, but its not bad. There could be much worse. It did come to me a bit dirty, probably just from packaging it. And the top is a bit lose on the food container. The cap on the water container also leaks, but once you flip it over and fill the bottom with water it is no longer a problem. If those two things wasn't broken I would give it a 5 star. Other then that I love it so far, and so do my kittys.We will see though, this is my first day using it."
190234,0,"I bought this product to hopefully solve a problem with one cat not using the litter box. This didn't solve the problem. However, I purchased the litter that contains this product. My cats love it. The litter didn't solve the one problem child either. But they all love the litter."
12607,2,"The general quality is average. I wanted to use on them to restrain a dog inside the house. This wants to attack one of our other dogs. Without going into detail, a sturdy lead is a must. I can only speculate about the sturdiness but I was not impressed. My larger concern was with the sewing.The lead is very inexpensive and probably worth the money for small dogs. I already own two leads by [...] and decided to simply buy two more from them.If you have large dogs and strength is an issue, I would consider the ""fordogtrainers"" approach."
43780,0,"-----------Haven't tried this for my dog yet, but was going to purchase until I saw the recent news articles in Google.-----------Diamond Pet Foods is expanding a voluntary recall to include puppy food over possible salmonella contamination, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The latest recall, announced Monday, covers Diamond Puppy Formula dry dog food manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods in Gaston, S.C. The puppy food was distributed in the following 12 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.This is the third voluntary recall for the company this month. On April 6, the company recalled Diamond Naturals Lamb & Rice dry dog food made over possible salmonella contamination. On April 26, the company expanded the recall to its Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Adult Light formula dry dog food.So far, no dog illnesses have been reported, the FDA said.Pets infected with salmonella can become lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever and vomiting, according to the FDA. Infected pets can also pass the illness on to other animals or humans. Pet owners also can contract the illness from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after handling the pet food.For more information about the recall, see [...]."
146088,0,"I went into this purchase for the IRIS pet food container thinking it was quite a bit less than it was - my mistake, but I'll tell you this; There is NO WAY I would knowingly pay $23.00 for a container to put a 5 pound bag of dry dog food in, even if it kept the food ""fresh as the morning dew."" That is the most outrageous price I have ever paid for anything. I would have sent it back for a refund, but have found that returning an item is most times, not worth the headache, and after trying to justify the price of returning it, I just decided to smile and keep it.As far as the container itself? It really was a very good item. Had it not been so expensive, I would be giving it at last a 4 star rating. It held the 5 pounds of dog food with no problem. In fact, it probably would have held a few pounds more than that. The food stayed fresh, I guess, though I find it a little difficult to judge without chewing on a piece myself. The ""aroma"" of dog food remained, because every time I opened the container, it was as overpowering 2 weeks later as it was the first day.I can't really give it a completely accurate review, as my little dog was put on canned dog food by our vet 2 weeks after we bought this container. If I had used it longer, I'm sure I could easily tell you how fresh the food stayed. I can tell you it is a very nice looking thing and I am still trying to find another use for it. It is a little too big for kitchen items, and a little small for my husband to use out in the garage. As much as it cost, I'm being a little picky about what to do with it, but, I'm sure I'll find something. It is very well made, nice looking, and has a really sturdy latch to keep it closed. This is an actual Amazon purchase too, so all of their exchange or return guarantees apply. All in all, in my opinion, it would have been a good purchase if it was a little less expensive. As it is, I would not even consider paying that much for a dog food container. I love my little dog, but spending $23.00, plus shipping on something to put her food in still feels more like a raw deal than a good one."
88222,0,"I purchased this fountain for my cat to replace one that was getting old. So far, my cat has not taken to it very well. I have only seen her using it two times in the past few weeks. I don't think it has a speed that she likes and it is very noisy. I have tried to encourage her to use it but she has preferred to drink out of a regular bowl that I placed in another room. I am dissappointed with the fountain and I may go back to using my old one."

The mouse is literally dead on arrival. I'm going to return it and reget the time and effort I spent ordering it. I don't like writing bad reviews for a product, but anyone ordering this needs to know what a low quality item this is."
152842,0,"I bought this at Petsmart. Its perfect for my 19 inch tall 125 gallon aquarium with goldfish (they grow big so its hard to find tank toys big enough for them to swim through that don't cost an arm and a leg). However when taking it into the house my husband lightly hit the side of the trunk with one of the legs and it snapped off. Its a bit of a drive to Petsmart for us, so since it still would stand with the leg missing, we put it in the tank anyways. The fish LOVE it. We will be getting another one for the other side of the tank. But we may bring bubble wrap to get it home in one piece. LOL."
40038,2,"I read a lot of glowing reviews for this box. I ran right out and got one. Bad idea. I liked it OK for the first day, but then the problems and failings became pretty evident.First off I couldn't get the large box, so I got the regular one. I don't think the large one would have been big enough either. I have a 3 month old kitten who is fairly small and the box was just about big enough for her at her current size.I have a 6 month old kitten who looks full grown and there is no way in heck this was going to work for him. He would go in and his butt would be hanging out the opening and he wouldn't even be hitting the box.Then there comes the 2 inches of litter. Well think about it. 2 inches of litter in a tiny box isn't enough for one cat, much less 2. I suppose this would work if you rolled it after every duty, but how helpful is that??Now comes the rolling part. No matter how I did it I still ended up throwing out some perfectly good litter that had sifted into the drawer with each roll.Consequently I now have 35.00 litter box that is 3 days old and will never be used again. i went back to a regular box and sifting liners that I can do every other day or so. Save your money!"
61132,1,"The dog I bought the bed for won't get in it, but the other two love it. I think she doesn't use it because it is a bit difficult for her to get out of it. She is a senior dog. The bed seems well made and is light weight. I haven't tried washing it yet, but it should wash and dry easily. I consider it a good value for the money."
195283,1,"Do not get me wrong this is a solid constructed product that I bought for my sump. It comes at a great price and pushes a lot of water. However, the pump does not come with a gauge to measure or change the water output. There is also no filter media that comes with this product either. Much to my disbelief I believe Rio no longer makes these products for the pump. I have had the product for a few weeks, and just recently made a filter media by purchasing a sponge filter for a larger pump. Upon purchasing and after a few cuts with some scissors the sponge filter works fine. If anyone knows where to find a gauge that would work I would greatly appreciate any info. Anyway the product works fine (even without the gauge) inside my 150gal Tanganyika Cichlid tank. Perhaps its because of the two 1200gph powerheads in the tank too, but I digress. Irregardless I gave it four stars since it does not include the gauge. I thought it should have been include for the price. Anyway I would recommend it. Sorry for being long-winded."
87517,0,"My cat is in the early stages of renal failure and I bought this as part of my efforts to find an appropriate food he would eat. Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored. Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked. I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews. There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet. Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating. One day at a time.So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans). If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try. If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review. Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then. After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat. Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable. It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal. My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well."

She has barely touched it in the four weeks she has had it. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is made well and maybe some dogs do like them, just not mine. So I'm still looking for something she can enjoy but not devour in 1 or 2 hours. Also tried one of the edible Nylabones, this she liked but it was gone in less than 10 minutes."

It works great as long as the battery is charged. 9 months later, it takes about 12 hours to charge and lasts about 24 hours.This summer we did have problems with it rubbing our dog's neck raw when it was very warm outside.And of course the dog has figured out when he doesn't have the collar on he can get away with doing things he shouldn't.So if you need continuous coverage, you might consider buying two collars."

69406,1,"I have an AquaClear50 and the powerhead attachment. This product is a refill cartridge for the attachment, it's basically a fiber sleeve for the inside of the attachment. The refill is great for mechanical filtration and after a week or so it sucked up a lot of the suspended material floating in my tank. However, I'm not a great fan of non-reusuable items so after this purchase I'll probably just buy a pre-filter sponge of some sort and put that inside the powerhead attachment. As long as it mechanically filters the water before it gets to the powerhead impeller it'll be ok."

126631,0,"My 8 pound poodle mix puppy loves stuffed animals. I bought the Kong squirrel hoping we could avoid the stuffing all over the living room scenario that happened after he chewed through the other dog toys he has had. I usually have to throw stuffed toys away after only a few minutes.Well, there was limited stuffing. But he chewed through the squirrel in a matter of days. He now is chewing through the fleece pouch that holds the squeaker. The squirrel and the squeaker are a bit of a mess but at least he is enjoying himself. And there is no stuffing. I threw out the squeaker so he wouldn't accidentally swallow it.Far from indestructible but I have yet to find a plush toy he doesn't get through. At least I didn't have to throw it away after only a few minutes like I usually do with stuffed toys that are full of that fluff. And there are no beady eyes, he likes to chew those off too and I am afraid of him swallowing them. I might get another Kong stuffed animal, they are the best I have found. But not perfect."
32006,0,"Well, my cat certainly does like this fountain quite a bit. It doesn't keep him out of the sinks, though. I think all he really likes is the flowing water. For that, you don't really need all the high-speed filtering. I eventually stopped using the filter, as I put distilled water in it in the first place and all the filter did was add to the slime factor. I will say I have not yet managed to pull the motor out for cleaning, as I'm afraid I'm going to break it. Even if I do get it out, I probably won't be able to get it back in and I'll have that noisy rattle everyone keeps talking about. So, I guess we'll keep using it until I break it, and then I'll get one of the cheaper ones that just bubble the water out. It's okay, but certainly wouldn't get it again."

36016,1,This works like a charm...even for my giant Great Dane. He has no problem with it except when he sees his dog friends and wants to run and pounce. After that he works at rubbing his muzzle on me or pawing at his muzzle to try and get it off. He got his revenge and chewed the clips on it. These are not made very strong because (I believe) they don't have to be. He can't pull that hard. I am now trying the Easy Walker harness which is made significantly stronger. It works pretty good and my dog doesn't resent it. Time will tell if I can keep using this or will have to buy another Gentle Leader and make sure to keep it out of my dogs reach this time

17858,1,"This citronella spray collar works great right from the first time we put it on our beagle. We had tried another brand of spray collar, and although it was a lighter smaller device, it sprayed a lemon scent and was a lighter spray that we could not hardly tell if it was working. Our beagle did decrease his barking a little, but not very much.This Premier SpraySense citronella collar is bigger and heavier, but not too big for our 30 lb beagle. The spray is heavier and more noticeable, but not enough to wet the dog or anything else around him. The first time he wore it outside, he barked once, was startled and looked around for where the spray came from, but did not bark again when outside for that period. The next time outside, same thing, one bark and that was it. Third time was no barking at all. Same with fourth and fifth time.We will only use the collar for when we let him in the back yard alone in the late evening or early morning, not all day. And I suspect that we will use it regularly for only for a short time (few days or a week) and he will be trained enough that we may not need it again. That happened with my sister's dogs; they got sprayed once that that was it. Now she only shows them the collar and they stop barking. (But I don't know that she uses the same brand collar, only that it was a citronella spray collar.)"
138445,0,"This filter works very well--the water turns out sparkling clean, and it has seemed to help knock down a bout of ich as well, in one instance. However, it is such a pain to set up, that in two years I think I've only used it maybe five times. It's a hassle to prime it. It has to have everything just right in terms of hoses and the filter perched on a chair with phone books and connections and finicky positioning and you reaching to hold the other end of it in place. It's very loud, and with it having to run all night to do a good job on my 125, I cringe at what my apartment-building neighbors must hear from the motor noise. I have to close my door to sleep through it. Whenever I get an inkling to use it, I peer at its coil of hoses in the dark cabinet and think of better things to do with my time.Overall, it's a good backup plan for green water or ich or exceptionally thorough tank cleanings, but far too much of a hassle to use as part of any regular cleaning regimen."
213676,2,"The case was ok as cases go. When I placed my Oster Classic 76 in the case, I could not easily close the lid. I had to use force to close the lid. I am sure that the plastic locking latch will fail prematurely due to this execessive strain. I am returning the case for a refund."

20791,1,"I didn't give it 5 stars because I have only used it once. However, I was VERY pleased with its performance. I didn't heat up (even though I used it continually for about 45 min) and was powerful enough to clip my terrier amazing coat."

69119,2,"I have had this cover for a little over 4 months and while it started out great, the material they use to wrap around the headrests has (for lack of a better word) dry rotted. I don't know if it was caused by the sun or the heat, but when installing it yesterday, the material just came apart. At first I though it had just come out of the slides, but upon inspecting it, the material is rotten. I can literally tear it apart with my fingers very easily. Great way to ruin a good product.I would have gladly paid an extra 5-10 dollars for this if they had chosen to use some high quality UVA proof nylon webbing, instead of this disgrace of materail they used. Plain string would have been a better choice.Only giving two stars because of the concept and rest of materials seem to be okay, but time will tell. I guess I will have to jury rig some new headrest straps. Maybe some alligator clips or something?"
182858,0,Maybe it is just my messy little kitty but there sure is alot of extra litter that falls between the kitty tent and the litter box. It is mostly under the ramp. I do love the fact that I haven't scooped litter in a long time!Sometimes the rake really struggles if your kitty likes to pee on the side of the box instead of right in the middle of the box like we would like. The clumping litter then clumps to the side of the box. I was using Fresh Step but now using Scoop Away. Scoop Away seems a littler better.I would buy this product again if I couldn't find a litter box that was less prone to messiness and the price was right.

It's low enough for adults to step over, if necessary, but moves easily for pass through."

(golden retrievers shed ... ALOT) and brushing her has always been a nightmare.Brushing her with this was a breeze! She sat there & let me brush her without a struggle. It felt like she was being petted.I was amazed how much undercoat fur it was getting out.. without scraping her skin like most rakes do.The size & shape is comfortable to hold.No sharp teeth to hurt the dog while brushing.It's rubber so if your dog tries to chew on it.. no sharp parts to hurt them.Super easy to clean.Very affordable - under 10 bucks!& it's cute.. its a little dog face :)Brush outside because the fur will be flying!

Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24. That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time. Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of. I can only imagine what the profit margin is..."

I read some of the other reviews that said it wasn't sturdy enough, but it seems very sturdy to me. I think it scoops better than anything else I've used. It stores perfectly, so no more storing the scooper in a plastic bag. I purchased biodegradable doggie waste bags to leave right next to the scooper so the entire area is cleaner.

They hold up well in the fridge, and are fairly easy to put on and take off. The only thing that threw me at first was the double rim on them, where the outer rim lies down and out from the can. The reason they are built like this is because it allows both large and small cans to be sealed. Once I got used to it, they seem normal. Again, it could be because I am used to the older platic ones that ""snapped"" on. I like these much better. Great design."
84603,1,We were going on Christmas vacation and needed something to make sure the cat was fed as most of our neighbors were gone as well.

The vet said the Frontline wouldn't work efficiently because of the effects of her skin allergies. Just a warning - i know that Frontline works well on our cat, so your pet probably could benefit from this only if it has normal, healthy skin."

130086,0,"There is only one ""name brand"" crystal product currently available and it is in almost every way inferior to the several brands sold here, doesn't really absorb well, and it is just as expensive, including the shipping, even when bought at Malwart. There is somewhat of a problem with the size of some crystals being too big for the scoopers.I prefer brands that don't come in these ridiculous industrial-weight plastic tubs. You can get Fresh Magic at Amazon in a cardboard box with just a heavy plastic bag holding the crystals.PLEASE DO NOT FLUSH this stuff (or any other cat litter, for that matter). It cause all kinds of problems with municipal waste water systems - if it gets that far and doesn't mess up your own drains."
83006,1,"This is the second Midwest Life Stages dog crate I have purchased. The first crate I ever purchased was a Petco brand that was of excellent quality. When my dog grew out of the Petco crate I need to purchase a larger one but didn't want to pay the cost Petco charges and decided on the Widwest Life Stages. I have been very happy with this particular crate. It is very sturdy and priced well. I have used this crate for a Weimaraner and Rhodesian Ridgeback. The Weimaraner is 73lb and the Ridgeback is close to 100lb, both are comfortable in this size."
120686,0,"I had high hopes this would make a big difference in our dog run, but I think our very hard ground (decomposed granite) might just need a more thorough approach. I did use it as instructed, and put a very thorough soaking on the entire area, and for the day if seemed to smell much better. But the next afternoon when it warmed up, they unsavory smell of dog pea was back. But for the cost, it was well worth the try!"

69298,0,"My 105 pound Dogue de Bourdeaux (he's a runt, lol) goes through 3-4 leads a year. He snaps them. I had been using this red/orange 30 ft cable that seemed to last longer than others I'd tried, but after he went through two of those in a relatively short amount of time, I did a search for &#34;indestructible dog lead&#34; and found this puppy. In the past, these twisted steel cable leads have failed relatively soon, but so far this one is holding up. I will report back if/when he finally snaps it. If it makes it more than 4 months, I'll consider it a winner. It's worth mentioning that the price is a good value."
19542,0,"I will preface this review by saying that the product is well made and arrived quickly. I was happy with the price and think it is well worth the cost for the right dog. I personally had a few problems with the product. Number one it did not fit my girl Lili well because she has a hanging belly and that made the harness ride up so that it was mostly lifting her upper body. Also the handles were not long enough, my dog is a Beagle mix and her legs are short resulting in my having to lean over quite a bit to hoist her up. I wouldn't be able to go any distance with her in this harness as it would wear out my back. I would also like to suggest that you get yourself one of those snapping leather pieces that wrap around the 2 handles to hold them together, it makes it a little more comfortable.In the end I had to take 2 bath towels and sew them together into a large tube and that worked better for me in my situation and was more comfortable for her."
167370,0,"After reading some reviews on DIY CO2 diffusers for my planted aquarium, I decided to pay for this unit because it was relatively cheap on sale, and I would have rather had a finished looking unit than a soda bottle rig.After trying to use the included packets to no avail, I read some Q&A; online and found that a majority of the Hagen packets included with the unit are expired. I had no bubbles for the first 24 hours, so I checked the packet and bingo - over 9 months expired.DIY recipe is easy - sugar, yeast, baking soda, and warm water! The packets included are useless, and you supply your own sugar and water if you buy this anyways.If you buy this unit it will be for a nice, finished canister (albeit small compared to a DIY 2 liter soda jug), and a ready to go diffuser/tubing unit. I'm glad I got it on sale, and it does what it's supposed to do with my own CO2 recipe."
73692,2,"As soon as I took the coat out of the sealed plastic bag, I knew we might have a problem. IT STINKS HORRIBLY! I washed it in soap, then soap and Oxy-clean, then soaked it for a week in soap, Oxi-clean and bleach, then sprayed it with Petastic (dog pee odor remover that really works great for its intended purpose) and the darned jacket still stinks as bad as the day we received it. And it is so cute on our pup...Tried to contact Guardian Gear about it -- they are out of business, or at least their phone is disconnected. The coat fits great and would provide a wonderful way to keep our pup dry when out in the rain, but the horrendous smell could kill her if she had to spend any time with the jacket in an enclosed space (like a car), as well as kill us just being around it.We once got a rubber dog toy in a plastic bag inside a box of Hartz dog bones that had the same awful smell and we just threw it away. Rather than do that this time, we would like to use this coat if we could rid it of the odor. It seems to be caused by the rubber used in the outer yellow shell. Any ideas? Write me at likesandyharleys@yahoo.com."
109513,2,"I read a great review of the product in The Whole Dog Journal but when I received the product it didn't look anything like the quality one shown in the magazine.

I do commend the seller for the quick service!"

I have already contacted the vet the following morning for him to be examined, but in the interim looked online for similar cases with other pet owners. To my suprise, there are lots of them and Seargent's has been all so ever slow to respond to the numerous incidents that have already occurred. So be careful, think twice and go through your vet first."

199614,0,"I, like everyone else, heard great stories about this amazing de-shedding tool, so I bought one and have tried it a dozen or so times on my American Eskimo dog. She looks like a giant snowball, an oversized Pomeranian or a miniature Samoyed for those of you who have never seen one - and as you can imagine, she has LOTS of hair and sheds tumbleweeds year round.When I got this brush out of the package, the first thing I did it run it down my own arm to make sure it isn't painful like those pin brushes (which I bet you will stop using once you try them on yourself). It it actually fairly uncomfortable when you test it on yourself, because the blades are very sharp, so even though they are aligned in such a way as to provide a largely flat grooming surface, they still scrape and scratch quite a bit. That being said, dogs have thicker, tougher skin than people (well, most dogs) and can handle a bit more roughness. So I tried it out on my Eskimo.I fully admit that it did work as advertised, for which I'll give it credit. The undercoat comes out little by little, in tiny poofs of wispy hair. If you groom for 15 minutes, you're completely covered in wispy hair that is soft and impossible to gather up and throw away. After 5 minutes she was noticeably uncomfortable,after 10 minutes she was shewing on me and acting fussy, after 15 minutes she started making little whining noises, and after 20 minutes she was practically biting my arm in annoyance. She never likes grooming much, but she really did not care for this tool. It rips the undercoat out in small bits. I wouldn't care for it either if it were me. I did get a lot of hair out of my dog, but she wouldn't come to me for half a day afterward because she appeared to feel mistreated by the grooming session.Each successive session was about the same. I knew I wasn't really hurting her, but rather causing her quite a bit of discomfort, so I made sessions 10 minutes or less after that to minimize the soreness that apparently develops from the tearing out of the fur."

15984,0,This product is basically very good and does what they advertise. I've used both buttons(tone&stimulation)with success. I try to use only tone and have found it works great. My dogs respond to the tone but on occasion I have had to use the other. The problems with this product are as follows; 1)the buttons stick..and if your in stimulation mode can cause pain for the dog(and anxiety for you). 2)The batteries go fast so turn the unit off if you're not training. 3)The collar is NOT waterproof. My dog loves playing in the sprinkler..when she's done so is the collar and it's off to the store to buy another $100 unit. Overall I recommend it. A lower price would be nice :)
213212,1,"Orbee toys have quickly become a favorite for both our six year old Old English Bulldog Harley and his partner in crime a six month old puppy of the same breed named Elvis. If you look at the 10 most wanted list in any post office you're bound see our two Bullies posted as the worst crimminal ""Aggressive Chewers""The material used to make these toys is quite unique in that it's softer and more pliable then Kong toys - another favorite.Yet despite the softness Orbee toys hold up well - although like any toy for aggressive chewers they're not indestructible.This ball is well designed with the pooch in mind - and for us, that's a huge plus.1) The large ball attached to a smaller one makes this toy perfect for most any size breed.2) The 3 Dimensional raised parts of the globe are made of a denser material.These raised textured parts add extra chomping ecstasy while massaging gums and cleaning tarter of their teeth - great for teething pups!3) Being hollow - you can really crank up the crazy.Just add a cookie, treat of even the filler made by Kong. Which I'm pleased to see has a new protein based formula free of gluten.4) Excellent quality - the rubber is nice and thick. The unique shape makes this toy easy for your pooch to hold with their paws and chomp away.5) This is in every way a ""dual purpose"" as it works just as well as standard ""Ball"" and ""chew toy"" so you get two toys in - a great design.The pink and blue is certainly eye catching which no doubt is irrelevant to our beloved dogs. But the bright colors and fun contrast make these easy to find under sofas, chairs and tables. All the places dogs LOVE to roll these just to watch us go the through the misery of laying down on our stomachs to fish them out for them.Like all toys of this nature - play time should be supervised.Should a rip or tear occur it's time to retire the Orbee to that vast burial ground of half chewed Nylabones and once adorable and cute stuffed bunnies and other critters - that now resemble road kill.This Orbee Tuff large toy offers hours of fun at a very affordable price. We've learned (the hard way) to buy two of each toy - in order to save the world from full blown Bulldog Armageddon.At these discounted prices these are a must have dog toy.These also qualify for Prime so lightening fast two day shipping is 100% free.Making these toys even more affordable. Perhaps more importantly getting these toys into the waiting jaws of our beloved dogs who have us wrapped around their little toes.5 PAWS UP!"

41047,0,"I am using this as a gate for an archway between my kitchen and the rest of the house, for a small puggle. It is easy to install, took 5 mintes. The slots are wide. First day i had it up my dog (puggle 15 weeks) got her head stuck in it, 2nd day she got all the way thorugh. Had to place extra rods in the space to stop her from getting stuck again. Works because it is cheep and extra wide, but if you have a small dog/cat or baby.. be careful. They wil get stuck"
16607,1,I bought this at the recommendation of a friend. I have been using a baby gate for years now in my kitchen but wanted to give my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel more room. I want her to be able to go wherever we have no carpeting but there are so many doorways to gate off so she has been limited to a small part of the kitchen. That has been a nuisance for us because it's a high traffic area so opening & shutting the gate is a pain. One opening into the living room is just too big for a gate so I felt I had no other options.Then I received my new Pawz Away Instant barrier. I have 2 door ways I wanted to stop her at so I bought an extra barrier. I set them on the floor where I didn't want her to pass. She only had to be corrected once! At first I had it at the lowest setting so she didn't hear the warning soon enough & she ran right through. But after I turned it up she has stayed exactly where I want her to be. Even though she's a really sensitive dog she seems comfortable with the barrier system. I was afraid she'd become fearful of going anywhere near it but she has no problem with using all the space she's allowed. If I'm in the area I don't even bother putting on the collar now.I wish I had gotten one of these long ago!

There is only so much liquid the crystals can deal with before they stop working.This is now my vacation litter box. It is too expensive to use daily. I am going back to scooping."
164263,2,"Well, I read a few reviews and gotta admit that I was sold based on the manufacturers words rather than the folks who bought the product. Sure it warms up (and ""warm"" is really being generous) but it just doesn't stay warm, especially for outside use. My inside cat sat on it once (after I put pressure on the unit to get it to warm up) and my cat (who is super arthritic and loves heat) jumped right off. It just wasn't warm. I bought two extra pads for the ferals I take care of outside but we'll see. The cord is a good construction and nice and long. The pad cover is a good design, easy to remove/clean and soft. But, it's the actual function of the pad that sold me and it just doesn't deliver. The ferals may prefer their straw than the boxes with the pads. Will keep you posted but for the amount of money, I wouldn't buy this product again. I recommend you save your money and try something else."

I only had room in the bathroom to put a litter box, just between the toilet and tub. Because of how packed in it was, rolling the litter box was not that easy. If you have enough room to roll it over easily, this is a great product. But, if you don't have much room then rolling it will be a problem, so you may want to check out other options."

After about five months now it still works fine. It is very dirty and can't really be washed, but since it's in the garage we don't mind too much. Generally a good purchase. Hope it holds up for another winter."

141032,0,"My baby is very a lazy, non-frisky, over-affectionate type of cat. She's not old or fat, just lazy. Her idea of exercise is to squirm around on her back while humans pet her tummy. She completely ignored this thing at first, but after a few minutes she started playing with it when I held it directly over her head. She still prefers sleeping to da bird. But she'll happily try to grab for it (and she tries to eat the feathers) as long as I hold it right next to her. She usually goes back to ignoring it after a couple of minutes. This is more success than I've had with any other toy. I did see the earlier reviews about the fiberglass on the stick - I've been holding the stick with a cloth or heavy duty rubber glove."
16765,2,The collar does not work that well. It does not spray all the time when barking.
155579,0,"... especially if you want your feeder to hang OFF your deck rather than OVER it. Due to the way the rail overhang is structured on our deck (with the lip for the mount facing out) the only way to position the pole is OVER the deck -- the birds come and create an unholy mess that we'd much prefer having drop below (off the deck) out of sight and mind. This would not be an issue had the unit been designed to swivel. Alas, it is a fixed position unit so we are stuck using this to hang a potted plant.Further, this mount is suitable for small feeders ONLY.Glad it wasn't too expensive and because it is well built, it does make for a decent pot hanger..."

77196,0,"I was so excited to get this gate based on the reviews. I just got 2 dachshund puppies and the girl is well-adjusted and remains in the gate. The boy, however, has severe separation anxiety and will do just about anything to get out of a confined area and find me. With the 8-sided arrangement, even with the gate door locked tightly, he was able to pull it open and squeeze through. If the gate is against a wall, he uses his teeth to drag the panels close together so he can scale up the 2 adjacent sides. He did ok for a day or two when I changed it to 5-sided, but then he figured that out also. Same with a 4-sided (pulls it into a diamond shape). Even now as I'm typing (sitting on the couch no more than 10 feet from them) I have it in a 4-sided arrangement against a wall, and no less than 40lbs anchoring each exposed side, and he is still able to drag it around a little bit. If I just have the girl in there, she does great, so I think it is just this particular dog that has issues (he even chewed through two of the wire rods on the side of a plastic crate and squeezed through the openening)."
42786,1,"We have an 8 month old beagle mix. We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that. My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's. She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well. She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself. We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back. She loves it! She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy. We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing. We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too! Whoever was selling the puppy chow would take awhile for it to arrive but this one usually shows up in a day or two. Do wish this was available at our local market though!"

190631,0,"I recently purchased this habitat to house Fire Belly Toads. What sold me was the split level flooring, allowing for a part land and water enclosure.I love the split level flooring, it definitely works great for creating a half water/land environment. There is plenty of room in the front lower half for two small/medium sized decorations and some fake low lying aquarium plants. Another highlight is that the 'Tetra ReptoFilter For Frogs, Newts & Turtles' is a PERFECT fit on either side of the split level floor (far right or left back corner). This is extremely convenient and a small fake aquarium plant will conveniently hide the filter from view and silence the 'splash'. The 'land' portion of the habitat comes with a removable plastic 'tree trunk' hideaway and two feeding bowls in the shape of two leaves (that can attach to the trunk). I chose to use only one for dropping in the occassional waxworm the other we just tucked away.There is very little to like about the lid for this habitat. It can be difficult to open and it certainly makes feeding time more 'interesting' (you have to lift up the entire lid to get anything in there). At the same time, I do like that the lid has no movable parts and is difficult to remove because it means our 4 and 7 year old are less likely to let critters (frogs and/or their food) escape. It also ensures that they aren't placing items into the tank that don't belong in there, since the habitat is in their bedroom. The mesh wire top is nice but you'll need to avoid purchasing 'teeny tiny' crickets as they will find their way out (medium and large sized are fine). I don't understand the big 'rounded' part of the lid. This is where the 'not included' light should reside and the packaging claims it will fit most florescent light fixtures... however, I have no idea how a light would stay suspended within this hollowed out space (there is no hardware included) nor have I found a light that appears to be a good fit for this lid. As a result, I simply have a small external light resting on the outside of the mesh screen cover.What I don't like about this habitat is that the the plastic scratches very easily. In fact, mine was already all scratched up on the inside though I didn't notice until I had finished decorating my habitat (without contrasting colors I couldn't see the scuff marks). I have a feeling that this was a used habitat as I was very careful with adding in the aquarium gravel (I bought my habitat from a Petsmart store, not this seller). I also dislike that the big bulbous and non-functional part of the lid get's in the way of viewing the habitat! We have this up on the kids dresser and even the little one has to bend down to look inside. You don't realize this to be a problem when holding the product at eye level or from any of the well angled pictures shown of the habitat. If the lid was slightly better in design this would definitely be a 4 or 5 star review. That said, I still recommend this as a great starter kit for anyone who is looking to set up an impressive Fire Belly Toad habitat with minimal effort. 5 Fire Belly Toads will fit fine in the large Habitat and there is plenty of water to throw in a few feeder fish (we have 6 minnows in ours), nothing fancy since they may wind up a snack."
46464,0,"got thisfor my rabbit because she was chewing the metal of our old water bottle (to the chagrin of my lady). diameter of hole is pretty huge tho, and she tended to spill half the water on her head. notreally a problem, but she'd go through a full container once a day, which made me worried she wouldnt have any water while i was away at school."
169694,1,Very nice product. The pets cant get into them and the food stays fresh. This way i can have my cat and dog food in the landry room and not in the garage so its easier. The wheels help too when needing to move the bins for cleaning and such. Would recommend 100%
59452,0,I had this product last year and it worked wonderful. Don't know that it came from the same company but I do know that we had 2 weeks left before our dog was due for her next dose and was finding ticks stuck. I also noticed that on these boxes there are no expiration dates and the ones I bought last year there were so I am wondering if they are out dated or what is the problem this time!
49552,1,This comb works very well and even works on our very fussy cat!!Catches a lot of fleas very quickly...
121702,1,"I have tried all kinds of hay, especially timothy of various brands, since that's supposed to be the best for rabbits. How much money I've wasted! Even with the herbs in it, they turn up their noses at any kind of timothy. Same story with numerous other kinds of hay until I found the Oxbow oat hay. They love it, and munch it on and off all day long. Occasionally we'll get some bags that are a green cut of the oat hay and they'll look at me like ""Hey-ho, what's THIS?!"" (if you have rabbits, you know that look). Apparently, they only deign to dine on yellow oat hay. So try the yellow if your buns won't eat the green, or vice versa. My local Petsmart now carries the oat hay, but I order it from various places online since it's about half the price and I have to order their pellet food online anyway. Just wish it came in bigger bags like the timothy does, since they go through it quite rapidly!"
80011,1,I have used this many times during water changes on my 75 gallon aquarium and it works great! I will always keep a bottle of this around.
185931,1,Awhile ago I had ordered the smaller peek-a-prize pet toy box. My 2 kitties loved it but I wish I would have ordered this larger size instead. More fun for them. Now I have one upstairs and downstairs. I only put pingpong balls in the box and they have so much fun getting them out and then chasing them around the house. I like this size also because there is more room for them to lay on top of it. I really love the SmartCat toys.
182297,1,"Well there isn't much to add that hasn't been covered already, so I'll contribute what I can. This is far and away the highest quality cage on the market. The Marshall version appears to be the same or extremely similar, but as I haven't seen one in person I can't be sure.The main cage panels (doors, sides, rear and top panels) are finished with what appears to be a base powder-coat with a blue-grey painted finish. The remaining panels (shelves and main floors) are finished with a heavy-duty paint that has the look and feel of a vinyl coating.Construction is very straightforward, although the directions may leave something to be desired for anyone not accustomed to do-it-yourself style projects. Yes this cage can be put together by one person - although an assistant would make it infinitely easier. It took me just under an hour to complete. Which brings up a few important details: The cage in the package is about 100 lbs. (45 Kg). Unless you can manage that weight by yourself, you will need some help. Also, the primary panels (doors, sides, back, etc) that create the frame of the entire cage have threaded openings in various locations. These are used to secure machine screws that hold everything together. While the openings and all components lined up properly, I ran into a couple threaded openings that were painted over. As a result, it took considerably more effort to tighten those screws properly. I suggest that most people use a cordless drill/driver on those screws (and only those - handle the rest by hand).Aside from these rather minor things I'm very impressed with the quality. For roughly $200 you expect a certain, minimum level of quality and this cage definitely has it and then some. Even before it's put together, each component feels solid and well built. Once constructed, it feels virtually bomb-proof. I'm very satisfied with it and so are my 2 girls who call it home. Massive amount of space inside especially with the full-width doors.If you're serious about caring for your ferrets, look no further."
98483,0,"The product helped the older larger dogs a LOT more than what was offered locally or at the vet, but didn't kill ALL the fleas. I was just grateful that they were no longer scratching 24/7. However, when we treated Mom's 9 pound, 9 month old Yorkie-poo he had a severe reaction and went into shock and we thought we were going to lose him. He lived thanks to the vets suggestions. I'd test with a drop and wait at least 4-5 hours to make sure yours can tolerate it because it can't be thoroughly removed from their systems. If a reaction occurs you need to bathe them immediately with lots of soap and water to dilute what's on the skin and hasn't been absorbed, encourage them to drink lots of water, and keep them walking and awake until they start to rebound from the effects. As far as our vet knew, there is nothing else that can be done to save a pet from a severe reaction to any of the drops that are out, so treat them like you would yourself with any chemical you put on your skin and just try a tiny bit first."
212091,1,This is an excellent product and a good price compared to what I can find locally. It is shipped timely and by ordering 4 at a time I can save around $15. My vet recommends this spray as relatively harmless and says I can use it daily if needed. I have 5 dogs and summers here in South Texas are rife with fleas.

142816,0,My first unit broke after 6 months than littermaid charges you $10.00 for a new one which broke after 1 month so another $10.00 for another and it broke in one month so they charged me $5.00 for the last one that broke about 6 months later. Well I have 4 broken units sitting in my garage.....or so I thought. I ordered a mega unit last night so i figured i would check these units to see what i could salvage from them. Surprisingly 2 of the 4 units are working again!!! so now i have 3 working littermaids. When yours stops working all of a sudden i suggest unpluging and letting them sit for a while before assuming they are dead like i did.I will see how things go and update this post accordingly.

126490,2,"Melinda Lucas has it exactly correct. The new Petromalt formulation for cats is horrible. Purchased 6, 4.4 oz. tubes on Oct 1, 2011, assuming (incorrectly) that I was getting the ""Real McCoy"". I would have given this new formulation zero stars if possible. Have been using Petromalt for decades, and my cats would beg for it as soon as they saw the tube. They won't touch the new formulation which is a drastically different chemical cocktail. My neighbors cats won't touch it either, and they have also used the previous formulation with great success. Sentry gave no indication on the packaging that it was a new formulation. The packaging states ""The Original Hairball Relief for Cats"". This is not the original by any means, but I doubt that they can be legally taken to task. I will no longer purchase any Sergeant's Pet Care Products. The hunt is now on for an alternate."
61262,0,"I ordered this unit as a replacement for an older unit (to be truthful, I have had several over a period of 8 years). It takes about a half hour to assemble the unit. I threw my old one out in the container this unit came in. Throwing out the box was rather premature, beause today the new unit just stopped working after only 6 or so days. The raking arm that travels forward to front of box just stopped in the front position and will not budge. Now I have to call Amazon and have a replacement sent, and use that packaging to return this unit. In addition, I don't think the unit will even fit in the box because of the rake being raised at the front of the unit. Amazon is being very helpful, but after reading all the negative reviews on the product, I wonder if I should just ""cut my losses"" and look for a new manufacturer. I have had many issues with LitterMaid over the years, but basically the unit works as intended. Lots of variables will throw the smooth operation of the unit off, many of the problems have been mentioned in the users' reviews. But for the money you get a good deal. That was, for me, up until today!"
80990,0,"My mini schnauzer mutt loved this ---really LOVED it--- except she managed to tear it half apart after two days. I was hoping it would be like the squirrel I got for her two years ago, which she still plays with. (It doesn't squeak anymore, but at least it's still intact.) BTW, she never figured out how to take out the eggs, although she's very smart. They came out from her chewing at it, then she played with them separately."

Since when is Citronella spray hazardous?"
53342,2,This is a good looking feeder unfortunate the container is glass and is heavy. I filled it stuck it on a window it seemed secure but when I closed the window it slid to the bottom pooped off and shattered on my deck. I would like to find another container and try again.

61390,2,"**************AUGUST 2010 update: ADD 1/4 CAT'S PRIDE FOR PERFECT FUNCTIONING OF LITTER MAIDs. Cat's Pride is an unconventional brand of cat litter that is lighter and clumps harder. So if you use 3 scoops of conventional cat litter + 1 scoop Cat's Pride--this results in extra-clean functioning of a Litter Maid. In my experience the best conventional cat litter is Scoop Away. The worst (most gooey) is Fresh Step. However perhaps when adding Cat's Pride this doesn't matter. Currently I use 1/4 Cat's Pride + 3/4 Best Friends (Price Chopper brand). Adding Cat's Pride almost eliminates gooing up the rake. However too much Cat's Pride will stick hard to the bottom. After experimenting, I find that 1/4 Cat's Pride works best.**************I suspect that the few reviewers who like this Elite LitterMaid may be feeding their cats only dry food, which in my experience makes for a short and uncomfortable life. The rake scrapes right along the bottom. Result: almost every time a cat makes a pee, it is going to jam.Try yourself living on crackers and jerky and see what happens to your skin and pancreas. A tablespoon of dry food daily with 'tarter control' is good for their teeth, but otherwise, give your cats only fresh or canned food please. Walmart and most supermarkets have a house brand of canned pet food that is not expensive.The steel rake could have made this the best LitterMaid--but instead it's the worst. Also Amazon currently has the wrong description.Usually, a LitterMaid works as best as can be expected at a reasonable price. Only problems: 1. Rake clogs. 2. Any cat box must be scraped. 3. LitterMaid's manufacturer is in denial that the box must be scraped.So, I was hopeful about this model with a stainless steel rake. But, while improving this feature, they insisted on changing the rake motion. So as I say, when the cat pees, the rake jams.Also, with all LitterMaids, you need to be careful when you remove the waste bin. The lip can snap at you, flinging cat litter in the eye. With this model, the lip of the waste bin fits very snugly and is an extra nuisance to replace.Also the current Amazon description reads:""Self-cleaning litter box for extra-large cats...""Even if this 'elite' model worked properly, it is definately not for 'extra-large cats.' You may risk them shooting over the sides. I got this at Target for $[...]. I took it back. Walmart has a slightly bigger all-plastic one for $[...]. However Amazon currently has the largerLitterMaid LM900for only $[...] with free shipping. In my opinion, this is worth the few extra dollars. Perhaps your current cats are small, but a LitterMaid can last several cat generations. Also, the larger the box, the more leeway you have to be lazy in the scraping.I personally like most LitterMaids because, if you have a minimum of 2 of them, plus one per cat, then usually you can ignore the cat box when you feel like it. Using scoopable cat litter also produces much less waste than old-fashioned cat litter.Notes.1. RE-USING THE 'DISPOSABLE' WASTE BIN. The same oblong waste bins seems to fit all Litter Maid models. They are made of flimsy frosted plastic but with slight care, each one can last for months. If you throw them away after each use--where are you going to throw them? With or without these bins, a double-lined trash can is needed. There is no point to throwing them out with each use.2. There is also no point to using the waste bin covers at all. All these do is get in the way.3. LITTER STICKING TO WASTE BINS? If so, in the bottom of the bin place one or two folded sheets of newspaper, creased at each fold, so as not to unfold. The newspaper prevents sticking to the waste bin."
28724,0,"My dogs are both pullers (large aussie mix and a greater swiss mountain dog). This harness is great for smaller dogs, but mine are 70 and 110bs. I got a dog trainer and we use springer prong collars. A few jerks with that and your dog will not get out of hand! We literally had them at our sides and under control in less than a hour. I must say that you should have a professional teach you how to use a prong collar correctly. I won't let my mom use it when she takes one of them for a walk because she's a spaz with it and incorrect use can hurt the dog and confuse them."

I'm happy to have this product around and will continue to use it, but it does not cure all cases of unwanted destruction. (Is any destruction wanted?) I suspect crating the animals when they cannot be supervised is the only solution in my case. Bitter Apple really tastes horrible and I have learned to wash my hands thoroughly after application. Yuck!"

98789,1,This is good stuff. I treated my pets and then my whole house. It doesn't get rid of every single flea for the whole seven months but it does work well. I bought some stuff for my yard that will help tremendously. It does have a smell but it goes away in a few hours.
129900,0,"The sticky tabs that came with the product doesnt work well. After a couple of rubs from my 16 LBS kitty, it was knocked off the wall. The product wasn't too solid, kinda flimsy, so the tabs couldn't hold it flat against the wall. I ended up buying super velcro tabs, which worked well, that is until kitty knocked it off, again. But it did last a couple of months this time. He likes it and uses it alot. If I didn't have to keep pinning it back on the wall, it could've gotten a 4 rating, and if it wasn't a flimsy rubber-plastic-like material, it would've gotten a 5. The catnips included doesn't do anything for kitty, and he's a catnip-junkie! I would say don't waste your time putting catnip in the groomer, just give it to him in a regular catnip toy, it didn't increase him using the groomer."

111340,0,"I do like that this managed to both clump and not be made out of clay, so in that regard it's great. But it seems corn is about the dustiest material you can make cat litter out of, because it is absolutely not dust free as claimed. A cloud of dust rises whenever the litter is slightly disturbed. In adition it smells ""all natural"" - like weird, food-y corn smell that then gets mixed with the smell of cat urine, which it's not very good at masking. It didn't track terribly and my cats used it readily. But I think the best clumping non-clay cat litter is Scientific Professional cat litter, so this one isn't the world's best after all."
63088,0,"This cube has an opening to the inside on each of its sides: 6 sides, 6 openings. For an easily bored dog, this toy doesn't last long to hold interest with this many openings. So, I sewed closed 4 openings completely and 1 opening only partially. As a result, that leaves 1 opening untouched and 1 opening partially closed. After this modification, I placed treats and many small plush toys into the cube.My 6yr old maltese and 2yr old poodle mix were entertained longer because the cube was a challenge for them to find the treats. My maltese found out that removing the toys helped him find the treats better. My poodle mix has a long nose and he navigates between the toys within the cube to find the treats. Both can be heavy chewers especially when bored, so I usually keep the cube stored away if I'm not present.As always, they now get alot of exercise with this cube by rolling the cube, digging at it, burying their face into it, throwing it around (hoping for the treats to fall out), yanking the toys out."

Not to mention that you have to turn it off & unplug the thing to take the top off!I called the company who suggested using dish detergent in the water! The last I checked, dish detergent created bubbles...the one thing the manual said to get rid of! On top of that, they would not talk further about giving us our money back!

190226,1,"I brought our cat &#34;Mittens&#34; to the local veterinarian because he had recently started urinating on our walls. I assumed that he had a urinary tract infection. The veterinarian ran a series of tests, than after presenting me with a bill for $350, told me that there was nothing wrong with our cat, other than anxiety.She recommended that I try using this product, along with another one called Feliway Diffuser, a plug-in device that emits a synthetic copy of your cat&#8217;s natural facial pheromone. Between the two products, my cat has resumed using the litter box exclusively. Obviously, it's hard to say if it's one or the other product, or both that have resolved the problem, but I can say that it's a pleasure to no longer have to clean urine off of the walls and carpeting. If you have a cat that's urinating outside the litter box, try this product and the diffuser before spending hundreds of dollars on tests that may prove to be unnecessary."

15754,0,"I bought this item for my 2 year old Shepherd for correction of her aggressiveness towards other dog and bikers. I tested the stimulation on my foot to see how uncomfortable it can cause. At level 3, it's enought for me to hate it. At 6, I got two points of burn sores--though very light. I was stupid enough to press the button while setting it to level 6 to see the effect on my own. It hurts like hell! However, the thing I am complaining is that it's very hard to fit my dog's neck well without being either too tight--uncomfortable for her or too loose--helpless and without any effect. I unleashed my dog at a college campus and sat there to supervise her. She went to smell some cake or cookie crumbs on the ground and started to eat. I pressed the button with level 3 on. No effect whatsoever. I kept pressing, nothing happened and my dog ate one piece already. I could have used my voice command loud to stop her. I thought it was not strong enough so I set it to 6. Nothing happened. Then I had to ran towards my dog & say ""NO""...that stopped it. A minute later she walked towards the food again. I used both voice command and the remote--and this time the stimulation worked (in a delayed manner). It worked at the time when my dog turned away from the food :( AND guess what, it caused my dog scream in pain and jump!! What the heck!! My poor dog had to suffer this unnecessary and unstable and untiming shock?!! If she were to run out of the street full of traffic, before the signal reaches her, she'd be in an accident already. This is very bad!I just figured out that it's probably because the hair was in the way so the metal doesn't tough her skin. Lucky that they provide another set of metal with smaller and longer end probes. I haven't tried it yet though I have switched. I guess this thhing works better for short hair or no hair dogs. Also it works while my dog was like 80-100 yards away--that's why it deserves a 3 star.PLEASE TEST ON YOUR OWN FIRST BEFORE GIVING IT TO YOUR DOG!!! I never go beyond number 4 to make correction from now on. Even pitbull probably can't take level 6!"

Lighter weight, and didn't seem to seal as well.This is my third one - building a dog door for my patio slider. The basics are still there - but much more flimsy then the brown one.

Sometimes I can smell the litter when the cleaning process opens the lid of the bin, but only for a couple of minutes. Often these filters don't stay stuck on the top and fall into the bin. I don't know if that matters, it should still be absorbing odor, but that is my only issue."

The hooks that come on the chain are rusting. Working with the hooks and the eyelets was a little awkward and I broke out some pliers.

54902,0,"I ordered 3 packages of this and one of them was made mostly up of alfalfa flakes, not hay. My guinea pigs didnot seem interested in eating the flakes, so I went through that bale very quickly. I guess it served as extra bedding."
102794,0,I bought this thinking my babies would absolutely adore it but to my shock they did not even get curious like they do with everything. I kept it around the house just until my return date was due on Amazon to see if they would warm up to it but they didn't.The only reason i did not give this a one star is because it really is a good price for what you are buying and of course just like humans not all animals are the same and don't like the same things. This might work perfectly for someone else but for my family it didn't.Hard to say if i recommend this because i don't consider my cats fussy so i guess its kind of a gamble whoever orders it.
87098,0,"I recently started feeding the birds in my neighborhood and put up some little bird houses and some feeders around. I bought this feeder because it would bring the birds to my window and let me watch them up close.The feeder is a bit small and it took a while for the birds to figure out how to get into it. I would put seeds around the feeder just to attract them towards the general area. After they figured it out, then all the birds flocked to the feeder. It was great, I would refill the feeder every other day and the birds were happy as frogs.After a few weeks the feeder started to split down the middle. Unfortunately it has split completely in half and I am using duct tape to keep it together. I think that it's not a design flaw, but whomever put it together before they shipped it to me did a poor job. In any case, I will probably order another one just because with all the duct tape the feeder looks pretty ugly right now. So I'll get another one. If it's not put together right this time, I will send it straight back and get a refund.Oh yeah, this must be designed for small birds like sparrows. Some blue jays and cardinals have come to mine from time to time, but they seem agitated because it's hard for them to get into the feeder. It's really funny watching the little sparrows get into the feeder and guard their food like gladiators!"
124274,2,"I used this on my cat just like the directions said. For 24 hours any time someone would touch the area that the flea medicine was distributed, she would freeze, then run under the bed. This product caused her to be very sensitive, and definetely not acting like herself, so we washed it off with dish soap and the symptoms slowly disappeared. I read the other comments of what this product has done to cats and I guess my cat is one of the lucky ones.I am now currently looking on line for non-chemical, more natural remedies....after all my cat went through, this product didn't even get rid of the fleas."
47780,0,"This bird feeder worked great for about the first 2 years I owned it, however now, the roof leaks water through the holes that you can hang it with, and the wood on the side has cracked and that now allows rain/bugs to get inside the feeder and ruin the seed. Looking to replace this with a metal/plastic unit that won't split and that has better roof overhang."
101295,0,"Bought this for a 50 pound dog who is not a tough chewer, the dog managed to get a small piece off and left teeth marks in the ""bone"" part of the rib.No suggested for dogs who chew anything other then extremely lightly. Not sure why the sell a large version of the toy without making it tougher. Oh well, if you are buying this toy for a medium-hard chewer I suggest : Galileo Bone Souper or Nylabone Big Chews"
187167,1,purchased this for crate training our puppy.the adjustable inside panel is wonderful. puppy is growing sooo fast and being able to custom size the interior space for him is fantastic! we like the fact that the crate folds flat if we need to get it out of the way too. great price here also. shopped around for this and this price was half of some other places.(and if you are shopping around for dog crates you know how expensive they can be)we couldn't be happier with our choice. and our dog likes it too!
49931,0,"My dog will get a treat out if I stuff it in the gripper, but otherwise ignores it completely. The best use I've found for it is holding ice cubes from the dispenser in the freezer door, the pup likes the cubes and putting them in the gripper makes it a little more interesting. It can also hold Greenies, which our dog then takes out and hides in a corner or buries outside. I wouldn't buy this again."

54366,0,"Although higher priced than many other option, this is a very high quality, sturdy, well-built product. In fact, this is the second one I have purchased from this company because I was so pleased with the first one. I especially like the fact they offer a variety of colors to match any decor in your home. Highly recommended."
153178,1,I have one cat and absolute hate changing the cat litter and the scooping part is even worse. So I figured what the heck let's give this a try. I love it! I hooked it up to the drain for my washing machine so I never see the waste. I also use the manual run cycle because sometimes it would run and there was nothing inside of it. If you have a cat then this is definately worth the money. In about 7 months I've gone through 2 boxes of granules and 3 of the solution. So it's really not that bad. The only negative is that the granules get all over the floor either from the cat getting them on her paws or when it runs the scoop kinda tosses some over the side. I bought the hood for this and that helps somewhat but I still gotta sweep up the floor every couple days. I highly recommend this to everyone!
39999,0,"This is a definite improvement over hand-scooping, and, I think, worth the price. However...the poop sometimes sticks and doesn't fall into the drawer. Moreover, some of the clips holding the top on have broken after only a couple months of owning this, forcing me to awkwardly hold the top down as I rotate the box..."
122396,0,"Good looking, but taller than I expected, and did not fit where I needed to put it. Biggest obstacle was the screw-off top. It would have been a pain to use that because two hands are needed, and I needed a flip top. The opening was also rather small, and my scoop did not fit. I returned it, but anyone who has the space, it is a nice product."
156867,2,"This is not durable enough to leave with our 10lb chihuhua/daschund during the day, as after watching him play with it in the evening he will begin to gnaw on it and break chunks of plastic off! which I then need to take out of his mouth, terrible! This is good for supervised use ONLY."
8646,1,This worked for our black lab. She started getting hot spots on her belly since we moved to Florida. I purchased this after reading the reviews and she seemed to have relief by the next day. I feel like it works better if you rub it in. She actually comes to get her morning spray and likes it!

11781,0,"After reading many of the reviews, I purchased this feeder. I put a battery into it and the light didn't light nor did the feeder spin. I desperately needed a way for the cat to eat when I'm out of town since he gobbles all the food up almost immediately. So, back it went and I ordered a replacement. The replacement arrived, so I put a battery in it and voila, the light lit. It automatically spun so I set it for 6 hours as a test. 6 hours came and went, no spinning. So I reset it and waited another 6 hrs...no spinning. So, back it went and I ordered another replacement. It appears that the third time is the charm. This one works ... spins at the 6th hour so today I will test it with food since I leave in 2-days for a 2 day trip. Fingers crossed it works this time as advertised, and my cat will not starve!"

88836,0,"First, I have to say our cats really enjoyed using this fountain. The large reservoir was really nice; I put ice cubes in it during the summer to keep the water cold. Also, if my wife and I were gone overnight, we could relax knowing there was plenty of water available for our cats. It's not too loud either; you hear the running water stream rather than the electric pump. Speaking about the water pump, that was a major headache. After 6 months it started breaking down. Ordering a replacement from the manufacturer was expensive and surprisingly difficult.Not as difficult as cleaning this machine, though. Since it's constructed of plastic with a very primitive filter system, it's a magnet for bacteria. We should have known something was up when my wife struggled to scrub away the slimy residue that envelopes the entire fountain within days. Disgusting. We used the official cleaning kit and it was still very tedious to get the grime and slime out of every nook and cranny. The cleanliness and quality of the water passing through this fountain became no longer acceptable. We ultimately decided to replace this with a different pet water fountain, one free of plastic, made from ceramic and glass in the USA. Think about it, would you want to dink from the same ""made in China"" plastic cup every day for months or years on end?"
153376,2,"It is strong leather, but the strap and buckle are not very strong. I believe my APBT could break loose from this fairly easy, but it never came to that because the muzzle is a little big and he pulls it right off with a couple paw swipes. I think the paw swipes could probably break the strap though if the muzzle stayed in place. There is no flexibility to the muzzle so if it is not a perfectly snug fit from the start the dog will slip out easily."
62820,2,"We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats. It *was* a 5-star food. But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen. We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine. Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food. We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo. It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have. Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."
190647,2,"After I cracked and ruined my original filter, I purchased a new one that insisted the BioMax inserts were essential to its functionality. Having had my original filter for about 6 years, I decided to follow the instructions about adding BioMax, thinking this was a product upgrade. I was deeply dissapointed. Not only did it create cloudy water, despite my effort to add ""clear water"" drops to resolve this, but the lifespan of my fish decreased dramatically. I was losing fish every week. Once I removed the BioMax insert, the water cleared instantly and my fish started to thrive."
95213,0,"The toy is cute but make sure you check the size. I was so excited about finding a toy that it looked big enough in the picture i never checked size and if your like me and have a bigger dog this is just to small, i can put the whole thing in my hand, my dog would just swallow this whole but for a small dog im sure this would be a great toy."
114801,0,"In the product description, it mentions the sizes offered. At time of checkout, it is not asked which size is desired. When I received the product, it was clearly a small one. It is well made, etc. but was not suitable for my dogs due to the small size."
2149,0,"My goldendoodle has fast growing, tangle-prone hair that I like to keep trimmed short. In an effort to save on grooming expenses, I got this clipper comb along with a high quality Andis clipper and #10 blade. For the most part, the combs didn't work so well on my dog, who has soft, fine, wavy/curly hair that goes in every direction. Except with the shortest combs, I had to make multiple passes to get a cut that looked sort of clean, and it never came out anywhere near as even as his groomer did it. Because it took multiple passes, it took hours of cutting to get my dog looking decent.After seeing what professional groomers use, I've concluded that combs are okay for touching up or for working around the beard, but if you want a clean 3/4 inch cut you should just use an appropriately sized clipper blade--at least on my dog's coat."
203481,1,"I use this on my 80 pd white lab at least once a week. It is the BEST deshedding tool out there - bar none! We purchased the large sized tool and it works great. It doesn't hurt him and he doesn't mind being brushed.Just when you think there is no more hair, there is still more that comes off! But it doesn't make your dog bald, don't be mistakened. It removes the undercoat. Go over a certain spot (the back area by the tail) over and over and it will pick up a lot of hair. Be sure you do this outside because it can be a mess!Absolutely love it and would recommened it to any dog owner!"
69083,0,"The toy was fine for one puppy, but we have two and they were to close to play tug of war very well. Also, fingers are a little too close to the grabbing teeth. But it was OK for the price."
77180,1,"I bought one of these about a year ago, it's a great size for small dogs (I'm a breeder) and then bought three more to use on the porch and the yard for small puppies. I also like the fact that you can easily connect several of them together. I give this product high marks."
62512,0,"Jolly Ball is a great toy for a large breed dog, providing the dog isn't too destructive. I've gotten several of these for my Labrador Retreiver over the last three years and the first one gave him hours of fun until he chewed a big hole in the handle and it became roadkill. Each successive Jolly Ball lasted a little less time than the previous. The last only lasted less than an hour before my boy turned it into roadkill.If Jolly Ball could make a ball with a solid rubber handle, that a labrador could tear apart so quickly, I would happily buy some more. But Jolly Balls are a bit pricey for a toy that doesn't last my dog more than an hour."

56858,0,"I added a decorative wire cord at the top to keep the hood up. My dog just prefers to lie on top, which doesn't provide enough warmth. This size is good for a toy dog, 5 lbs or under. The product is attractive. If your dog is a persistent burrower, he'll figure it out. Mine didn't."

Unfortunately, the claims we have seen DO NOT prove out during actual use. The vendor we purchased from provided a fair price and great service, we certainly do not hold them responsible for the product itself. Probably won't buy this product again."
161068,0,"I first wish to say I find no faults or defects with this cat toy, I just think for a very small or skittish kitten it might not succeed. I have a Singapura kitten, which is a tiny breed, and I think the Bergan Turbo Scratcher is a bit intimidating to him. Loud noises such as the ball makes when it whirls around, jar him and the size of the ball may also be a bit too big and heavy for him until he gets a bit bigger. I still have hope for the toy, though, because he does watch the ball go round when I tap it, so he's not entirely indifferent. Also he is soon to be joined by a Siamese kitten who I think will be much bolder and show him its entertainment value. I will amend my review pending the Siamese ""test"". :)"
198264,0,"I don't know why she won't eat it, she's eaten the other premium brands I've gotten her, and this food's first ingredients are sardines, shrimp, and lobster, stuff I can't even afford to eat on a regular basis! I don't fault the company, I guess you just never know, but now I have to mix this with other food so I won't waste it, or just leave it there until she eats it I guess, but she'll go all day. :( I don't want to give it less than 3 stars though because the ingredients are very healthy. Like the other reviewer, my vet said only wet food for my cat. She ends up with bladder infections and other problems when she eats dry, even just when I've given her dry treats."
55262,0,"I purchased this toy as a gift and decided to test it with my own cats before sending it to the recipient. My cats could not care less about it! If your cats are not highly motivated by food, then this might not be an ideal toy for them.The ball is a brighter, sunnier orange than pictured here, which was a pleasant surprise. The packaging really emphasizes the usefulness of the toy for weight loss, perhaps making it an inappropriate gift. (Hey, I got this for your fat ol' cat!)The instructions came inside the toy itself, which wasn't necessarily ideal. I stupidly thought that it opened along its diameter to be filled, when in reality, there is a small twist-off piece on top. I'm glad I realized my folly before breaking the toy! Once open, the toy was easy to fill and adjust to distribute food."
158007,0,"I have a large icrate with a divider panel. I do love this crate, however the hooks and edges are very sharp. Today I took the divider panel out so I could collapse the crate to give to friend who is watching my puppy while I'm out of town. I leaned the panel against the bedroom door and my puppy came up to investigate. As she backed up, a hook went COMPLETELY THROUGH HER EYELID. After a couple seconds of her screaming in pain I managed to get her calm enough to carefully slide the hook back out and rush her to the vet. Fortunately the hook did not injure her eye but she has a bloody gash in her eyelid and it's very swollen. She's going to have to be on antibiotics for the next week. Vet visit cost $120, half of which was for the emergency status of the visit and the other half for the antibiotics. The hooks need to be rounded off or filed down."
62838,2,"I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc."
45630,0,"When we got a second labrador, the first time I tried to hold both their leashes they pulled me out into the street. I still have scars on my knees. I shouldn't have been surprised - they weigh more than I do, combined (55lbs each - small Labs, really - but I'm a pretty small human). I started dreading a future of taking two walks each time the dogs needed exercise and my husband wasn't around to take one of them.Well, the Gentle Leader meant that future never came. I can walk them by myself, and while sometimes they still pull pretty hard, I've never felt in doubt that I was the one in control. That being said, the dogs hate the Gentle Leader. All the stuff on the package about how the dogs would like it once they're used to it proved utter folly in our case. They shy away when I try to put them on, pout about having them every time they get a chance on the walk, and once I take them off at the end of the walk, they both run over to bed and start scratching their muzzles against the bed. I guess they must really itch? So, I can walk them by myself, which is fantastic - but I do feel terribly guilty putting the dogs in a harness that's so obviously uncomfortable and irritating for them.To me, if you're in a position where the choice is between this product and not walking your dog because you're afraid of being injured, trying the Gentle Leader is a no-brainer. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it, because I'm sure our dogs are not unique in hating how it feels. I only use it when my husband is away - otherwise we use a more traditional harness."
26005,1,"I had already purchased and was using one of these with an elderly cat. I bought two more because the first one holds heat so well (I follow the instructions to the letter - easy enough to do). I wanted our outside dog to have one for cold days and my elderly cat to have options of where to lay! No cords and no overuse of power - I could not be happier and have even recommended this to friends. Granted, they are hard to the touch, but all our pets lay on the deck, floor, dirt...so I figure if I tuck this just underneath a blanket, they are OK - and obviously so as all three seem to stay in use at virtually all times (we have multiple cats - the younger ones like the ""heat"" too)."
132698,1,"I have bought other dog trainers and sent them back after using this one. I now own two of them, helps stop the two little dogs from going crazy when people come to the house. I keep one on one side of the house and the other on the other side. Wish I would have had one years ago."
71774,1,"Our problem was a neighborhood cat was doing it's night time hunting and catching rats, enjoying about half of them and leaving the remains at our front doorstep mat which we would discover in the mornings. Very disgusting to us. Our front courtyard is walled (5-6""), but that didn't stop the delivery of about 5-6 remains over a 3-4 week period. I tried initially with a motion activated light sensor, which seemed to work for about a week, but then new corpses were found. The Cat Stop I purchased 3 weeks ago has worked perfectly so far. I will be happiest after about 2 months of success to be certain our feline friend has found a new doorstep to place his trophies."

We kept it on her and it stays on her pretty good. She's a pretty active dog and our other Jack keeps trying to steal it. Anyway, I recommend it if you can find it for about 15 bucks. It'll stay pretty good if you get the right size. Mags is about 20 lbs and is a parson jack russell terrier. We use the medium for her. Fits pretty good.Good luck"

142453,0,"The idea is fantastic--a litter box that empties itself. The design is well thought-out. The execution of the design is rather questionable. The design seems to have been sent to an offshore plastic molding firm and then shipped to the customer directly with only a little bit of testing. The screws in the rake assembly rust badly from cat urine. The waste tub doesn't easily install and the plastic tub lid doesn't really stay on the lid opener mechanism. The noise is quite loud--our cat took weeks to get used to it. We have used every kind of clumping cat litter and the rake still jams on clumped litter near the ramp on the third day. Removing the waste tub is so clumsy that when I pull the tub upwards, the lip catches on the rim and flings cat litter chunks into my face. Every time.It still beats regular cat litter boxes. We are on our third unit--two have broken after one year of use by one cat but have always been replaced under warranty. The warranty policy is very good. All they want is the battery compartment cover for proof of ownership."
58157,0,"I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy. It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day. Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc. After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest. I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!"

190887,0,"I bought this for my puppy thinking she might grow into the costume (she was about 7 months old and 10 lbs at the time), but it's not very small at all! It fit my brother's 15 lb dachshund a lot better. The material is a bit cheap too, very thin. Overall, it's an okay costume (the hood is pretty cute) but it was not what I was expecting at all. I would buy a size smaller than what is indicated on the specifications listed."
63056,1,the dog loves this toy. She figured out immediately how to get out the balls and loves to bury her nose in the openings. Most toys she destroys but this one she brings again and again to play with.It also appears quite sturdy. I am glad I found a toy she enjoys.

One caution - don't brush hard, keep it light or you might irritate your dogs skin.Works on kitty too - just remember to go lightly - it's easy to overdo on this because it works so well!Dont use on long hair pets - it's way too intense - ask your vet."
131582,1,"This is the best dog toy ever invented. My Shepard puppy went through at least 10 old school frisbee'sShe would just shred the plastic to the point it would not fly. This chuck it lets her burn energy and bite and shakeIt without affecting flight. Speaking of flight, this thing can sail at least as far as a standard fresbeeAn added bonus is that its easier to catch for her in the freezing cold.If you have not tried one of these yet you owe it to yourself to do so."
205868,1,"These are hard to find in Denver, and irreplaceable. One virtue no one has mentioned is that they are entirely oil-free. Which means no stains on your clothes if you pocket a few. Of course, there is enough scent residue to account for what my dog and I refer to as the ""unfortunate pocket eating incident involving the laundry basket and Dad's shirt."""
149227,0,"I have had good luck just taking a shallow pan about the size of an oil pan, or 4qt cook pan, put a little dawn soap in it, add about 2 inches of water, and then suspend a light over it so it shines into the pan. Catches bunches of fleas for practically nothing. I just refill the water once in awhile when it evaporates. Leave the light on day and night, they especially flock to it at night when it's the only light on. It really works!"
190625,2,"Buyer beware! I was looking for a replacement of my Doskocil litter scooper and this seemed to look the same on the website... what a disappointment when I got it!My old Doskocil is the only litter scooper on the market that I know of that actually filters scoopable litter effectively because it has a 3/16 inch ridge at the lowest point of the pan, right where the smallest solid pieces of the sifted litter collect. Ideally this ridge would be even twice as wide. The scooper I received does have a narrow solid part but on a slope, not the lowest part of the pan... so, it is of no use whatsoever to sift out the small solid parts (the most difficult to get out). Does anybody know of any scooper that is like my old Doskocil, i.e. that has an angle and a ridge across the pan? gabimaus@pacbell.net"

39470,2,"I purchased this box a month ago and have found that when it stays together it works exactly as described - which would be a five star rating - however, as mentioned by another customer the tabs which hold the lid on and the sifting tray inside do not work properly. This means I roll it and the lid pops off; spilling litter everywhere...or the sifting tray slides around and more than just waste clumps end up in the pull-out drawer. To say this box has *increased* my time piddling around with the litter is an understatement. After purchase of this box I have spent more time sweeping up piles of used litter off the floor and around the box and reaching in and scooping what it improperly sifted. If this box were manufactured to stay together with ease then it would be fantastic. Unfortunately you risk getting a box that is poorly designed and could cause you to dump litter everywhere. I will be returning if possible and hope another box will be better."
110772,0,"If the makers of this cube would make it out of a material that does not break so easily, I would buy another one in a heartbeat. I am debating it still. This was our border collier/blue heeler mixes' favorite toy for months. She whacked it around so much, our dining room sounded like a hockey tournament played with bricks was taking place. It entertained her for long periods of time, which is a major miracle when you have such a smart, active dog. Unfortunately, as others have said, the center piece came out, and I worried that she could hurt herself with the unprotected edge of the hole. I don't know, maybe I will get it again, and if it happens a second time, I'll just duct tape it or something. She really did love this toy, even more than her Kong Wobbler or the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball I got her. Just something about the cube. So, it might be a toy worth trying for a smart dog, but it is not indestructible. Marcy was hard on it, I fully admit, but, then, that is the nature of puppies. Buy it only if you will supervise play time. This is not a toy I would recommend an owner just leave with their dog while they are gone. TheOmega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, Largeis a better choice for unsupervised play (though the warning on all dog toys says to supervise....like we have that much time in our day!!). And, I would add, you might think of choosing toward the large size if you don't know if a medium or large is the right choice for your dog. I found that Marcy plays more with the larger sizes since they both hold more food and require more work on her part to maneuver. She seems to like to use both her mouth and paws."
211794,1,"I absolutely love this brand. They will replace their product, with no questions asked, for free. When your dog scratches his collar and gets it all fuzzy, they will replace it. Amazing. Love this brand."
211820,1,"Happy with this product. After plumbing through 6-8 feet of hose, running through a fairly restrictive custom filter, and pushing water 4 feet up to my aquarium, the pump is still putting out a little over 200gph at the outlet.The item also comes with a lot of extra adapters and things which were not listed in the packaging, all the better though since it saved me some money buying additional parts. Seems to be a well built item.Now for the longevity test."
23729,0,"Pros: I originally ordered this feeder because of its larger capacity than the traditional, single tube feeder. It took about two weeks for my little feathered friends to get familiar with the new feeder, so you have to be patient. I discovered that if the perches on the feeder are placed in their fully-opened position, small and medium sized birds (Juncos and Redwing Blackbirds, in my area) really enjoy this this feeder. Cons: 1-If you attempt to adjust the perches, smaller, to exclude medium-sized birds, I found that the perches will not stay in position. Any larger bird, unsuccessfully, attempting to land will push the perches into the feeder, thus preventing even small birds from landing. It's too bad, that the feeder wasn 't designed to lock the perches in position, as does, when fully-opened. 2-Because of the angle of the feeder openings, even small birds are able to empty these feeders much more quickly, than the traditional single tube feeder. The result, is that you have a lot more seed on the ground than in the feeder, in a very short time."
42618,1,"Our betta started getting a fuzzy coating on her so I put her in a small hospital tank (about a quart size) and treated her with these drops in the small confine. It says to add the dosage of drops daily and then make a water change after 7 days of treatment. I think the gradual build up of this is how it safely helps. After 3 days in the hospital tank, we could see a cottony coating coming off our beta. It looked like she was molting. She was more active and her appetite returned and she got a brighter hue. This stuff really does the trick for minor issues. I recommend it, if you know it's a topical issue like ich or velvet."
31476,0,"This product works in the immediate area where it is deployed. I have yet to have a cat spray an area within a few feet of a diffuser. Unfortunately they are spraying other places nearby, and unless I buy one of these diffusers for every outlet in the house we may be out luck. Of note is that the primary cat causing all of the problems is possibly the most neurotic cat I have ever seen, and I have had the ""pleasure"" of living with quite a few over the years. So if your cat is a little more normal this product might resolve your issues."
191750,0,"We have three Guinea pigs. We've had them since February of this year, so we're still working through products to find which suit us best. Up until about two weeks ago, we had been using this bedding in our C&C (Cubes and Coroplast)cage. While this stuff is great as far as absorbency goes, it really leaves something to be desired in the way of odor control. Also, when the piggles go on a ""popcorning"" frenzy around the cage, they end up kicking alot of it out and it blocks my vacuum up in no time. Because of the in-store prices in my area (sky high, around $20 for a decent sized bag!), two weeks ago, we switched to a fleece bedding system and today, I switched back to the Carefresh. This time, however, I bought the Carefresh Basic and the Kaytee Soft Sorb in Mint. The wood shavings in the Basic are meant to be safe for Cavies and the mint leaves in the Soft Sorb are really freshening the living room up. As I have two sows and a neutered boar, I plan on trying the pink rose blend as well of the soft-sorb (I'm sure Puddle is secure enough with his manly-ness to live in pink bedding). If you ask me, the Carefresh Natural just isn't worth the price, unless you like the smell of Cavie pee."
49974,0,House was as description said only trouble was the door swings up and not down when you open the door. This creates a problem when the eggs are in the house and when babies hatch out because when the door swings out and up the top of the goes door goes into the house and unless you watch closely could hit the eggs or babies. I changed the door so the opens down now the bottom of the door when it swings in only touches the bottom of the nest. This is a very good house birds used it the first year. I would buy it again

71758,2,"For years now I've been trying to find a better way to keep cats from peeing and spraying in front of my door. A wash of lemon-scented suds slows them down for about a week, depending on the weather, but it's messy and it's a bother.Which is why I was so excited to find CatStop. According to the directions, I could set the gizmo and be done with it! It seemed logical, even magical, that a zap of ultra-sound should do the trick. When it came in the mail, I was like a kid at Christmas. I gave it a brand new battery and tested it with a wave of my hand. Perfect! Then I stuck it in the grass and sat down to wait for a cat to set it off.It didn't take long. The calico next door crossed its beam, it chirped and I expected to see her jump and run. Instead she set out to investigate. It took her about five stops and starts to get to the box, flinching every time it chirped, but she kept on coming. When she touched it with her nose, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.But I consoled myself with the thought that maybe female cats are by nature more curious. And since the cats peeing and spraying were most likely male, there was still a chance it could work. The next day I moved the magic box to another spot in the grass and hunkered down to wait for a visit from one of the half-dozen or so Toms that roam the backyard.Again, it didn't take long. The box chirped, the cat stopped in his tracks, ears back. He seemed positively irritated by the sound--a good sign! But like the calico, he couldn't resist checking out the box that was making the noise. He started again, the box went off, he stopped. He started, the box went off, he stopped. And so it went, until he touched the thing with his nose. At which point I went inside to find out how to get my money back.Now I don't want to say that Contech is exaggerating or that you'd be a fool to try the thing for yourself. Maybe the cats in my neighborhood are just too mellow or too savvy to be unhinged by this chirp-in-a-box. But as for me, I'm back to using the lemon-scented Lysol to keep the critters off my porch. It's a bother but at least it works."
207344,2,"My daughter needed this item for an event and the wrong item was delivered. By then we were under a time crunch so I talked to customer service but there was no way Target would expedite shipping the correct item to arrive in time. I had to order the item from another supplier and pay for 2 day delivery.In the meantime, the online pathway for getting a shipping label to return the wrong item lets me spend time putting all the information in but then shuttles me to a ""Try again"" screen. I try half a dozen or more times and give up. An hour later I try again with the same dead end. I email customer service to just send a label by email but have yet to receive a response. The next day I try again with the same dead end. I have wasted a lot of time for something I don't even want. I think I will let my credit card company know to not pay, and let the supplier ship me a return label when they get around to it.Can you tell I am not impressed with the 'service'?"
169524,1,"Within seconds of giving this toy to my cat he literally started drooling, and then proceeded to attack it with a delightful vengeance. As others have noted, this toy is not very durable, after continuously being bitten by your cat it probably won't last a week or so; however, it only costs $5.55 and your cat will LOVE it."
30543,2,"I bought this product to use for vacation as well, but beware, if you are going to use it with flaked food. First, you must grind the flakes smaller to even get through the feeder.

176623,0,"I live in Baton Rouge, LA and our summers are ideal for producing flea infestations i.e. hot humid weather from May until October. I read good reviews for this yard flea insecticide and decided to give it a try. It was recommended by veterinarians and unlike most yard sprays it contains an IGR (insect growth regulator) that keeps the eggs and larvae from developing into fleas. I do not have a bad flea infestation because I use Advantage II on my little dog every 2 - 4 weeks as needed. He still gets a flea or two every month so I like to treat my yard as well. I used this product as directed and within a few days my dog had another flea. My guess is there is not enough of the IGR in the product. I used the product again and got the same result so I am back to using the Ortho Bug-B-Gone yard spray (that does not contain an IGR) and just spray every week or every other week. The Ortho costs much less and for me it works better, I just have to spray often because it only kills developed fleas and not the eggs and larvae. Hopefully it won't kill us as well."
108227,1,I use this daily when working with my lab pup. She is ready to go outside and perform knowing there is a treat waiting on her. It is very handy and love the way it fits around my waist leaving my hands free to work and sign with her. Made very well.

This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix, and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated.

135574,0,"I purchased my first Birdscapes Hummingbird feeder about 8 months ago, due to the design. It looks classic, and high-quality, compared to the other cheap plastic looking ones. After about 5 months, I noticed that the flowers faded from the sun and cracked and rusted, and the small metal rings on the inside of the flowers have severely rusted. My hummingbird feeder lives under a slatted porch roof so is partially protected from the elements. The rest of the feeder still looks great, but the birds have stopped coming :( The birds are clearly requesting a new feeder. I just order another one, because design is the most important thing, and I just couldn't bare to look at a cheap piece of neon red plastic hanging outside my living room window. I hope the company figures out that the parts are rusting and take care of the problem. I am disappointing that I have to buy another product due to their inability to make a product that lasts."
169879,0,I ordered this to hold a 30lb bag of dog food. It does not hold the entire bag like it states it will. I really needed the larger model. I wish it would have shown me all the sizes available when I ordered. Other than that it is exactally as pictured and made very well. works great. Delivery took a little while but overall I am happy.

114366,2,"The collar was way too big for a miniature schnauzer. We did trim it following the directions and used it. When it worked it did make him stop barking but it had to be fussed with often. Refilling, retightening etc. It made him very wary and nervous when it worked. He learned quickly when it was on or off. Once he barked when my grandaughter was sitting by him and they both got sprayed no ill effects for either but a lot of complaining. It worked approximately 3 days. The 4 flashes light came on and won't go off. This indicates no fill. But even though I fill it ???? It won't work anymore. So I don't recommend this particular collar. It's way too much $$$ for 3 days of silence."

I got this bulb in, along with the 10k bulb from the same seller to replace the two bulbs that have blown on my minitank. The 10k is good. The actinic bulb arrived in the manufacturer box, but without the cardboard insert for protection. That wasn't a problem, bulb still works and Amazon packaged it great. Upon power-on, the bulbs had the exact same color! First thought was that there was a mixup, but the bulb said actinic too! Not sure what to do with this bulb now, so two stars because it works, but only two because the phosphor is obviously not actinic."

83339,0,I have purchased two different sizes of Midwest wire crates in the past few months for a growing puppy. In both cases the cages are bent or crooked on one side so they have a cockeyed area down one side that should be secured by clips. I am going ahead and using the crates but the situation seems to be a fault in manufacture and or shipping as the larger crate was visibly bent by the metal latches. The doors do not open readily and there is a struggle to latch the gates on both side of the crate! On the smaller model the whole side fell in on my puppy a week or two ago! Luckily she was not injured but it is a problem! Again I will repair the faulty side by purchasing clips but one should look elsewhere if you want a better made crate!Price was the deciding factor on this purchase!
103402,2,"I had high hopes for this collar. It's working fine, I can feel the stimulation when I tried it on myself, and the automatic beep tones are telling me that it fits ME just fine. But I can't get it to fit on our dog properly at all. I must have tried 100 times and only once did it indicate that it had proper connection. She never received any stimulation from it at all. And it's not like she's an odd breed with a weird shaped neck! She's a shepherd mix. I think that in their attempt to streamline the device it somehow made it more limited as to the size and shape of the dog's neck where it will fit properly. I even called the company and the representative was very helpful, many suggestions - none of which worked. I thinned out the hair on her neck too. So it's going back to MuttMart, the Amazon affiliate that sold it to me. I'll leave feedback on them when I see that the return is processed and I'm refunded. I'm off to buy a different model from a local store so that I can return it more easily if it also fails to work with my dog."
15816,0,"The product works by applying an uncomfortable electrical charge. The small puck batteries in the collar drain very rapidly, and the mechanism on the collar is made of cheap semi hard plastic material that is NOT water resistant. As a result, I cannot leave the collar on my 80lb dog all the time. It does let the dog know what behavior is unacceptable, but my dog is smart enough to realize she does NOT have to be on her best behavior when the collar is off her neck."
198508,2,"Miss leading information provided. It is not ""bags"" but just one 10 ounce bag. The MSRP of $129+ makes you think that there would be multiple bags of at least 10. I returned and got a prompt refund. It is a great product, but my local pet store sells them for under $20 a bag."
73373,2,"This seemed great, but my cat absolutely would not go in this thing. It's really big and he was so frightened that I left his old litter box next to it so he'd know where to go and so he'd go. As a result, he never tried it. Since this was the case, I removed the old litter box and he relieved himself on a little Elmo couch we have and in a duffle bag (which was good because we could just throw them away). Anyway, we ended up having to return the Litter Robot and give him his old litter box back. He won this battle."
114338,0,"The product is a bit flimsy - the inserts aren't really a good fit and seem to move around, but that doesn't bother the cat any. There are little containers to put catnip in (included) but you only need the tiniest amount - in fact, my cat was all over it without adding any because the scent was on it from shipping.You will definitely need to buy different sticky strips -- I used the ones included and it fell off immediately. I purchased the 3M Command small poster strips and used four - works great. You can get a pack of 16 for a few bucks and they should remove easily without marking your walls. I might buy a bunch more Kitty Korner Kombers for other places (as if I could get my cat to rub against only one corner?)"
197799,2,"They were out of Tidy Cats at the grocery store I shop at, so I picked up a 14 pound jug of this stuff, figuring that all the lower-priced scoopable cat litter brands were about the same. I was wrong.This litter puts out a lot of dust, and the ammonia smell was so bad that I went through the entire jug almost twice as fast as I do the Tidy Cats. It also does not clump as well as the Tidy Cats, which probably explains why cat urine odors are so free to travel.I do not recommend this product."
125477,0,"As soon as I opened the box this was my 13 month 75lb lab's favorite toy! She isn't really a big chewer by any means but she has a habit of putting paws on things and pulling on them and she eventually did manage to tear the tail off in under two weeks. I'm not totally surprised she did that with the way she would play with it and try to ""kill"" it. So as far as purchases go I am not unhappy since it did give her a lot of enjoyment but I do sort of wish it was more durable so she could of used it longer. I might even get her another one at some point but for now she is working on the AKC rabbit toy so I will wait till she either gets bored with that one or destroys it!UPDATEBought a second one because she loved the first one so much. Lasted about as long as the first before she ripped it open and started removing all the filling. So this is a great toy for my dog if you assume it will last maybe two weeks. However I should say that after taking all the stuffing out she does still like to play with it even though it loses all its shape but I keep an eye on it because the tail seems like it sheds fur all over the floor which thankfully she doesnt want to eat just chew on."
124634,0,Smooth transaction. Shipping was prompt. I use Advantage every year and it works great. The only problem I have with this order is: I don't see an expiration date anywhere on the box nor on the tubes. This makes me wonder how old the product is. I'm sure the Expiration date is somewhere among the numbers but I have no clue where to find the date. I just applied the product 2 days ago. We shall see.
9745,2,"I was very disappointed to find that the picture listed for the Vetri-Science Glyco-Flex State II Joint Support Formula Soft Chews for Dogs was deceptive. The picture shown holds 180 soft chews. The package I paid for and received, which is a small pouch, contained 60 chews. I tried multiple times, both by phone and e-mail, to contact the seller and received no response. Had I known that I had purchased 60 chews and not 180, I never would have made this purchase."
22965,0,"Perhaps I got the wrong size for my 11 year-old Siamese cat. It does remove more fur than the regular brush, but not the quantity shown in the video.

56790,2,Got this bed for my little minpin who loves to burrow. Was great at first but within a months time was lumpy and uneven and substantially less fluffy. I would say that there was not enough fill in this bed and what was there was of poor quality. Bought a new bed a costco that is holding up great!
169910,0,It's a decent price. It's a little thin on the stuffing. Seems to be better when both dogs are on it instead of one. I like the fact you can toss the whole thing in the wash. That makes it much easier to tolerate.
127842,0,"I got this for my westie mix. HE LOVES IT (a little too much). He likes chewing on the toys and pulls the stuffing out. He started this behavior about 3 weeeks after I got it. Overall it's a good product, but I wish the squirrels were more durable.ps. Putting food inside really keeps him interested."
109098,0,"The main issue I had with this purchase is the time it took to be delivered. The seller had already charged me for the purchase and it showed having been sent, however when I tried to track the package a few days later, it showed it had only been initialized, not actually dropped off or picked up by USPS yet. So it took about a week longer than originally quoted to arrive. I even had to email the buyer to ask them about the status of the purchase at one point, but it eventually arrived and I've been generally satisfied with it since. The battery dies fairly quickly on the remote.. after only a few uses. I've learned to remove the battery if I know I won't be walking her the next day. Otherwise, works well and I'm glad you can lower the settings so much."

137453,0,"Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys.A long time fan of Kong products - because they usually design toys with the dog in mind and not humans .A rarity among dog toys that beg for our attention with an army of adorable kitty cats, bunnies and an endless parade of cute toys.With the majority of them resembling road kill in a very short time.That said, we had a feeling this particular toy being ""soft"" as opposed to the hard yet pliable Kong material would be destined for a very short life. It held up longer than most. However despite expected small tears, this toy was headed for garbage pail.Kong makes some great toys for hard core chewers unfortunately, this isn't one of them. Our dogs (both bulldogs) adored them but they really aren't built to take the torture agressive chewers dish out - and Kong shouldn't market these as such. It's a disservice to their loyal and new customers alike."

90451,1,"The dog boots keep my dogs paws clean and dry in snow and rain. Saves alot of time, since you don't have to dig snow and ice out of paw pads. It took a day for my dog to get used to the boots. Try putting one boot on front paw and one boot on back paw to allow your dog to get used to boots. Once my dog connected wearing boots meant going outside to play in snow...she loved getting boots put on paws. Now she brings me her boots when she wants to go outside. I recomment the Guardian Gear Dog Boots. Make sure you buy the right size...a little bigger is better than too tight."
113979,0,"I bought two of these, one for each dog, and they love them.judging by the way they chew on them. they are nice beds and I would have giving 5 stars but the size on both was off by several inches and I ordered then to fit their crates and that a sizable gap around the crates so GO BIG, order a sze up."
14950,0,"This is a good buy for someone purchasing their first bird feeder. The pole which is enclosed is rather flimsy and not that tall, so for security you really need to replace it. By all means, purchase a squirrel guard, because if squirrels get up on the feeder, which they will, they not only eat all the seed but they also severely gouge the bottom tray and seed falls out more easily. If you're really serious about a bird feeder, then I would try one that is sturdier."

24985,1,"These fake plants look better than most you can find at pet stores for twice the money. My only complaint with them is that they have the same problems as many fake aquarium plants. The stems of the plants tend to detach a bit too easily when putting them in your tank, so often when cleaning the tank, a stalk will come floating to the surface and has to be re-attached.That complaint I have had with most of the many fake plants I have purchased, no matter how much I have spent, so I wouldn't say this is a bad product, especially for the price range."
143683,1,"I have a 55 gallon tank that came with an OEM filter. After watching the ammonia levels in my tank continuing to go up and up after about one week of ownership I decided to search Amazon for a better filter. This filter is by far the coolest thing ever! The tank water is actually filtered through like three layers of filtering agents and apparently the cleaning is very easy and hassle free although I haven't actually done that yet.The filter is aesthetically amazing, it is clear and you can see the water flowing up and through the filter. The best part of all is that my ammonia levels and PH dropped to the PERFECT levels.Very rarely do I feel like I should have paid more for a purchase but in this case I don't think you could pay enough for this filter. Excellent product, excellent value, and I can already tell my fish are notably more active."

38158,0,"we have 5 cats, 2 Litter Robots, and 1 Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box. we bought the Omega Paw box when we bought a house and found that with the increased square-footage, we needed more than just the 2 robots to cover the area.we got this box because once we understood how it worked, we immediately recognized it as, essentially, a manual version of the Litter Robot, which we *love*. to clean it, you roll the box to the right. everything in the ""potty"" part shifts to the right. good litter sifts through the grill, clumps and poop don't. as you keep rolling, the clumps fall onto what ordinarily would be the ""side"" of the litter box, above the waste drawer. shift the box back into it's original position, remove the waste drawer, dump out the clumps, and ta-da! much easier than scooping, and definitely easier than other ""sifting"" boxes i've used that involved 2 solid trays, a sifting tray, and a whole lot of dumping and shuffling.it can be tricky to use in tight spaces but can be done. it's just a matter of gradually moving the whole thing to the left as you roll it to the right.some other problems, however, aren't as easy to work around.for one thing, clumps end up forming in the area where the ""good"" litter goes during cleaning. i've found this impossible to avoid. this is because the sifting grill comes all the way down to the floor of the litter box and there's nothing to keep the litter from getting up against the grill. sure, *you* can tilt the box so that most of the litter is away from the grill after cleaning, but cats dig and kick, and before long, there's litter up against the grill. and if a cat urinates in the litter close enough to the grill, the clump that forms can form around the grill, leaving part of the clump inside of that ""good litter reservoir"". getting into that area to remove the clumps involves completely disassembling the litter box. how often you have to do this will depend on how often your cat urinates near the grill.also, for some reason, the end of the long, skinny waste drawer doesn't come flush with the back of the litter box. instead, the back of the drawer is angled, leaving a gap underneath it, and for the life of me, i can't imagine why they would have made it this way! occasionally, when i roll the litter box to clean it, a clump will manage to end up in that gap, above the ""good litter reservoir"" and below the waste drawer where it is angled at the end. from there, one option is to roll the box hard to the left to get the clump out of the gap and then roll it right again and hope it doesn't happen again. otherwise, you end up having to scoop it out or remove it some other way. but usually i don't notice it until i'm rolling the box back to the left, and it suddenly plops out into the clean litter.and then there is the ""litter leakage"" issue during cleaning. assembled, there are 4 pieces to this litter box. one is the waste drawer. there's the ""hood"" piece, then there's the bottom piece. the ""good litter reservoir"" is formed by a 4th, L-shaped piece that has a grill on one side so the litter can pass through and is solid on the other side. the ""grill"" side stands perpendicular to the bottom, and the solid part is secured by being sandwiched between the ""hood"" and the bottom piece at the edges. perhaps some kind of rubber seal piece might help, but i find that when rolling the litter box, a small amount of good litter escapes from the right side of the box.these problems could be fixed with fairly simple changes to the design. most of the time it's easier than scooping out a ""regular"" litter box, but it certainly is not without its flaws."

30920,0,"The product works great, however, I originally ordered 4 of them to put on my cars to keep the cats off, but, received 2 of them along with 2 hand held zappers that the outside box was labled incorrectly. Their inventory thought that they were shipping me 4 of the tattle tales, but, due to the box mislabling, I only got 2 of them and 2 of these Zappers. But there is another ""however""... However, after using the 2 mislabled hand held zappers, I found that I can use these in both of my garages to instantly make all cats and unwanted little animals scurry vigorously out of my garage so, I can lock it up. In the past, it was a nightmare trying to get the cats out. By the time I got one cat out, another came in. Now I point, shoot, and they scatter... So, even though I didn't get exactly what I ordered, I decided to keep the zappers. Both products have worked very well for me........ and I don't have kitty poop in my garage any more from the hiding cat that got locked in!!"

154466,1,"My husband and I are so glad we bought this litter box. Our apartment smells better, the cats don't drag clay litter all over the floor anymore, and best of all, my husband has more time with me since he isn't constantly scooping and scrubbing the litter box anymore. I would recommend this litter box to anyone with cats or even small, litter-trained dogs. It is well worth its price in gold!9/27/07Just wanted to add an update. We got a chihuahua a few months ago and have already trained her to use this litter box. She loves it and it's such a lifesaver in this Florida heat!1/07/08Update: After less than a year of use, the ScoopFree no longer works. It starts running when the cats get in the box and half the time it won't scoop their poop anymore. We stopped using it and went back to scooping litter. I'm disappointed this didn't last longer, especially considering the amount of money we put into the unit and the refill trays. Amazon wouldn't let me change my rating, but now I'd give it 2 stars or less."
45415,1,"I was reccomended this product by a dog training friend of mine. I have two dogs who both pull on the leash when we go on walks and trying to break them of the pulling habbit has not been easy. Yes, they had a problem at first as both of them tried to get it off, pulling at it with their paws. But, after a few minutes on the walk they stopped trying to get it off and were walking much better. It took months of walking with them on their gentle leaders but they really are better now. Definatley not perfect walkers but I will take what I can get, I didnt expect this thing to work miracles but for the amount of training that I do (somewhat minimal) this really helped."
94470,2,"After reading another review regarding the manufacture of this Product in India, before I placed my order I called Virbac in Fort Worth, Texas and spoke to a sales representative. I asked about the product being manufactured in India, and she assured me that it was not. Said that had been considered, but it never happened and the item was manufactured in the US.I clearly stated, ""So, if I purchase this product, when it arrives, I will receive a product manufactured in the United States?"" She said oh yes. Please be aware this was not an Amazon contact, this was direct by phone to Virbac in Texas.WRONG. Item received today and right on the label it says MADE IN INDIA in all caps. I immediately went online and returned the product for a refund; with no problem from Amazon.Since there is apparently no way to know where this product was manufactured until it arrives in your hand; I discourage purchase. Perhaps we should check at local retailers for label information. Pet Tabs have been a good product for years. I am sorry to see this decline in manufacturing QA of a consumable product. I intend to call Virbac back tomorrow and express my disappointment."

However, as much as he loved it, once he got past about 8 months old, I had to take it away from him, because he started ripping it to shreds; therefore, it wasn't safe for him to play with.As far as fun for the dog goes, I would rate it a 5; however, when it comes to durability it only gets a 3. I would not recommend this toy for a dog that rips stuffed animals apart, because it will be history before the hour is up.Perhaps, when my dog gets older, as he is now 14 months old, and when/IF he stops that phase of tearing it to shreds, I would definitely buy it again."

173295,0,"It's a little big and bulky and not as inconspicuous as one would like. The plastic plant on top is a lot cheaper looking than the one in the photo. We actually replaced ours. We have a disabled cat who has trouble getting into it, but for most cats, it's not a problem."
85883,1,"This pooch coat is just terrific. Not only does our little Doxypoo look adorable in it, but it protects her from cold weather and is made of quality materials.

Kiki (the cat) likes her little box more without the bags. Still a great product. I don't like the sides of it at the bottom, it makes it diffcult to clean because of the folding. It is just OK."
47712,2,"Been feeding my dog this for 2 months; it caused drooling and vomiting. Had blood analysis and xrays done, it was this food. I never thought this ""high quality"" dog food would have been responsible, it was. There have been multiple recalls, yet it still remains on the shelves."
166510,0,"I honestly can't say how this would work under the right conditions. It might be a great product, but it wasn't made for the cats in my house.First of all, it says to add 1tsp to your cat's bowl of water every morning. This is too vague. We use a water dispenser at my house and there's no Good Cat to Water ratio anywhere on the bottle. Nothing stating one tsp to 2 cups or anything like that. I guessed when adding it, and I don't have any idea if I put in too much or too little.The second problem we had with this isn't a issue with the actual product at all. It's only that the cats at our house seem to prefer drinking out of the toilet, and we kept forgetting to leave the lid down. Because of this they weren't really drinking much of the water.We ended up getting one of the diffusers. They're expensive so we got only one and put it in the room our cats use most. We also unplug it whenever none of them are there. It hasn't been any sort of miracle fix, but I can see a difference.We also kicked out the female who seemed to be planning a hostile takeover, and now she's happily taking over our carport. She'll be back in when the weather turns, (a month to six weeks) and hopefully things will have calmed down between her sons and our original cats.I'm putting this extra stuff in because a lot of the reviews on the diffusers said ""this sucks"" or ""this is awesome"" but didn't put anything about the cats situation so I had no idea if it would help me."
140174,2,"We tried this with our new puppy and gave it a good month of effort. We even discussed it with our dog trainer thinking we were doing something wrong.

29382,1,"Nupro addresses joint and skin issues from the inside out. It's a wonderful supplement we use regularly, along with Solid Gold's Sea Meal. It helps keep our dogs looking their best, for the many shows and events we attend. Their coats are shiny and healthier, which is the main reason we use it. My dogs are picky eaters. They will not readily take a powdered supplement, but I have found that Nupro is different. It is liver-flavored, and that makes a HUGE difference, at least from the dog's standpoint. My dogs don't like this in a wet or gravy form, so I have found that by adding just enough water (one or two tbsps), and stirring well, the powder will coat and stick to their kibble. When I do this, they readily gobble it down. Note: most dogs seem to really like the taste, but there are a few that may not like it or be put off from the garlic smell. Our neighbor's dog doesn't seem to care for it. If that's the case, I recommend Solid Gold's Sea Meal, which is another great supplement, and perhaps an alternative."
40351,1,We purchased one of these quite awhile back and LOVE it. Our big fluffy kitty (don't hurt his feelings by saying fat) is very particular about his litter being just right. We tried automatic boxes which he hated and showed his distress by using the floor instead. Bought this and no problems since. It's so easy to clean even our teenagers will do it when asked!
103586,1,"I'll never understand why cats enjoy sleeping in spaces that appear too small for them, but they do. Or at least mine do.

131301,1,"A few months ago I adopted a 9 month old border collie/lab mix who has endless energy. Fortunately she loves to play fetch so we can TRY to wear her out with this activity. The problem was that within a few weeks of adopting her, my throwing arm ached like crazy. I didn't know launchers even existed when I turned to the internet to solve my problem, but my husband is an engineer so I decided if I couldn't find something, I would ask him to design one. Well, it didn't take long to find the Chuck-It and I ordered two of them - the long one and the mini.Side note: my 13YO son was unaccountably excited when he heard I'd ordered a ball launcher and surprisingly disappointed when it arrived. It turns out, he had visions of rocket launchers and had envisioned a machine that would launch the ball out of sight and couldn't wait to see it in action. His disappointment was in its simplicity and the fact it would require actual manual effort on our part to get it to work. LOL.I, however, am NOT disappointed. I use the mini most of the time and love how far I can throw the ball without my arm aching at all. It was so easy to learn to use and with a little practice I am accurate enough to hit a tree (if I want to) with it so the ball goes exactly where I want it to, every time. My dog LOVES the launcher. She starts dancing in circles as soon as she sees me pick it up.One of the best features of the launcher is that I no longer have to handle a soggy ball. When she drops the ball at my feet, all I do is scoop it back up in the launcher and throw it again. At the end of the session, I scoop it up and it lives in the launcher until the next session. This is such an incredible bonus they should charge extra for it.My husband is better with the long one. I find it harder to get the ball to release in time so it doesn't go as far for me as with the mini. I know its just a learning curve and I need to learn to flick my wrist back slightly to release it at the best time, but I'll confess I haven't taken the time to practice this. Also, the large one, having so much longer a handle tends to flex when I try to pick up the ball so its actually harder to do this. I would like to try the in-between size to see if I can throw the ball further than with the mini but still pick the ball up easily."
216088,0,"This is really a nice looking cat tree. The sheepskin- like fabric is nice and cozy. I like it better than carpet or fleece. I bought this for my adult cats to use. They are 17 pounds, 14 pounds and 12 pounds. There is no way any of these guys would fit in that little bed. And the platforms are really not big enought either. I also take care of foster kittens for the local shelter, this is perfect for them. I have two fosters right now and they absolutely love this tree. The toys are fun, the ladder is being used and the bed is always full of one or both kittens. So just consider the size of your cat before buying this. Kittens and smaller cats would be fine, but big cats not so much.So on to my search for one for the big guys. Finding a bigger sturdy tree that doesn't break the bank is a challenge."

There are no wires to provide the shock and it is missing the charge pack that would provide the shock if the wires were actually in the mat.Stay away from this seller. They do not deserve your business.
53910,0,"I have been feeding this to my 4 lb. fish for years in this bulk package. Looks like they reduced the size of the wafers to about 1/4 of what they used to be which is not to my liking. Where I used to feed Fishy exactly 20 wafers, now I am not going to count out 80 mini wafers. I also believe some of these mini wafers get lost in the rocks and are uneaten."
16694,0,"Well, the item was as expected and displayed, but my dog didn't really seem to care whether or not she was getting sprayed in the faceand continued to bark. I used it for about a week and then took it off of her. I'm sure it would work for a dog not so stubborn."

172563,1,"I bought this for my 7 month old miniature dachshund puppy. I ordered a size small. It is long enough to cover most of her back, but mu pup is very lean and the velcro ties around the chest and belly were too loose on her. I bought extra velcro and sewed it on myself so I could secure the coat more tightly. Other than that, my dog loves her coat, and this is a dog who does not like to dress up! It keeps her warm and looks great. I love that it does not pull over her head but just velcro around her upper chest, by the collar, and her belly."

After the addition of the UV sterilizer my tank has been crystal clear, however the skimmer has not produced any scum."

74506,1,I received my gate on time right before Christmas and I love it. I own two pitbulls (80 lbs each) and now I am able to keep them out of my living area. It was wide enough and the installation was minimal. The dogs cannot jump the gate or push it down like other gates I've purchased before. I would recommend it to anyone.

137947,1,"I really like this crate. I had a solid, airline-ready crate previously, but changing circumstances necessitated something collapsible. This one fits the bill perfectly.It's easy to setup and take down, the screens provide plenty of ventilation (and view, for the creature), it's light enough to scoot around the carpet for vacuuming and, most importantly, my dog likes it.I save five stars for when I'm really wowed by a product, which is hard for a dog crate to do, but the four stars is by no means due to any fault with the crate. If you're in the market for a solid frame, collapsible dog crate, seriously consider this one.(Thankfully my dog's not much of a chewer, so I haven't had to worry about that aspect; which also means I can't speak to its suitability for teething puppies or avid chewers.)"

120324,0,I have been using these whisper hang on back filters for over ten years because they just work.The flaws are some are noisy right out of the box and some become noisy after a few years .This has always been due to a bad or worn out impeller in my experience. They only cost $10-$15For a new impeller but $15 is what this filter costs new. I don't see why they are more than $5 its a magnet a stainless steel rod a piece of plastic and two rubber ends. Costs pennies to make.My other criticisim is the filter cartridges are too expensive and can be a bit of a mess.Over all it is a good filter the only downfall is the cost to maintain it.
130765,0,"This is a great quality product, and my snakes really do enjoy it. It's somewhat easy to clean, and looks great in my display cages designed with the snakes in mind. The issue that I have is that neither of the two pieces included fit worth a darn!! There is a sizable overlap of about 1/4""-1/2"" along the long edge. With some finagling, I was able to get it to look decent enough without causing my snakes any hinderance. Be far warned though, it's some what annoying!!"

29910,0,"The Positive: The dog loves the sound these make...although your neighbors will not. It's loud, high pitched, and sounds like it's dying. Good for the dog though.The Negative: Every creature in the lineup has some sort of rubber piece that the dog will snap off within 30 minutes. The elephant has a trunk; the dragon has a tongue; the octopus has tentacles, etc.Trust me: These do not last long if your dog is moderately curious (40 pound Basenji mix here). But...they are fun while they last :)"

111313,0,"We purchased this litter for our two cats and have had a very different experience with the litter depending on the cat. I would say that the biggest downside to this litter is the very fine dust that it gives off. One of our cats LOVES to kick litter around the box excessively. He is a black cat and seemingly makes it his mission to come out of the box with all four legs (and some of his head) entirely COVERED in this fine litter dust. He then tracks litter dust paw prints all across the couch, and everywhere else he comes into contact with. Our other cat uses the litter normally and we haven't had any problems. Litter-flinging cat owners beware!"

I tried to cancel the filter order, but it was already in the mail. KV Vet Supply refused to work with me to resolve this issue. This bait and switch attempt was reported to Amazon - but the only response was customer service rep from India not understanding why this bait and switch price increase was a problem.

While she was really happy and focused on it, as soon as I walked away, I think she had full intentions on destroying it. I went out to throw the trash in the truck (about 4 min) and came back to half a 'jack'. I still fill it with spray cheese and let her chew, but I definitely don't leave her alone. If you purchase for a power chewer, make sure you can keep an eye on them. It's not very durable."

I have bought $20 toys that were touted as tough enough to withstand aggressive chewers but they are often destroyed within a few days or sometimes a few hours. I bought this item because I needed to spend $3 more to get free shipping and it was a great buy! My dog carried that goose around for 3 weeks before it finally got a hole in it during tug of war. He would even carry it to bed with him and sleep with it! Not everyone can be pleased a toy lasted 3 weeks but for a $3 toy, that's a miracle in my house!

It can maintain acceptable water level for 2 - 4 days, depending on the temperature so a weekend trip is doable.My unit is virtually silent. I suspect the noise that others talk about is due low water levels. In fact, that is my signal to add water.Adding water is easy and quick.DO NOT forget about filters.

She clearly stated this.It looks like a great product,but I am very hesitant to feed them to my dog.I Googled all the information about the the dog deaths linked to Chicken Jerky Treats from China.This brand was NOT on the list, but I read enough to be concerned about where they come from.I will be exchanging the Chix Mix for the Beef Hooves tomorrow."

This birdfeeder came in one of the largest boxes I have seen in quite some time, and there was very little packing around the birdfeeder itself.When I went to hang the birdfeeder on the side of my house, it promptly fell off its hook and immediately broke in several places since the plastic it was made of is not of the best quality.The birdfeeder does look nice when it comes out of its packaging, but be wary and be very careful as you put it up."
153111,0,"I was truly amazed at how nice it was not to have to stoop and dig for cat feces and clumped up urine. It appeared that my cat adjusted quite well to the Cat Genie (would visibly see poop in the granules). But after 2-3 months we noticed our basement was smelling very badly of urine/ammonia. Then we discovered my picky cat was urinating ender the stairs rather than in her new, fancy & expensive litter box. I think she does not like the idea of the granules not ""clumping"" after she urinates. Otherwise why would she be ok to bury her poop in the Cat Genie?We did not have the patience or tolerance to wait any longer for my cat to adjust. We have since gone back to her old ""manual"" litter box with generic litter. It seems my cat prefers the cheaper stuff! I would recommend trying out a used Cat Genie rather than investing in a brand new one in case your cat doesn't adopt it. =)"

That being said the batteries are going dead after just two days. I only buzzed the dog twice in two days and the batteries were dead on the third. I think you might have to turn off the dog collar itself to keep this from happening. This is a pain. It should go into idle mode or something to prevent this. Other collars have this feature.

This new one cleans well about half the time, the other times is doesn't pick up all the deposits. The tines don't reach all the way to the bottom, so you still have to scrape wet litter off the bottom occasionally. But, all in all, it's better than cleaning the box 8 times a day (my cats are picky), just an occasional check and quick scoop, otherwise I have a lot more free time! BTW, I use Worlds Best Litter, it's made from corn, all natural, no toxic clay dust or additives. It makes the box fairly odorless, and clumps OK. I think a better clumper might work better in the Littermaid, but I'm not trading the all natural benefit for my cats just for convenience for me."

While my dog does suffer from extreme flea algeries and we do live at the beach in So CA, my pooch is on Capstar and Frontline Plus year round.Let me start by saying I usually use Head and Shoulders mixed with another Oatmeal shampoo. (This was a formula recommended by my vet).I shouldn't have made the change from prducts that had a 90% effective rate, but here's what the product (Miracle Coat Soothing Shampoo)promised:1.Conditions dry, irritated skin2.Relieves itching and flaking3.Helps soothe skin irritations due to flea and tick problems4.Repairs coat while restoring skin's natural moisture5.Rich in botanicals and colloidal oatmealHere is how these statement translated to how my dog felt/looked/smelled after her first bath with MCSSSforD:1.All oil stripped from skin and not returning even after 10 days since bathing with product. Some areas of skin (that were fine before) are a bright pink (lower bely and inside of back legs, armpits, base of tail all around, inside of right ear. This does NO have anything to do with fleas.2.Itching and flaking more pronounced after use of product. I KNOW I rinsed all of the product off after the bath - I spend twice as much time rinsing as I do washing.3.Again, my poor dog's skin is anything but soothed.4.As for repairing the coat, my dog lost 99% of her undercoat after using the product.5.Had a fruity smell that produced a few sneezes. The smell of the product was nowhere to be found on after her bath, and her summer dog smell returned in a matter of days after the bath.I don't believe that this is a harmful product, but I do wonder if other pet parents will have the same experience if their dog has even the slghtest tendency towards sensitive skin."

We're on week 4 and the adhesive is not holding the velcro to the door, so we'll have to get some gorilla glue to make sure it stays in place. For the price, we are pleased with this product.

29547,0,"Before we found Alpo's ""Prime Slices"", my husband & I tried a few different canned dog foods to mix with the dry food we prepare for our eldest dog (who is currently 1 1/2 years old) - and ""Hearty Classics"" was one of them. And, although he seemed to like it o.k., I found it to be difficult to mix in with the dry food - as I like to have a nice mix of both the wet and the dry.""Hearty Classics"" without gravy actually takes on the shape of the can, so you have to literally dig it out. Then, once you have the amount you want in the food bowl, you then have to spend the time cutting & ""mishing"" it all up - which is not a good thing when you have 3 dogs excitedly waiting for their meals...Overall, I would not recommend this particular type of Alpo. Instead, I suggest you try Alpo's ""Prime Slices"", which has a very nice mix of meat & gravy - allowing you to just pour it in with the dry & give it a good stir. ""Prime Slices"" is not only a time saver, but is also a HUGE favorite with our adult dog."

114845,0,"I purchased this bed because my dog likes making little ""dens."" His favorite is the small space between our bed skirt and under-bed drawers. But he doesn't like to burrow or be under blankets (so perhaps this bed wasn't really suited to him). First of all, I echo other people who noted that the cushion is so high that the dog can tip if s/he's near the edge. So that was the first thing I fixed. I removed the pad, and using dental floss (because it's so strong) sewed a seam 5 or so inches from the edge. As I sewed, I pushed some of the stuffing into the new edge, then tightened the ""thread"" (which is why floss is so important- regular thread would have snapped). This created a firmer, raised edge, like you see on many dog beds. This also lowered the overall height of the pad, and gives it a more stable base with a firm outer exterior. My dog also likes to rest his head on something elevated, so the new edge allows him to do that. But even after that, he would only lay on the outer 1/3 of the bed. Again, perhaps I shouldn't have purchased this bed since he doesn't burrow. So onto the second alteration. I inserted straightened plastic-coated wire hangers from the dry cleaner (we used 2, duct taped together) into the top hood (between the outer fabric and the fleece) to make another support to keep it open (we probably could have gone to the hardware store to find tubing like is used in the front of the bed). Then I sewed it into place. We decided that our dog would also benefit from yet another support, so we did it again, and this time I sewed it into the very back of the hood. The result is that now the whole top of the ""cave"" stays open. There is nothing to hang down and touch our dog. And now he loves it and will lay deep inside. I just hope that even though it's now so open, it still keeps him warmer than if he was in a regular bed."
69200,0,"Product does a good job of protecting your car seats, but in the case of liquid accidents, the material absorbs NOTHING and therfore the liquid will roll around and around. Also, the range of adjustments that can be made to the hammock to make it fit and work in your car's space is VERY limited. Finally, the hammock doesn't stay in place and shifts easily, especially when your pet is unsettled and moving around in the back seat. You still need to have lots of absorbent towels for clean ups, and if you do not have your pet in a seat belt, some other barrier to keep them from trying to climb into the front seat"
176226,0,"Halo ""Daily Greens"" was one of the rare vitamin products that my finicky 21 year old kitty would tolerate. When I could no longer find it locally, I searched for it online and reordered from this seller. Delivery was a bit slow, but free--a fair compromise. What saddened me is that the vitamin formula must have been changed (or perhaps the batch I rcvd was not up to par in some way). When crushed and/or added to liquid, it's color was vastly different from that of my previous batch. It also smelled very STRONG and was not palatable to my kitty. Where were the ""greens"" that manifested themselves in the color and scent of the older version? Finding another satisfactory vitamin supplement will require more trial and error, but I won't order the Halo ""Daily Greens"" again."
204583,0,I ordered this carrier to use for vet trips for my adult cats. The size is good enough for one adult cat. I was disappointed in the construction of this carrier. The plastic is very flimsy. I am going to use the zip ties as recommended to secure the top and bottom pieces. I just won't be able to take the carrier apart if my kitty doesn't want to come out. I was hoping this carrier would have been a little larger and more well constructed.
49165,1,"I bought mine today (large sized) at Big Lots for $50.00. I am very happy with the quality and size. The construction seems to be made to last for years and years with the heavy duty zippers and mesh materials. Even the rods are of metal (glad they didn't skimp and make them plastic). I have nothing bad to say about this item. I bought the one with the solid canvas on either end, not the one pictured, still I am extremely happy with it even though other reviewers were expecting the mesh on all four sides and are complaining just because they were surprised to get something other than what was being advertised, I guess I would have been somewhat angry if that were the case.This item is easy to set up and take down in seconds, perfect for traveling. Highly recommend this crate."
78469,1,This is the only dog harness that I have found for my large dogs that restricts surging forward in a gentle manner. Love it!
38879,1,"I have been searching for a low maintenance litter box. I'm a single mom, working full time with two cats. The two things I hate most is the chore of cleaning a smelly cat box and coming home to a smelly cat box. It kills the mood of wanting to cook dinner for sure!Motorized boxes are expensive and motors break. I watched the video and was sold. I couldn't wait for my cats to try it just so I could clean the box. What took me 10-15 smelly minutes to do before only takes 2-3 odorless minutes to do now. It's truly no longer a chore."
183147,0,"I HIGHLY recommend this toy for medium to large dogs that are light to medium chewers. It is a ton of fun to play chase or fetch games with and most dogs really like the texture for chewing. But be warned. No matter what the package says, THIS IS NOT A TOY FOR STRONG CHEWERS!!!My Australian Cattle Dog LOVES the Orka Jack Chew, but she loves it a little too much and ends up destroying it. She will meticulously chew off one leg at a time. It is amazing to watch. But the product is borderline pricy for something that is destroyed (all 6 legs removed) in less than 2 weeks. Also, I worry about her health as many small pieces are swallowed no matter how close I watch her with the toy.This toy is AWESOME for chase or fetch. It bounces like crazy and floats. But the dog prefers to chew this toy, so the human ends up doing most of the running and fetching to keep the toy in one piece. We have lots of other toys that fit the ""fetch"" category which I don't have to watch like a hawlk. So now that two which we bought are dead and gone, we will not be repurchasing this toy.Toys that pass the ACD chew test:Kong (we still use the Red, have not had to upgrade to Black yet)LARGE sized Nylabone for Heavy chewersFresh moose antlerschuck it balls (but these are always getting lost)Pickle PocketToys we thought would work that failed:Kong Frisbee (died in 5 minutes of fetch)Kyjen Fire Hose (died in 5 minutes of fetch/chew)Orka Chew (died in 2 hours of chew, GREAT for fetch but dog prefers this toy for chew)West Paw Bumi (died in 5 minutes of chew, GREAT for fetch and tug)PawTrack (dogs just don't like chewing it, loved shredding the rope)Any Rope toy is shredded into a mess in minutes (OK for tug, but still gets messy)"
90694,0,"The dog doesn't really sleep on it. I think it's because the cover isn't actually soft. It feels like a tarp, but rougher. I put a towel over it and she'll sleep there occasionally, but I mostly find her on the floor behind it or on the rug. It was really easy to set up, just four screws. Cleaning the top isn't as easy as I'd imagined either. You have to take the whole thing apart to get it off and wash it. Unless you just hose it down or something. Overall, I'd recommend it if your dog isn't a princess or doesn't mind a scaly, rough surface to lie on."

167818,0,"I was surprised when I received this formerly ""perfect"" treat. I had gotten all my dog club friends a large bag for Christmas. In this more recent shipment the product was different in that the pieces were twice as large as in the past. This means it goes 1/2 as far. What an unpleasant surprise. My dogs still love it as much, but in this time of economizing I am not pleased with the change."
150669,1,My 2 cats were destroying furniture and carpet. I got soft paws and they worked! No issues with them.both my cats will chew at them in the beginning but they didn't get any off and they got used to them by the second day!the applying process was quick. My boyfriend did a great job applying them I think that's a big part of having success with soft paws is getting the right size and applying correctly.i would highly recommend trying!
3264,1,I love this collar! I have bought about four of them over the years. I use them for my Yorkie and my Chihuahua. I really like the break away feature...I don't have to worry about them getting caught up in something and getting hurt. Shipping was fast.

49804,0,"I had a VERY sick Betta fish. He had a couple white spots on him that looked like a fungus or something. I researched for a whole day online trying to find out what was wrong with my betta and what was the proper medicaine to help him get better. I bought this medicine and received it over night. I gave him the medicine and not much seemed to happen. it was almost like the medicine made it worse. I bought some Betta Revive and it seems to be helping. But none of this can be used long term. It worrys me cause my Betta is still sick acting and the white spots aren't going away. :( i'm not sure what to do or what i can do. I don't want to say that this medicine doesn't work. It very well might work of you KNOW that your betta has a fungus infection. this medicine is also supposed to help with bacteria infections. I have heard only good things about this medicine. It didn't work for my Betta, but i don't know what's worng with him. If you know your Betta has these type of infections i would atleast try it, everyone has had luck with it."
211121,0,"My hamster loves this cage. I didn't take him long to transition from his old cage to this one. It has a lot cool features like the tunnels of tubing and the second level. BUT IT IS A HORROR TO BUILD! When the cage arrived I was hopeful for the best but didn't expect to much (as the box made the product seem like one of those straight-from-china ok-but-not-great kinda items). When open the metal parts were ok and the plastic parts seemed cheap. The cage also came with NO DIRECTIONS AT ALL. I was forced to build the cage with the picture on the box as my only guidelines. That said - Everything is pretty clear and easy to build. The plastic tubing is awful to put together. It is extremely hard to join them together and attach to the cage! (I had to lean against my walls in order to snap the pink support rings into place). The is also poorly positioned in the cage and the hamster has never touched it.I give the cage 3 stars because the hamster likes it so much! He really does love it. But do expect to break your head, stump your mind, curse a bit, hurt your fingers and break a nail or too."
205262,2,"I found this collar very difficult to juice up initially. When it finally did get properly loaded, I used it for several weeks, recharging it in between. Then it worked quite well and my dog was much better behaved. I did not need to use it for several months, then when I tried to juice it up again it would not hold the charge. Now it had died completely even though I have replaced the battery."
84286,1,"Admittedly, we use this pad less for keeping pets warm than for keeping food and water from freezing in the century-old shack the former owner laughingly called a ""garage"" for our revolving population of stray cats - but it's held up over two winters and seems to be going strong through one of the worst blizzards in recent memory. Sometimes when it's cold but not freezing so we keep the food on the flor, we see cats resting on it and they seem very happy.We have a smaller version we keep on the unenclosed front porch, also mainly for food and water, and again it's lasted two winters without a problem and is making it through the blizzard just fine."

79451,2,The mechanics of this gate were fine but the quality of the wood needs some improvement. The wood is extremely soft which allowed my 10lb dachshund to pull it down and eventually eat through it. I had to make repairs and modifications in less than a week of use. I ended up having to replace it in a little over a month.
122022,0,We don't keep the bulb on constantly and we did not get the hours mentioned. We only used ours for 5 months and now purchased a new one. We use it to keep our bird warm during the winter months.
19500,1,"This is easy to use and perfect for traveling in the car. Our dogs love it because it does give them more room than our last pet seat belt - they can sit, stand, or lie down with it on."
29306,0,"It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but my kitten does like to scratch it. She definitely uses it, but I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a carpet covered mouse in the hole like it described in the information. Instead there's a little ball with colored tassels on it... just seems like a weird toy for a cat. I think she would have liked the mouse better. Otherwise, it's a good product. She loved the catnip I sprinkled on it."
174457,1,"I purchased a ZoomGroom for my cat. He was beginning to shed quite a bit and the slicker brush I had wasn't doing the job, plus he didn't enjoy being brushed with it. When I received the ZoomGroom we went into the bathroom and sat on the floor and he just melted in my lap while I brushed him. The amount of hair that was in the brush, on the floor, and on me was incredible, and when I was done I finished him off with aLove Glove Grooming Mitt for Catsto get rid of the loose hair still on him. He loved the massage and attention, so much so that he will pick up the ZoomGroom and carry it into the bathroom. I still use it even when I don't think he's shedding much and it finds hair I didn't even know was there. Just be warned, the first time using this the fur will fly!"
87504,0,I'm not convinced on this brand yet but we are trying it. A crf cat needs low protein and low phosphorous. The data on this from Tanya's guide for Crf cats shows this has pretty high phosphorous for a renal food. .72% vs .38% on the K/D. Also has 36% protein vs. 28% with the K/D. Its more equal to senior formula foods than the prescription foods. It might not be the best choice. It does have high fat though vs other brands which is my hope for keeping some weight on my 18 year old crf cat.
113364,2,It is a nice little bed but it is to hard to clean and get dirty fast. My dog does like the plush sides of it though.
77862,1,"I was a little worried about setting up something like this, but I literally had it all set up in about 3 minutes. I didn't put the divider panel in because my dog is previously crate trained, and I bought this so he could have something bigger and more comfortable...and less smelly than the plastic crate he was in. As a point of reference (I would have found this helpful) I bought the 36 inch crate for my 5 month old 30 lb AmStaff/GSD cross. He has PLENTY of room in it and it is very secure. I would highly recommend this crate for a dog between 25-60lbs."
20197,1,"This is a fantastic product! Our elderly cat (now 21) has used these litter boxes for years. Older cats produce a lot of urine, and we were having to replace the disposable plastic litter box liner practically every day to keep the odor down. Using the Kitty's WonderBox means no more expensive plastic liners, NO ODOR, and we can scoop or dump out the litter and still use the same box for a week or more. It's amazing. These boxes also work great for cats who shred the disposable liners by kicking or trying to bury things, etc. The boxes are virtually indestructable. I'd recommend them for any cat."
70605,0,The product works well a a temporary fix-the only way to fix the problem is to do daily water changes until issue is cleared.
75179,0,"Was an entertaining toy for my 2 cats (9yrs & 7yrs). My cats are very playful but seriously have a bad case of A.D.DThey played with this for about 45 minutes straight the first day it came and maybe an hour total since in the year we have owned it. They have gotten bored, they got used to the tricks and will catch the little mouse and hold on to it and kill it, so all you hear is the motor TRYING to work but the cats are holding it down!But, when they do play with it, it is entertaining for us to watch them play with it as it is for them to actually play! :)"
25716,1,This heater pad stays warm for hours. My cat loves hers and I ordered one for me that I love. Miss Kitty is curled up and warm on top of the bookcase and I put mine behind my back on the couch. Great product.
203906,1,"I bought this bed for my skinny 30-pound dog. In winter, she gets cold sometimes during the night even though we live in the South and this bed works great, since it keeps her warm. I wish, like with many other dog beds, that is was really washable. But since the cover is not removable, there is no way to clean it properly."
145051,0,"My Golden didn't seem too phased by the taste of this stuff when it was put on his leash to try and keep him from biting it. However, I do know of other dogs this has worked well for, so I'm sure it just depends on the dog."
193944,1,I installed my pet door 8 years ago and it is used constantly by my large 100 lb dog and 1 cat. It works great!! Just receintly the outside part of the flap broke so I am buying a replacement. I have it installed through the wall of my home and I love it!!
97432,1,"I searched and searched for this product. It really helps groom my Pomeranian pets and it has one of the best aromas out there. Very Berry is the best. I also recommend the ""Rainforest"" one too."
137269,1,We bought two of these. One for food and one for water. The sides on the bowl are high enough that the water does not splash out while driving. The seams are done very well and do not leak at all. We had water in the bowl for over a week while out of town for the holidays. I would surely recommend this to other people.
55040,0,When I got this in the mail I was slightly disappointed. but my exceptions may have been a bit high for a cat toy that was just a couple of bucks. It functions exactly the way it said it would.
198935,2,"We bought this product to try and teach our 65 pound, 7 month old dog not to jump our fence. It failed miserably. First, though the instructions and illustrations make it look easy to put the harness on the dog, it is not easy. The straps all look alike and the buckles are interchangeable. When we finally got the harness on and fitted properly, our dog chewed the straps to pieces in only minutes. The webbing straps are flimsy and thin, and would probably not have restrained our dog even had she not destroyed the harness. Don't waste your money."
17711,1,The anti-bark collar worked the 2nd time it was on our Irish setter. This is a wonderful/humane product for the slightly to highly emotional animal.

121408,0,"The dish is fine - works as advertised & is cleverly designed & operates quietly. The problem is my geriatric cat who couldn't even be tempted to eat from the open tray, never mind once the mechanism was in place. He's 18 & goes through periods of wanting to eat every 3 hours, day or night - a bit rough on those of us who'd like an uninterrupted sleep. So I thought I'd try the auto-feeder. Oh. Well."
40785,1,"We've been using this product for many years. Now after moving from North Pole Alaska, I can't find it anywhere but Petco or Petsmart. I don't like either chain so I was really happy to find it at Amazon. I love shopping with them."

92690,0,"This ball contains two locks on the polar sides of the ball to let chinchilla in (and out) . Very soon they lost their shape, became corrupted and now it's not as easy to lock chinchilla in as before.I do not like the product from this manufacturer for this reason (corruptable plastic)"
21812,0,"We bought this door so we could put the litter box in the garage to keep it out of reach of our puppy. It worked for the past year or so, and the dogs also love to put their heads through to see us leaving and coming home. It worked well for our purpose, except after about 8 months of heavy daily use, the magnetic strip that keeps the door from flapping broke clean off and the 4-way lock quickly jammed. We don't us it, so it's no big deal, but the door swinging back and forth sure is annoying!Also large cat breeds like Maine Coons may have some trouble with this. Our cats are large DSHs and have a hard time squeezing through. In the beginning this led to some difficulty to teaching them to use it."
211420,0,"I liked this folding design and the steps were of decent quality, but even with the treads applied my dogs paws slipped around way too much. Also, the spacing, size, and height of the steps is best suited for small dogs with short legs, like a Yorkie or Chihuahua"

130808,0,"This has a very strong (fishy?) smell which offends the two cats I tried to give it to. I'm pretty good with giving medication to my mellow animals, but when I did get some of this into one cat, he ran off. The other took one sniff and didn't hang around for more. Whether it's effective remains to be seen. If I could get it into the one with the stomach issues, I'd have a better idea. I might just try slippery elm on its own."
84778,0,"I purchased the Petmate Le Bistro pet feeder for several reasons and it has lived up to my initial expectations. I would recommend it with some reservations...THE GOOD:1) I wanted a reliable feeder to automatically dole out small portions of food for my compulsively over-eating cat when I went away on short weekend trips. If you follow the instructions, you can work through the anti-intuitive programming to get the thing programmed and working properly.2) I was sure my cat would destroy the machine the first time I went away. My aggressive large male cat rips open bags of dry food in less than 1 second, and all plastic food containers need reinforcement. He tried to bust open the Le Bistro with all his might, but only managed to push the machine around the room. On two occasions in the year-plus that we've had the machine, he has managed to pop the top off of the food bin, and it was because he had observed the refilling of the machine earlier in the day.3) BONUS: My cat used to start yowling loudly for food every morning at 4AM. I realized that I could program the feeder to feed him his morning meal. Now he sits next to his machine and purrs at 5AM, eats when it feeds him, and goes back to sleep.THE BAD:1) The first and last time I tried to program the machine without referencing the instruction sheet, I hit the ""Set"" and ""Plus"" buttons at the same time and watched in horror as the machine starting doling out all of its food. I had to scramble to find the instruction sheet while fat kitty munched happily away at the mounds of food pouring out of his new best friend.2) I've noticed that the ""low battery"" light only lights up when it is trying to use its motor, so I don't see it because the machine is used for feeding the cat when I'm not there. The first time this occurred, my cat meowed and pestered me so much, that I went to the feeder and tried to do a manual feed. As it tried to use its motor, the machine's red ""low battery"" light lit up. My vocal cat helped me realize that his machine needed new batteries that time, but it seems like a terrible design flaw because it could happen while I was away for a long weekend and the cat would go hungry. Fortunately the batteries don't need to be changed very often, but I would still be cautious about the batteries if you are leaving for a long time.3) When I go away my cat likes to push his feeder around and try to get it open. One time he managed to flip the whole machine over on its side, which meant that the food no longer had gravity on its side and never found its way to the chute. Now I have to tape the machine to the floor so it doesn't happen."
160816,1,"I bought this at the suggestion of a volunteer for the rescue organization from which I adopted my second cat. She was very timid, whereas my first cat is outgoing, and was bullying her. The rescuer said that she has seen cats get so caught up in playing with this toy that they forget to be enemies...I haven't seen my cats playing with this *together* yet, but they each love it, despite their very different personalities. Both love to bat the ball around, scratch the cardboard, and sit in the middle. This is especially remarkable considering that my shy cat doesn't even bat an eye when I wave very tempting feather toys in front of her, which the outgoing cat would go ga-ga for.This ball track toy is much sturdier than those offered by other brands. Highly recommended!"
16817,0,"The citronella spray collar is great except that it is much too sensitive. I have taped multiple layers of padding over the microphone, yet it still sprays when my dog sneezes or shakes his head (he has floppy ears). I'm trying different materials to see if something else may work better to muffle ""regular"" noises but still allow barking to trigger the spray."
184684,2,"I cannot recommend this product. First of all, when I opened the jar the odor was overwhelming (clove and vinegar). I let each of my Yorkies smell them to see what they thought. Each one had the same reaction: sniffed, shook his head, and ran away. I always taste any medicine that I give my dogs for palatability to see if I need to put it into a Pill Pocket or food to disquise the flavor so I opted to taste this. OMG, it was so nasty bitter; and I could not get that taste out of my mouth for the longest time. I put the lid back on the jar and threw them in the trash. I would never use something so vile on my dog. In my opinion using these on your pet would be animal abuse. My heart goes out to all the dogs the manufacturer tested these on."
81703,0,"Pros:Design of the fabric and the tie-downs is top notch. Fits many configurations well I'd assume.Nice color.Cons:*NOT* waterproof. ""Water-Resistant"" might be a better word. My pooch tossed his lunch up, soaked thru to the clothe seat. Not too excited about that.There are too many holes where they allowed for seat-belt-thrus in the design, which is pointless. Look, the dog mess is going to get thru those slots into the clothe seats. Those seat-belt-thrus should have a flap over them with velcro or something.As it is, if you put another blanket under this blanket, then you have a good solution. This cover is very well priced, and definitely holds in place. If you need to protect against liquids, put something underneath it though."
47448,2,"I bought this for my 15lb puppy under the assumption that it could hold up for simp rain and wind protection, I was wrong. Not only was the assembly rediculously difficult(none of the pieces lined up correctly, and the screws didnt even hold it together),my puppy ended up sleeping under my bed when it rained due to the fact that the house was flooded. To make matters worse, my puppy decided she wanted to get ontop of the crappy house. She ended up breaking it and getting cut...now I'm paying for a vet bill to stitch her up, extremely useless and dangerous for anything over 10lbs."
52816,0,My Wiener Dog is terrified of this house but it's very pretty and very easy to assemble! :) I hope everyone else has a dog that's not scared like mine! :) It looks pretty in my back yard! But my dog won't go near it! LOL
61674,2,I am disabled and had owned a LitterMaid once before. It made taking care of my cats much easier. I ordered this one thinking I would get the same quality as in the past but found that the standards were much lower. The fingers for the scoop used to be solid plastic but now they are a flimsy metal that is so flexible it lets most of what you are trying to scoop pass below this. I tried a little more litter to raise it up but the motor is incapable of pushing it even though it is far from being over filled. The box itself is not secure. The old boxes had latches to hold it together this one just sits on itself. This comes to be a problem with the lid when it tries to close. If the box has shifted even an eighth of an inch the lid hangs open releasing all the pleasant smelling oder into the air. The trays are harder to insert where they work. Many time they are lifted up and the poop and junk go behind it to the floor. LitterMaid needs to hire new R& D people. They have taken a good product and made it more difficult to use and less effective for more money. Once again the disabled get taken in with the shisters!!!
97356,1,"This is arguably as good or better than the top quality screen lids you can buy from petstores - for a fraction of the price.

However, he only managed to tear the tongue off the chameleon (in less than 2 minutes) and still has the rest today (2 weeks later) he likes the toy and plays with it all the time. Overall it's pretty durable but if your dog is a chewer and destroys toys in 3 seconds flat don't expect much!"

33887,0,"This toy is much safer than the push-and-play hard plastic ball, as it didn't cause any bloody noses. However, once the rope was removed, my dogs were able to chew off pieces of it near the hole that goes all the way through. One of my German Shepherds played with her ball for months before destroying the ball, but my more aggressive chewing male tore his up in less than a week."
216989,2,"This was my first feeder. I bought it based on looks and the overall good ratings. I had two birds visiting it in no time. Unfortunately I don't have a garden to attract more so they didn't go through the nectar very fast, and I had to toss 2/3. This feeder has a narrow opening making it challenging to clean. First time I went to clean it, I discovered a crack in the neck, that wasn't there the first time I filled it up. I wont be putting this back up for fear that the bottom half is going to break off completely."

178959,0,"Hi,Bought this for a momma and her kitten. The momma (1 year old) took to this and was adjusting well to the hole. The kitten on the other hand is having difficulty but she is following her momma but did not like the sound of poop hitting the water. It could be that she is too young (3 months). For now, we are back to traditional litter box until she is older and will try again."
119421,1,"is good product resistant and is good for really big dogs german sheaperd, malinois, etc etc because is kind of heavy but you have to put sand inside and that is not an easy job because the hole is really small but the effort worth the estability that the ball doesn't go over your neighbord fence"
37977,0,"I've had this litter box for a couple of months - I think its a good product, but have had some issues.First, I read the reviews before purchasing this product and was convinced that if I used the product in the RIGHT way, I'd have a great product! My impression was that the lower ratings were chalked up to user error.Now it's only happened twice so far but WHAT A MESS when it did! When tilting the litter box to the right to get the waste into the pan, what I thought was a securely latched side obviously wasn't because litter and small piece of pooh suddenly started to leak ALL OVER THE CARPET! This happened once in the morning when I thought I'd be making a quick job of emptying the litterbox and, to my dismay, it became a 15 minute project of scooping, vacuuming and cursing at the stupid thing.BUT it HAS worked effectively since, so I have to believe that one must really test the security of the latches before trying to tilt. The latches can appear to be latched when they really aren't solidly together and I think this was my problem both times. As one should be adding more litter often, or cleaning it thoroughly occassionally, I frequently take the lid off (how can you only take it off 4 times a year, as one reviewer said?!) and spend an extra few minutes ensuring that they truly are LATCHED to the bottom piece - which is difficult because they don't line up to latch perfectly.This is a good product and, if the latch system was perfected, it would be a GREAT product and would have gotten 5 stars. 3-star review for the horrific episodes of cleaning cat litter and feces out of my carpet on two occassions after only two months of having it."
141,1,"This is the BEST product I have found to keep my dogs from pulling while on walks. They both wear one, and I am no longer jerked ahead when they see something they want to run after!!! It took a little time to get them used to it, but I just had little pieces of treats that I would give to my girls when they would try to paw it off. We have been using it almost daily for a month now, and my dogs walk just fine with them on! Great investment if you have dogs that like to walk you!!"
52927,0,I really like this bird bath. I received mines in yellow. Unfortunately my parakeets ignored it the whole time. I finally had to take it out cause it got soiled with droppings. Would have like if it had an attachment so it could hand off the side of the cage and not on the floor of the cage.
95337,1,"I purchased this harness for my 30# hound dog because she loves to ride in the truck, but the ride was too rickety for her to be comfortable. I also liked the fact that she couldn't leap out of the truck when I opened the door. Recently, we had a reason to never travel without it again. I was driving down a twisty two lane road when a driver coming in the opposite direction was distracted momentarily and swerved into my lane. I swerved to miss them but my truck lost control and we rolled over into the ditch on the opposite side of the road. My dog was securely fastened in her harness and I remember her flailing around, but securely attached! The truck landed on the driver's side door and she was dangling over my head. Had we not had her secured with the harness, she could have flown around or out of the truck and severely injured one or both of us. I will promote this product to everyone I meet with a dog, it saved our lives!!"

4418,0,"This cat scratcher pad is fine in quality, my cat loves it in his toy with the ball track. The only problem is that it is advertised as 2 replacement pads but I only got 1. in reality, it is an incredibly cheap thing to manufacture so i bought it thinking I was getting an almost reasonable price for 2 pads instead i'm paying almost $8 for rolled cardboard. Granted my cat loves it and I would have been completely satisfied with 2 but that is not what I received."
190167,2,"If you are accustomed to pack walking your dogs this leash will do nothing for you. I bought it on a lark. In a pack walk both (or multiple dogs) walk in groups. On the odd occassion one may have trouble going to the bathroom, the other dog can pull on it without your control. Impractical product...unless your dogs aren't trained to pack walk, then it might be useful.Loops 2 Double Handle Nylon Leash, 6-Foot, Blue"
97398,2,This mat takes a long time to soak in water and the mat is not even. The bumpy strips of gell are a result and there is no smooth surface. The mat is very wet after soaking it in water and heavy. My dog refused to even go on it. I'm returning it!
1471,2,"Great idea - but the remote is way to sensitive. I try to be very careful with it, but if you ever put it in your pocket you are likely to fire at the wrong time. That is not fair to the dog and will ruin any positive impact I hope to gain from this as a training device.The buttons should be inset, have a cover, or require holding for a couple seconds before firing to prevent this issue."
90679,0,I really like the concept but don't feel the construction quality is up to par. I own one for indoor use and it is much sturdier. I have had the other one for about 5 years now and it's in great shape. I forget the manufacturer but it's by far a better quality. I thought that since my dogs were used to this same concept for their indoor bed they would just take to this outdoor one. Not the case. My dogs don't like the fact that they just sink into it and it's wobbly. They are a bit skittish. They will lay in it if I call them over to it but quickly feel unstable and jump off. Wouldn't have minded paying a bit more for better construction. Still hoping the dogs will adapt to this bed a bit more. Just giving it a little longer.
208081,0,"I can't get my dog to wear these. She'd rather walk on ice. Actually she'd rather sit on ice because it's too cold to walk. The biggest problem I have with them is that they are too hard to put on. I think I could get my dog used to them if I used them more consistently but when it takes 5 minutes per foot, I just give up. That's what puppy pads are for."
13704,0,"a 150-pack box usually lasts us about 4 months with one mid-size dog. These Wee-Wee pads are fine, but they used to be better -- does anyone remember when the blue borders used to be made of an absorbent material with a continuous plastic underlay? I think the design changed about a year ago, but since then, if my dog miss-aims and urinates too close to the blue border, urine leaks through the pad onto the floor, whereas before, the plastic underlay locked in the moisture from leaking out."
154254,1,"I've had this litter box for about 6 months and I LOVE it. I have one small cat and live in a little apartment and I can't smell the box. I had a regular litter box before I bought this one and I was cleaning it at least 3 times a day and I could still smell it. I can go at least 3 weeks without even touching this box and still not smell it. It is supposed to go for a month and it gets really close, I think it could if I didnt have to have mine in a semi-public area. It is super easy, pretty quiet and it just really works well. The only reason its not perfect is that my cat still drops some litter on the floor on the way out. It is totally worth every penny!"
215237,0,"It arrived in the box, as described. When I took the pieces out to assemble it, two tiny plastic clips broke off. It is definitely made of cheap chinese plastic, but functions fine without the clips. I would say it is overpriced for the quality, but I had a gift certificate and got it free. All in all, I would never pay full price for it."
101421,0,"Just wish this came in smaller size as it looked great on my dog, just would not stay on his feet two seconds. Had to return. Fortunately return was very easy and full refund was given."
71082,1,I personally don't love it but my 2 puppies love it and my 1 old chi also eats it more than his other senior food.
199187,1,This is a super tool for cats who shed a lot. My cat sheds constantly which drives me nuts. Using the FURminator cuts down on how much he sheds.
101523,2,"Unfortunately both of my cats turned their noses up at this product, and one of them would throw up after I put it on her food"
161236,1,This is easy to clip on & easy to get the bags out but after I ordered it I saw the same thing in a local store for a little less money & they had more colors to choose from. But the item itself is good.
76988,0,"Got this for a 9 month old stray (small female dog 16 pounds) since my husband thought steel was too much like prison. She figured out how to jump out in a few days--so husband put a ""roof"" on it (plywood). She literally chewed her way out (chewed at the rungs until they gave way and then wiggled out--not just one rung--several were gone). So--husband went and got a steel cage. She is fine now!"
165473,2,"The grass didn't grow very well. Granted, I didn't have the pet fountain in direct sunlight; it just isn't possible to place it where my cat can reach it and also be in the sun.Also, it created a white foam in the water, requiring me to change out the water and clean the unit weekly.Too bad, too, because I love the idea of it!"
111036,0,"It may well be that my hip is too far gone to be helped, other than surgery. But I received no relief after taking this for a month."
131280,0,The item is not as green as shown and is held down by cheap thin and narrow plastic that can not hold enough gravel or sand to weigh it down. I wish I would have passed on this stuff and purchased something that looked a bit more realistic. this just looks like cheap faux plants floating in my tank (floating because I am tired of putting my arm in 20 in of fish water to re-bury them!)
19108,0,i bought this for my pond to give it a water feature in the middle good flow rate but seems like the design has a flaw the foutain head does not screw onto the pump just slides onto the theaded port on the pump still somewhat tight fit to pump to hold it from blowing off

178571,1,"Love this tiny comb.... perfect for my standard size Yorkie ~ woof It works so well around face, be careful when combing. Dogs don't like to be brushed there. So a few mini treats distracts and makes it so much easier to comb out~"

149606,0,"The idea of this product seems to make sense, but it didn't work for me at all. I ordered it with refills and moved it around a few different places where I knew fleas would have been hiding, but nothing happened. I don't want to knock it down completely and I would rate it a 2.5 if I could. I think it's a smart contraption and if you have a big flea problem, it might work. I think it didn't work well for me, because I didn't have as big of a flea problem as I thought. Mine was a flea and bed bug problem combined. I didn't know about the bed bugs until recently and I can definitely tell the difference between a flea bite and a bed bug bite. Also, my cats had flea dirt and the vet confirmed they had fleas. Again, I just think my flea problem was minimal. So...this product didn't work for me at all, but it might work for someone else with a bigger flea problem."

197557,0,"I have three older cats who take arthritis pills. One also takes a thyroid pill. I decided to try the pill pockets. For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills. However, after three months:One cat still loves them. I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.I have figured out a few tricks that help:There are two types of pockets for cats: chicken and salmon. The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills. However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket. Then place the pocket so the treat faces down. My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it. After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat. She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket. Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat."
65433,1,These treats are great. Our dog gets excited everytime he sees us reaching for them. The container is also a welcome change to resealable bags. Its much cleaner and portable. Love this product!
146838,1,"I always have a bit of a mental pause when it comes to reviewing an item like this. How much can you say? I mean, it's a laser... for cats. Any cat caretaker with even a little bit of experience serving feline overlords knows - a laser = cat crack. They don't care if it's a good laser or bad, they don't care if the batteries need to be replaced weekly or never. It's crack, and even bad crack is good to them.But as a human serving her fuzzy mistress and master, I'm pretty happy with this crack. It isn't sucking down batteries like a cat laps milk... it's comfortable in the hand (unless you get poked by the stiff whiskers)... and the kitties love it. Oh, and it also seems to be considerably cheaper here than the alternatives usually found hanging on the small racks near the checkouts at stores. Another point in its favor.My cats like it, ergo, even if I had to replace batteries daily, it would get five stars. Since I don't have to go broke buying batteries, pretend I just gave it ten instead. ;)"
97395,0,"The harness was easy to put on and adjust, but might not be the most secure since my cat escaped from it. If a cat wriggles backwards, the adjustable lead on the top may become loose - it might not be the fault of the harness, maybe my cat is just extra wriggly."
105077,0,"I ordered this wheel 3 times. The first time was back in 2010, the wheel I ordered in 2010 seemed sturdy and did not arrive to me bent. I decided to order another wheel in 2011 just to freshen up my chinchilla's cage. The wheel arrived to me all bent up, and had sharp spokes, so I returned it. I just kept the wheel I bought in 2010, then this year 2012 when I bought my chinchilla a new cage I decided to try ordering a new wheel again, again, it came bent, but this time I bent it back into shape and kept it. This product seems to have a quality control problem. Overall I do like the wheel, but wish it was of the same quality that it was when I ordered it back in 2010."
77809,0,"I have an Australian/Border Collie mix who has separation anxiety. We trained her to eat in the crate and lay in the crate, but leaving her there when we walked out the door ... well... she wasn't ready for that. She escaped twice in one day by pushing on the side of the crate enough to get the bottom latch of the side door undone, then forced her way out. Her attempts/success in doing this, also made the front of the crate nearly fall off as it came undone some how. Now the crate has a total of 8 small luggage locks around the side door and the top corners to keep it together, but the dog is in daycare until we can better address the anxiety. Anyway, the crate is not good for dogs who really want out."
53640,2,We have had our Dachshund puppy for two weeks now and this particular toy is her least favorite thus far. She has over twelve toys and the only time she has played with it is when I put kibble inside and she didn't play too long. We are curious if she will like it more when she is in full teething mode! No reason to dislike it. It's the perfect size for her and is attractive and made well. I think it's just this dogs choice.
154165,2,"The bowls itself is fine but the base/hanger is super flimsy. If you fill it with water it bends. In my case, the dog getting a drink busted the weld on the hanger the first week. Disappointing."
79158,0,"The width of the straps on this is tiny. It's for a very very small dog. It's like the width of cat leashes. It says it would fit up to 20&#34; but it doesn't.The medium also has sizing issues--it says as small as 20&#34; and it is too big. Very annoying! My dog is sort of compact and the area with the martingale loop is too long--I can't get it small enough. The girth around her chest is fine and will adjust as needed--it's the front that's the problem.If you can get it to fit (I can, at the very smallest setting in the front, but then it starts slipping as we walk), it works great."
81890,0,"I bought this product online. After seeing the picture of the large dog and the cover extending over the sides of the seat, this is exactly what I wanted. Got it the next day! The cover is too short by a couple of inches to cover the rear bench seat in my F350 SuperCab. My dog doesn't lay in the middle. She sticks her head next to the door on either side so now I have slobber on the leather. Now I'm concerned about shrinkage when I wash it. This would be great in a small pickup or car. In my view the picture is misleading."
136602,1,"I like gadgets and hate cleaning litter boxes so over the years I have literally owned nearly every brand and model of automatic litter box that there is/was. Some, like Litter Robot, I have owned more than more one of. Over the years I have literally spent thousands on this issue in an attempt to automate a much hated chore. I also travel a bit and an automatic litter box makes for happy kitties...THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THESE PRODUCTS LAST OVER TIME. SOME OF THEM ARE OKAY AT FIRST.Put simply the Litter Robot is the only powered litter box that is worth buying; but it has several issues that I'll point out. There is also a cheap alternative.AUTOMATIC LITTER BOXES1) ALL of the various rake models leave clumps behind, get slime in the forks, and eventually break. The waste recepticals are all too small and are designed to be thrown away so they have you on the hook for life for overpriced supplies. I won't go into more detail, save your money. They are all a waste of time in the long run and either break or require so much maintenance and cleaning that you may as well be scooping the litter by hand. I never had one last longer than a year.2) The one that spins a flat pan and has a little conveyer belt to shuttle the waste away? So bad in so many ways it should be illegal to sell it... I threw it out even before it had a chance to break. Nuff said3) The expensive one that uses reusable waste pellets and then flushes the results down your toilet and is hooked up to a water source? If you have a poor sense of smell or can maybe put this in a garage or porch this might work for you but the supplies are expensive. I spent $650 on this puppy after buying accessories and plumbing it directly into the house. Even though it was in the basement the smell upstairs was pretty wretched when it was cleaning itself, but the real problem came when I had to clean the unit. It was such a mess and so disgusting a task that once again you may as well just scoop litter by hand and deal with a little grossness at a time. I eventually threw this one out fully ""functioning"" after I had to clean it the third time.4) I bought the original Litter Robot when it first came out. It had serious design flaws most of which they have fixed. When it broke the second time the new model was out so I tossed my first one. I now have two (and a half) of the new model which is notably better. This is the only powered litterbox I would recommend; but understand it is flawed as well.They break/jam fairly often. Sometimes I can fix it myself and sometimes it has to get sent back to the shop. To their credit, they have improved their customer service to a great extent and the response time and warranty is very good; which is fortunate because if your luck is like mine you will be needing it. (HINT: A can of compressed air can make a quick fix of most jams.)I have two and a half units because I had a breakdown at xmas one year and didn't have time to send in for a repair so I just bought an extra base on the net. It has been handy to have since I have a backup unit ready to go most times. The spare is recently broken and needs to go back now though. I also have extra circuit boards from various self repairs. That's a lot of fixes, parts, cash, etc. So be prepared. This isn't kitty litter utopia but it is as good as automated cat litter gets.The ball also gets coated with crud over time and needs a serious washing which is hard to do well. Hose it down on a hot day and leave the ball soaking in the sun to dry everything WELL.The Robot WILL smell more than a daily maintained manual litter box. Plus your cat is eventually surrounded by a ball coated in urine and fece dust that will gather over time. Luckily my cats don't rub up against the insides much, but it's a trade off if you want automation.I have read complaints about the waste tray on the Litter Robot and the way the bags attach, but I think the way they did it was brilliant. I just use regular tall kitchen bags (don't need the size but I buy them in bulk anyway and it is cheaper. Also leaves lots of bag to tie in a knot after it is filled.)It uses regular bags so that saves on costs and the Robot uses litter sparingly, I bet I use 1/4 of the litter that I used too.5) Don't want to pay for a Litter Robot and don't need a litter box that can tend to itself for a week at a time? There is a cheap option. There are various sizes of the ""Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box"" that is basically a Litter Robot without the motor. You do the rotating yourself but it is easy. This still beats manually scoopin the poopin in a major way and costs less than $50. Much better than the ""rake"" options, and easier to clean. I would buy the big one if you have room because this device has the same internal ""dust"" issue as the Litter Robot."
40425,0,"We have the regular and extra large versions of this box. The box works great for our 11-lb normal female tortie, who likes the high sides and generous headspace. Despite her age and slight arthritis, she has no trouble getting in and out. She pees a ""normal"" amount.Now, fire hose kitty.... Our 15-lb male kitty, who came to us via the humane society after being rescued, along with a few dozen other cats an dogs, from a subpar shelter/hoarder. He is the sweetest, happiest kitty in the world and is ecstatic to have a family. Like many cats rescued from hoarding conditions, even after several months of intensive vet care before being placed up for adoption, he has many medical complications and some peculiar behaviors.He does not enjoy using the box and generally avoids as long as possible, resulting in moments where the length and volume of his pissing inspired my husband to say ""I thought a homeless man had wandered in and was peeing in the corner of the study"". Fire hose kitty is also prone to UTIs, so we have to feed him lots of wet food and encourage excessive water consumption.Because of the volume of urine he excretes on his twice-daily box visits, he creates what we oh so fondly refer to as ""kitty concrete"" - football-sized clods if clumping litter, stuck in the corner of the box, that never dry and must be pried free.We tried a few different things -- putting in deeper litter (he just soaks through it) smacking the bottom of box, rolling after every pee, etc. What it came down to is, the drawer to remove wast is just too short to handle his clods, and would make a giant mess.Fire hose kitty also has digestive problems, which result in ""peanut butter poops"" in color and consistency. He does not like covering his poop, so we either have to cover it for him an hour or two before rolling or we end up with skid marks on the top of the box, the drawer, sometime the drawer opening or the floor if he also had a too-big-for-the-drawer pee that morning. In other words, a nasty mess.We also have difficulty rolling the box without spilling litter everywhere because it has to be filled so high.On the plus side, this box works great for our normal cat, and for those that care, it is made in Canada by what appears to be a small business.Three stars for working OK for normal kitty."
114187,0,"Good value for the price, dont expect a soft and plushie bed, it is more like a sheepskin, not very thick, but my dog likes it and that is what matters. I really like that I can throw the whole thing in the washing machine."
12147,1,"These treats are definitely my dogs' favorite. They gobble these up and have started turning down other treats. They come in fun shapes and when you open them up, they smell just like peanut butter. They smell so good, I've been tempted to try them. The ingredients are wholesome and natural and I feel good about giving these to my dogs. I just wish more came in a box."
205724,0,"The product is plastic, you can call it vinyl if you want, but to me, it's plastic. I have a built in pet door on my storm door with a heavy soft vinyl flap and my dogs loved it from day one, several years ago and the flap is still in perfect condition. I built this on a frame for my patio door and my dogs won't use it. The solid plastic two piece door bangs when I make them go through it and they won't use it on their own. The screws are designed for a 3"" thick frame so anything less than that needs to have the screws cut down or buy new ones. This information is at the end of the directions. Nice time to find out. My dogs run through the storm door pet door and this one they struggle to go through and it's actually larger than the built in one. I will not buy a hard plastic flap door again. The panel you insert to close the door is also hard plastic which feels like it would crack in a minute if it got hit too hard. Overall, I am not impressed with this product's quality for the money. I have three large dogs and I think if they try to run through this door they will break the flap, that's if they ever start using it."
187414,2,"This crate looked nice and set up easily when i received it, but it didn't last long. I have a mid sized dog, a wheaton terrior, with a strong will. She broke the crate within 2 weeks, She scratched and scratched at the bars next to the door, some of the metal bars started to fall off. She broke out of the crate one day!!! The crate I had previously lasted 6 years and it was still strong, but the bars were starting to get rusted and the plastic tray at the bottom was cracked, so I bought this new crate. Now I wish I had kept the old one."
62026,2,"We've been using Advantix for a long time and it works great BUT recently we had an emergency with our small dog.I came home to find her eyes swollen shut. We'd done nothing out of the ordinary except apply her latest dose of Advantix the night before. We thought perhaps she had rubbed some on her bed and then gotten it in her eyes. While my wife ran the dog to the vet, I called the emergency help number for Advantix to see what they recommend should this be the case. After describing the situation to the Advantix representative, he told me in a most condesending tone that it sounded like ""an interesting theory"". After repeating that I was just interested in finding out what we should just in case, he again refused to give me any sort of advice and instead implied I was lying. He sarcastically informed me that ""it's not like there's an antidote"". Eventually I just hung up.I'm not sure why there is an emergency help number listed if Advantix is not planning on giving any help, but for all the other pet owners out there--don't bother calling and don't bother buying!"

164198,1,"A stray cat adopted us after surviving last winter outside and on her own. She would never alllow us to get within 100 yards, until one day decided we were ""OK"". What a sweet animal. But a cat and inside the house is not an option, so we got this pad and placed it inside a wooden cat carrier in the garage. She loves being on this pad, and now we know where to find her. We have many coyotes so keeping her wandering to a minimum was a good thing. Great idea, great product so far - had it about 3 months now."
11769,2,"I wanted to get an automatic cat feeder so that my cat wouldn't wake me up at 5 am, and also so that she could eat more regularly scheduled meals and lose weight. I really liked the idea of this since you get to pick the portion size, and I didn't have any problems with her trying to get to the next meal early. The problem I had was that the timer on this thing is totally off. Sometimes it worked fine, and other times it wouldn't feed her until hours after it was supposed to. Sometimes I wasn't home when it was scheduled to feed her, so I had no idea that she hadn't been fed until I heard it turning hours later. I couldn't count on this to work properly, so I returned it and switched to the Crown Majestic. It was a little more expensive, but far more reliable."

202275,0,Only problem it takes the patience of Job to get a cat or a dog to submit to this thing. It takes forever to remove dead hair and my recommendation is to take your pet to a good groomer and let them do in an hour what it would take days to do IF your pet would quietly submit to it.
161441,0,"we do not use that plastic container, it's a nuisance. Bags are leak proof and big enough -- they do their job; but they are hard to separate from the roll and then hard to open, doh..."
58231,0,"This toy has a failing if you have a dog who's too clever for it's own good. The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray."

47765,0,"It looks great in my backyard. The birds like it, also. I like the feeder because it holds a good amount of seed. One of the feeders has a deep split in the wood on the corner already. It would be really helpful to have a slight raise in the middle of the floor of the feeder. The seed seems to stay in the middle and the birds can't reach it when it gets low. There is still a good amount of seed in the feeder at that time."
133650,0,"This is a good product. Other than making my dogs hair shiny and healthy, it also eliminates dog body odor as well as fecal odor. Normally, my bullmastiff smells after 4-5 days after her bath,I noticed that with this product, even after 2 weeks from bath, she still doesn't smell dog.. Great product however, upon my reorder, when I received the product, it is already less 20% since the smelly salmon oil leaked. I hope the shipper will be more careful in packing this item next time to avoid spillage and loss."
59134,1,Fast shipping!Received as advertised and works great!Comes with reminder stickers that are great to put on calendar. Will definitely purchase again.
98228,1,For the price you pay for 500 feet you pay for 50 feet elsewhere. This is quality air line hose that is durable enough to manipulate with out collapse. We run several air pumps for plankton growing and I was tired of spending $10 for 25 feet of air line. This is a great price for a bulk amount of air line.

There are few strands of rope removed, but overall this has lasted longer than any toy we have purchased, even the black Kong is no match for him. Zeus and I both love this toy so much that I just ordered a second for when this one finally dies."
82255,0,"I have a 4 1/2lb maltese puppy. The coat fits her very well, but sometimes she pulls up one of her front legs and it gets stuck in the coat. Then she falls on her cute little face. It's kind of amusing when it happens on the grass, but I do have to carry her up and down the stairs for obvious reasons. If your dog is not active than this is a great coat. Or maybe if it is overly active and you would like to slow it down. I'm personally going to go buy something else before I have to go buy another dog."
125397,0,"My Dog loved it so much, he chewed it up in a week.I just wish it would last longer"
106907,2,"This item is widely marketed as ""non-toxic"" and safe for kids and pets. So I bought a bunch of it to spread around my very swampy lawn. But when I read the instructions, they were filled with warnings to contact poison control if swallowed and to wash thoroughly if the product touches your skin! So maybe this really is non-toxic and the company is just trying to protect itself from liability. Or maybe it really is unsafe. In either event, I can't take the chance with my two-year-olds running around my yard."
172560,1,"If there's one thing I hate about trying to dress my large breed dogs, it's that sizing charts are always WAY off. I did my research on size and the XXL was way too big for a very tall labradoodle. But the quality is quite good."
22565,1,"I was pretty dubious when I got this as a retirement gift for my boss. She absolutely loved it (she meaning the cat and her human). I got one for myself and discovered the long hair cat is not too wild about the Furminator, but the short hair one likes it a lot. I also get a lot more fur off of the short hair cat with the Furminator. I suspect the long hair has such long fine overcoat hair that it simply doesn't reach the undercoat. The amount of fur I got off the short hair is amazing. And the difference it makes in how often I have to vacuum is wonderful!"
137298,0,This turned out to be completely opposite of what I thought. It is a nice dog costume but the dogs have to wear it in the front not on their backs and its very hard to keep on a hyper dog!

51844,0,"Bought two of these for my rats (I have a male cage and a female cage) because they like to climb. Ladders got here 2 days early which was very pleasing. Packaging was great and they were not at all damaged. My only complaint is I had the worst time with attaching them to the cage bars. They went right on but the latches at the top are open enough where if weight is applied to them, they move around and can even come all the way off. Not very sturdy but if you have a smaller pet they might work for ya. I ended up having to use bread ties to hold them still. I love how they look in my cages and have no other complaints. Very durable. :) Just watch out using them with larger pets! But well worth the price."
73097,0,"My dog certainly loved these, but they do not go well in the Kong like they are advertised. They just broke into small peices when I tried putting them in, and my dog could not get the small peices out. I would recommend getting the Ziggies to put into the Kong toy intead."
179248,0,"I bought two of the 48 ounce size feeders so I wouldnt have to fill it every day. One of the feeders leaked around the bottom right from the start. The other one started leaking after about a month's use. I fixed it myself by applying gutter sealant around the bottom and letting it dry. However for the price of these feeders, it should have better quality. I do like the size of it. However, I cant say these are exactly easy to clean either. I have a couple of First Nature feeders that are great, and easy to clean, but the largest size is a quart."
125382,2,"Purchased this toy for our small 6 pound Yorkie. Within 15 minutes of play, the stuffing was coming out of the beak and the seam had completely opened on the underside. Very poor quality for a dog's toy."

66114,0,"This tag came quickly and was packed just fine. My dog's name and my name were equal size, so I felt that people would think his name was my name. In the photo it looks like the second line is smaller, but mine wasn't. So I wrote his name with a magic marker on the other side on the white coating stuff and put tape over it. My last tag broke apart. On my last tag the writing scraped off. Neither of those things will happen with this tag. And it's light. So it turned out just fine once I did my thing."

42513,0,"I've had this filter for about 2 weeks. I used it first in a ""Lee's habitat"", which was a disaster because the current is too strong for that little amount of water (it's a large plastic habitat with a raised part, which can be used as a home for reptiles, -terrarium- amphibians -rain forest- or aquatic turtles - about 3 gal of water space with a asking platform) So no, in 3 gallons of water the filter creates too much of a current. I'd have to turn it off while they ate because they would get knocked around otherwise :(I now have it in a 10gal aquarium, and it seems to work alright.My only concern is that it only filters out debris. Like other reviews stated; there is just a sponge in there, which is pretty ""coarse"" and stuff can get past it easily, in which case it would just get ""spit back out"".. It doesn't filter ammonia or small pieces of debris etc (turtles are very messy eaters and their food, if left uneaten, disintegrates and lies on the bottom to rot.) It has only been a few days in the 10 gal tank, but I assume I will still have to dump out, clean the aquarium by hand, and replace the water at least once a week...I am looking into an ammonia filter, or at least something that has a carbon filter in there... something more than a simple sponge that catches only half of the debris.."

93398,0,"We got this collar at the suggestion of our vet. Our 11 year old dog was a pound puppy with multiple issues (abuse) when we got him 10 years ago. He's a fear aggressor and his behavior has not improved with age. After checking for a health issue (there were none) the vet suggested this collar might help a little. We haven't seen a dramatic change and if something sets him off, he is still a wild man.At the suggestion of a different reviewer, we have also tried a collar from Nurturecalm that has a higher percentage of hormone in it. That hasn't made a big difference either. These collars may help with conditions like separation anxiety, but it is not effective with our dog for his issues. I must note however that he did not react to gunshots in the distance the other day. In the past if he heard gunshots or fireworks when we were on a walk he would immediately want to go back to the car and he would be shaking. That was not the case the other day. So, it may help some conditions but it is not able to work miracles. For those of you whose dog is not too ""wounded"" I would say it is worth a try."

120970,0,"When we first bought it we didn't have to change the water for a month. One thing though is you will have to put a partition around it so your fish won't keep on banging it. This filter is very quiet that you won't hear a sound. One day my fish kept banging it that it swam sideways. We needed to give it medicine. It took 7 days for my fish to feel better. This filter only fits for a 10 gallon. When we put it in a 2 gallon it was grabing the fish. If you put it in a 2 gallon put a partition around it. The water is very clear. I would say if you get this item, put a partition around it."
209034,1,"Adopted a cat from the pound and brought her home. Personnel told me that the last place she lived she didn't use her litter box. I bought this booda dome, and had little worry it would work, because it just looks private. She took to it like magic without an accident. It has been 2 weeks now and she has been very busy in there. No litter stones make it out. No foul smells beyond normal. The filter is a cute addition and helps with the smell but the basics are here 200% (privacy, contained litter box, no mess for her to step out, easy access), that I recommend this absolutely to anyone."
166984,2,"I ordered these stairs and were shipped to me only covered in heavy plastic. When I opened the top of the package, the top stair was cracked and several pieces were broken off. I did not open the rest of the package, since I was returning it immediately.I taped the top of the package and returned it to a UPS store. They could not believe that this product had no packing protection. It was easy to see how the damage occurred. I did get my refund, but I was extremely dissatisfied with this company that couldn't spend additional money to make sure that their product would arrive in its intended quality."

101798,2,These bags are very hard to use separating the folds of the top and opening them to do their job is difficult.

196305,0,"We have smaller Marineland tanks that have much better designs. Honestly, I was quite disappointed in the hood design. The hood is not hinged and is a complete pain to move around for water changes & such. The feeding opening came broken (the little pegs that hold it in place are so tiny that they must just snap off) it is farther back on the tank & very hard to navigate if the tank is raised.Boo hiss!"
40138,0,this litter box doesn't work exactly like i'd hoped it would. for some reason i am finding that when i roll it the litter itself goes into the little tray but the waste stays in the main part. other than that it's okay.
172487,0,Put grocery bags or small trash bag around the liner. That way you are able to reuse the liner and get your monies worth from them. I have tried this method and am real pleased. If you are creative you won't have to remove the liner and take the chances of breaking the liner. Even with the liner being broken it will still work.
189723,1,"I purchased Wee Wee Housebreaking pads for my older dog who occasionally has accidents.

88079,1,"This was bought as a replacement fountain for the older model Drinkwell Pet Fountain. Out last fountain worked just fine, but after 6 years had gotten too grimy for us. I wanted something that looked cleaner and held more water. The new Platinum is great! It is quieter than our old one, and seems to hold a LOT more water as well. My cats have always liked the fountain, and this is a great way to keep their water fresh for days/weeks on end. Every so often I do have to add more water, and like that it is dishwasher safe. We will likely be Drinkwell customers for life!"
204684,0,"This kennel is very nice looking and provides a lot of ventalation but lacks quality workmanship and materials. The clips that hold the top and bottom together would not stay latched. I also would not carry this kennel by the handle if there was an animal inside no matter how much they weighed. I just wouldn't trust the cheap latches to stay closed.In addition, the Amazon web site description states this kennel would fit an animal up to 15 inches tall by 23 inches long but the manufactures tag on the kennel itself stated it would only fit an animal up to 12 inches tall and 21 inches long. Now, I don't know where they get those guidelines from but my dog, who is 15 inches tall, seemed to have plenty of room and if it had not been for the problem with the latches I would have definately kept this purchace."

When the dog tents came, the instructions tell you to put the blanket inside. WHERE IS THE BLANKET? I think they offer this price because it is incomplete.

Hes wearing it everyday now since its winter and it doesn't bother him at all. Great product. If you have a dog that is on the borderline of size, I would suggest getting the smaller size though."
108515,0,"I have a 70 lb dog and two cats. Not only can I use it to keep them off of the furniture, but I can lie it across a doorway to keep them in a particular room while still keeping an eye on them. For the first few weeks I had it on the low setting. This setting worked relatively well for the cats(if they stepped on it, they would jump high into the air and learn to not go in that area), but it was mildly ineffective for my dog. So I decided to set it on high. It worked great to keep the dog at bay, but then both of the cats managed to jump on it at the same time. I don't know how magnets or electricity works, but as soon as they both went on the scat-mat, they exploded. Not as in having a burst of energy, I mean I spent the next day and a half wiping the cat remnants that were painted all over the walls. Now, my wife was away for the weekend and I know she wouldn't believe what happened to the cats, so I picked up 5 cats from the local animal shelter. When she got home I told her what happened, and of course, she thought I was joking. That's when I picked up the box of cats and dumped them onto the scat-mat. Kaboom. Not only were the walls covered in cat, but my wife was too close when it happened and now permanently lost sight in one of her eyes and has to draw her eyebrows on. Despite these unforeseen problems in the fundamental science of the scat mat, I would still recommend this product. All in all, a 3 out of 5."
125740,2,"The diffuser comes as two pieces that are joined together. When I installed it, one side had plenty of bubbles, but the other side seemed to not work at all. I tried using a needle to punch holes in the non-bubbling side as suggested in the instructions, but then that side produced large bubbles and the other side seemed to produce almost no bubbles. I was using a more than adequate air pump with variable output, so it wasn't the pump causing problems.It seems the pores in the two pieces weren't matched in size, so you get uneven output."
7765,1,"We have a top entry litter box with lid. These liners fit perfectly. I wish they didn't have folds on the inside bottom that trap litter, but that may be a manufacturing limitation. Maybe they could make the folds on the outside?"

I bought it in hopes that she would sleep in it instead of trying to sleep on my bed. She seems to prefer the floor or rocking chair to this bed which she only uses for only small part of the night. Considering returning it."
167474,0,"I bought this for my Mini Lop because I thought it was a cute idea and would look cool in the cage. Yes it is fun to hang on the cage or leave standing up but it is really hard to fill it. Every time I try to fill the hay it gets everywhere. I finally gave up and this holder has been sitting next to the cage for about 2 months. If you don't mind making a mess while filling it and having a hard time closing the door when it's filled, than definitely buy one because your bunny will like rolling the ball around while eating the hay."
170113,2,"Our German Shepherd is not one to destroy toys. He loves squeakers and mostly only plays fetch. However, the main squeaker of this toy broke within 2 days. The little squeaker, on the foot, still works fine. But the main one still collapses and expands...without any noise."
131886,2,"The product I got was not what was pictured, and when I double checked the description, I realized that that was confusing as well.What I got was rolls of rawhide in a simple, straight stick shape. It also was not ""compressed"" like the type of bones pictured are. I wanted my dog to not be able to tear off pieces like is so easy to do with the loosely rolled knot bones. When she chewed down on this for a while and got to the inner layers, the inner layers just fell apart, leaving us with lots of small strips of rawhide, which I was afraid could easily be choked on.Bottom line: it's not compressed and it's not bone shaped, so I think the picture and description is misleading, and it was not what I was looking for."
68424,2,"I bought the toothpaste and there were some weird green fibers in there. My dog sniffed at it and turned his head away.

They did send a pick-up for lab test but later never returned my phone call when I asked for the result (I called many times. When I called this company no one ever answers the phone.

My biggest fear when out hiking in the middle of nowhere is infection from cuts and scrapes. No doctors, no clinic, only whatever you have in your first aid kit, and if there's a way to quickly deal with a problem without major worry of infection, there's simply no excuse to not be prepared."

In all total from order to delivery it took 17 days to receive my order!!! Had I know that I would have either ordered MUCH earlier or not at all! The final complaint is that this does not qualify for free shipping even thought the cost is over 25 dollars. Maybe again because it is an affliated company or due to the weight. This too made my wait and the costs to wait less appealing."

188812,0,"If you fill this feeder more than half, I found that the suction cups provided would fail. (Yes, I thoroughly cleaned the glass before attaching the suction cups, and a wiped the cups with a damp paper towel, let them dry, and the pressed down hard to enforce a thorough mating of the suction cups with the glass surface. It stayed up for about 90 minutes.) The suction cups seem fine -- about as good quality as you could hope to find. It is simply poorly designed because their surface area is too small to handle the weight load of a full feeder. The thing works well if you keep the feeder half-full. (In case you are wondering, I filled it with low-waste bird-feeder food which includes the usual mix of millet and seeds -- nothing containing especially heavy food pellets.)My solution for now is to keep it half-full or less, but I'm thinking about replacing the suction cups with screws, to hang it off of a wood surface. However, by doing so it will the visiting birds will be less visible than when placed on a window."

Needless to say, he is very high-energy and does best when given a job to do that involves chewing.He LOVES his Novabone and Nylabone- but tears thru the larger sizes in a single afternoon- so when I saw this I was very happy, because it is an unusual shape and durable! Amazon's iphone app let you scan in an item and find it cheaper on Amazon- so instead of the higher pet shop price, I scored a savings deal on Amazon! Nice!My big, fat, sad complaint is that you cannot CHOOSE the dinosaur! I knew this when ordering and the stegosaurus arrived- honestly I was hoping for the T-Rex or the Brontosaurus but I guess you get what you get. Still, a beagle gnawing on a T-Rex would be pretty funny..."
170009,2,"I used this product on my cat in October. I should have noticed she was immediately uncomfortable, but I was naive and trusted the ""natural"" claims on this product. A few days later her fur came off and her skin appeared burnt. She then became lethargic, stopped eating, and couldn't use the bathroom. I took her to the vet and she died a day later. This happened within 3 weeks of using the product. I blame myself for being naive, and have been back and forth with the SENTRY company - they are taking NO responsibility. DO NOT use this product!! See a vet for a flea/tick medicine."

153123,0,"I've had my CatGeni around 3 years and I LOVED IT, at first. It worked when I firstgot it, but it wasn't long before the trouble started. It didn't take long for mycats to start using it. It's really loud, so when I first heard it I thought thatthere was no way they would ever use it. I put the CatGeni in my bathroom next tothe litter box and then all I had to do was not change the litter and it took lessthan a week for them to start using it. I started having problems with my CatGeniprobably after a few weeks, it's hard to say for sure since it was so long ago.The hair and poo would stop up the hopper and that is a REALLY NASTY, not tomention, time consuming job to fix that problem. Then hair and poo would get stuckin the hose. Of course when the beeping goes off to let you know there's aproblem you don't know which problem it is, there are so many! Oh Yeah, back to the hair inthe hose, the first few customer care helped me with this problem, they had me takethe unit apart and take the hose off of my toilet and put in my bathtub and run waterin the hose in hopes that the water would push the hair/poo ball back into the unit.We also tried water from the unit through the hose to the tub. Luckily, at some pointI talked to someone at customer care, when I had a hair/poo ball in my hose, that toldme to just shake and bang/slam the hose around (while the hose is ""still in my toilet"").That trick has saved me a lot of ""Nasty Time"".I have also had the arm that attaches to the scoop ""go out"". This problem is detectedwhenever your scoop is supposed to shake the beads out, it makes this unbelievablydeafening banging noise!I could live with most of the problems I have had, beads all over my house, unitsirreversible broken (I've had probably 6 or more), ect.. The problems I just couldn'tlive with were the clogged hopper and the clogged hose!The true flaw with the CatGeni is that the hole in the hopper and the hose are toosmall!! If you have more than one cat and they poo and later you flush, it won't go through.The poo is hard and, of couse, is full of hair and the hopper and the hose are toosmall! ALSO, the notch that holds the hose at the bottom of the base is too small.I just recently found this out since the notch cause a cut in my hose. I thought the catswere peeing outside the CatGeni in front of my toilet, but I finally realized I had a cutin my hose. I also have trouble with the connection where the CatGeni connects withmy toilet to the water source, it always leaks.Some of my cats got to where they wouldn't use the CatGeni if it had been used a fewtimes, admittedly I think it was my older girls, so I had to put the litter box backin the bathroom. I now have my toilet, the kitty toilet, and the litter box, not to mentionmy tub/shower and 2 sinks! Oh, I finally solved the the clogging problem. I JUST SCOOP THEPOO OUT OF MY CATGENI AND FLUSH IT!! Oh Yeah, it also would clog if your cats had""soft poo""My cats prefer the litter box, but they like to have the CatGeni for an alternativechoice."
77486,0,My 14 week old Yorkie loved this thing! He would sit and chew on it for hours. After about a week he had broke through and started to get one of the corners off so I had to take it away.Also.. I got it at target for under 4 bucks. Target has the best prices for dog toys I have found.

65276,1,My dogs bark at me every morning until they get their Greenie treat. They are addicted to them. I have 3 dogs so it is a bit pricey but that is why I order from Amazon so that I can keep up with their addiction! We use two different sizes of Greenies and the teenie size is good but then they want more than one. If I give them the size larger then I can get away with only one treat per day. I do not know what they put in these but my dogs are crazy for them.
108814,1,"For my beagle, this leash length works well for letting her explore during walks, but it isn't so long that I can't maintain good control. I considered a 15 foot leash, but am glad I went with the 10 foot length. The construction is solid. I have been using this leash daily for over a month now with no complaint. It gets dragged on the ground and through brambles, and hasn't shown any signs of wear yet. I expect to get over a year of twice daily use out of it. If you have a dog that doesn't have to explore EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE, the leash will last a long time."
116694,1,"We have two cats and wash them on a fairly regular basis due to allergies. This shampoo has done the trick, it has a pleasant but no overpowering smell, you get quite a bit for the cost and gets your pets smelling fresh and clean. The bottle features a picture of a dog, but the product itself (at least from what I could gather) only specified small pets as the target demographic. The positive reviews that this product received for dogs can easily be echoed for cats."

161938,2,"Nasty stuff for the humans (sticky gooey mess at the point where clumps form against the sides of the box), and doesn't attract my cats in any way. One cat ALWAYS uses his litter, so he continues using this too, but the odd thing was that he ALWAYS just cannot WAIT to make his mark in every freshly changed litter box and yet he was COMPLETELY UNINTERESTED in marking this new litter, until later that night when it was time for him to ""go"". The PROBLEM cat, on the other hand, didn't use this litter ANY more than he'd been using the old litter. Makes ya wonder whether the glowing reviews come from the company's stockholders."

55207,0,"Cat Food Distributer Ball Multivet SlimCat / B0006TQU36My cats are 6 years old and still pretty frisky, but seem to be constantly bored. I bought this to spice up feeding time, but they were not even remotely interested in the ball. I rolled it around so that some of the food shook out, and they seemed to understand the concept, but weren't really interested in hunting for their dinner, when they're so used to eating from their bowls. I kept it around for a few days and tried to engage their interest a few more times, but they never seemed to care and I wasn't going to withhold food from them just to get them to play with the toy. I gave up and gave the ball to a friend of mine, whose cat has eating issues, and figured that maybe they could make it work.Overall, the ball isn't a bad piece of equipment - I've filled enough doggie treat balls to figure this one out quickly enough, but I will say that the plastic feels a little cheap and flimsy, and I can imagine this breaking if it wore played with too roughly. It's a decent sized ball for treats or for a snack, but larger cats will probably want more than a single serving. If you have a kitten, I'd say this might be a fun investment, but older cats may not take to the concept.~ Ana Mardoll"
1580,0,I love this because my dog (lab) can't destroy it. Its nice to hide the treats in it. I do not like the outside ridges because they are super messy to load up and clean. My dog was not really into licking the stuffing out so it was just rolling around making a mess. We basically just use it as a heavy duty ball now and sometimes hide treats in the middle part
100199,2,"My pup loved it while it lasted, but I wish this was made of harder materiel. The squeaker was a little annoying but funny. This toy lasted about 2 hours and was torn apart, one of the balls was in 1/2. Careful to watch your dog as this could become a choking hazard"
142849,2,"And I was stupid enough to buy TWO of them. Tried to email company & that was next to impossible.I bought one Mega and two Elites. I would just as soon frisbee the two Elites down the street, they were so ridiculously hard to assemble. And who on earth ever heard of requiring ASSEMBLY for a freakin a cat box???The Mega popped right out of the box and was ready for operation immediately. The ELITES, however, required ASSEMBLY. I spent 45 minutes tonight, a Saturday night, assembling these #&@&@##$~!~ things. UNCALLED for. And WAY too expensive for the TIME and TROUBLE they have cost.

This is just an aid, not a miracle!"
197867,0,"My dog has had several of these balls and loves them. We've renamed them Crack Balls because he is addicted to them. The only thing is that he can chew through them fairly quickly. I think that they've started to make them with thinner plastic, so they don't last very long. It's kind of disappointing because I love watching him play with it, but I can't justify the price when they only last a day or so."

36909,0,I've seen these balls on T.V. before and it was recommended to me by a family member as weel. I have a border collie puppy (now 6 months old) but at the time I got it he was about two and a half. This product isn't really puppy friendly as he had no interest in it because it didn't give him instant gratification of a treat no matter how many times he rolled it. As other reviewers have said it also isn't for heavy chewers (but we should all know not to leave dogs unattended with their toys). My roommate's LARGE dog got ahold of this toy and tore it to pieces. I would like to try it on my BC now that he's older but it's a bit pricey to 'test it out' again. I will try something else in it's place.

29419,1,"I was really concerned. My 15 year old medium size border collie was not doing well.. she couldn't get up on her own because of her back hips, was developing bald spots, her desire to eat diminished and she lost a lot of weight.. she was having serious problems with her poops - had even thrown up quite a bit. I was really distraught. She is too big to be carried and we have a baby.I am a dog walker and a customer was using NuPro Gold so I thought, why not check it out.. The change has been remarkable.. She is so full of life.. looks for her food, her coat looks AMAZING and she has been a happier pup. I am forever grateful for relief it has given her and so happy to see her enjoying life again."
151484,0,"There is some glitch that makes it trigger all the time, so it goes through batteries too quickly, and we also can't tell whether the cat has triggered it... but the one time he jumped up, it certainly worked. We had it on medium, and that was enough to send him cowering to the bedroom looking for comfort... a little harsh, but I'm an RN and can't have cat bottoms on the table... would be 5 stars if it worked properly."

This one is alot easier than the others, I feel like he took 2 seconds to get all the bees out of the hive. He loved sticking his snout into the holes andjust walking around like that, LOL. I wish it was stronger, but for what I paid for it he got his use out of it."
165552,0,"I recently bought and installed a 3/4W Aqualight LED to add a moonlight effect at night. I had to buy a second timer. My first runs the regular lights from 6:30am to 8:00pm. The Aqualight LED goes on at 8:30pm and off at 11:30pm.As others have found, it is not easy to install on the hood if you don't want to drill through the hood to attach it. I solved it by buying some two sided adhesive velcro tape. I attached a small square of it to the hood and one small square to the LED and this way I was able to attach it exactly where I wanted it placed. This stuff is available in any hardware store.The light provides a cone of light that covers about 30% of the bottom of a 30G tank. It doesn't by any means cover the entire tank and I would only recommend it as a starter kit for those who are thinking of adding some night light."

27086,0,"The bowl part of this product is a soft plastic that runs alongside and underneath one side of the water bottle. You pull it off and away from the bottle, and it forms a little boat; open the water bottle nozzle and squeeze the bottle and water pours out into the little boat/bowl. My dog uses it without any problem, and I can keep squeezing to refill as she drinks. Once she's finished, I slip the bowl back into its original position. Easy enough, but takes both hands to accomplish. Twice I have not gotten the lid correctly onto the bottle - leaked all over my front seat once, and the other time, the bottle slipped away from the lid, causing me to lose all the water on the walking trail. But that could simply be operator error. A good product that does what it is intended to do."
162228,1,This is a fun chew toy and my terriers enjoy the product. My only reason for not giving it a full five stars is that it is not widely distributed which makes it hard to find the replacement chew rings or to replace the toy when the ends get chewed down.
53159,0,"Maybe it's just me, but as soon as I went to pinch the s-hook hanger provided with the feeder together, the glass eye the feeder is supposed to hang by broke. It would have been better to provide some sort of ring already in through the hole so pinching the s-hook together wouldn't cause the feeder to break.Well, now it's hanging by a makeshift cord &quot;holder&quot; I created. I gave the product 3 stars because it is easy to fill, easy to clean, and the hummingbirds in my yard had no problems switching from my UV weakened bottle-feeder to this feeder. I deducted one star because my birds seem to like a perch and this feeder doesn't have one, and one star for not providing a hanger already in the glass eye that the feeder hangs from. Hey guys, guess what! Glass is fragile, I'm an idiot, make it idiot-proof!"

Nope. I'm tellin' ya, dumb. as. a. rock.So anyway, I gave it an average grade ... it did what it was supposed to.

Neither of the replacement devices worked, as it was impossible to pair the transmitter with the receiver -- even after PetSafe corrected their additional error of sending me the wrong remote control transmitter the first time.I now have three non-functioning collar sets (plus a very nice remote control for another device that I don't have), I am down the original purchase price, a $42.50 warranty service charge, forwarded mail cost x 2, and a lot of wasted time for me and my friend in the US.PetSafe offered nothing to compensate."

151505,0,"There is not much to say about this other than it works with the regular mats. The design could have been better in how the 2 sections fit together, but outside of that it does what it's intended to do. The 2 sections will lie side by side or lengthwise, but you could probably have one on a chair, and one on the floor below it because the extension is long enough for that. So for 1/2 the cost of a regular mat this turns my one scat mat into 2 scat mats.I only gave it 3 stars because for the most part, these mats work sporadically and their usefulness really depends on where you put them. On the floor they are about useless as pets can easily jump over them in most locations. At least with me, my cat is always testing them to see if I turned them on or not---this tells me that she is not learning where not to go, even though I consistently tell her NO when she's attempting to go where not allowed. Instead, she is reacting to what is in her path at the time. If it isn't there, she will be back. Not all that helpful.That said, the places it does work are: on the dining table, on the beds, on the kitchen counters, on the back of a chair close to the window, on the sofa during the early morning to stop her from rough playing on it during that time."

These perches are very smooth plastic, so you might want to have a rough perch in the cage to wear down nails. She is a bare-eyed cockatoo so she is smaller than most cockatoo species, but she doesn't seem to have a problem staying on the medium size perch. In fact the medium sized one is her favorite. She doesn't slip or slide on it and it gives her much needed warmth during the chilly days.The cord is wrapped with tightly coiled steel, if your bird is a chewer you might want to supervise or put a plastic wire protector around the cord. The cord is somewhat kept out of reach of the bird, but not as far as the description leads you to believe. Luckily my bird isn't a chewer or else I might be worried. The steel might not be enough to keep a determined bird from chewing through the cord, but again you can purchase a plastic cord protector to wrap around the steel for added protection.My 'too is reluctant to embrace anything new, especially perches. I took her out of her cage while I installed it, and then put her back in her cage and backed her up to the perch. When she turned around it was right there and I just put her onto it before she could protest. Now she doesn't leave it!Love this product, recommend it to anyone!"

5472,1,I bought Angel Eyes for my Shih Tzu/Mini-Poodle Mix. It started working immediately. She no longer has any stains on her hair by her eyes. She loves the taste (I bought beef flavored). Would highly recommend it.
161144,0,"I bought two of these in different styles and they each arrived the same day and they each kept our 5 cats entertained for about 2 days. Then, they went back to their catnip filled, faux, furry mice and the mylar tinsel balls and the plastic balls with bells in them. The Turbos' now sit collecting dust and once in a while Dinkie, the Maine Coon/Tabby mix, will put a big paw under the ball and flip it out of the track and chase it :)"

67070,0,"This little raincoat is adorable, fits my dog perfectly, and is firm, (so it won't blow up in windy weather,) BUT I just got it and it REEKS of moth balls!!! The smell is so bad, we had to put the box it came in outside. If I can't get the smell out of the raincoat I am going to return it. I've washed it twice and am letting it air dry but it still reeks. The smell is so strong that it's giving me a terrible headache!"
200439,0,"This product is great for shedding dogs and cats but does not work well for specific breeds of dogs. I have a Siberian Husky who sheds his undercoat like crazy in the warm weather months. This brush barely got through his thick, artic breed type outer coat hairs to reach those pesky undercoat hairs. Works well on soft, long haired breeds like Goldens and Collies, etc. Definately not for Artic breeds!! Stick to your typical undercoat rake and a shedding blade for them."
9303,0,I bought this pet door to install on my screened in patio. This is the third one I have put in. The other two broke when my cat just busted thru them. My fault.... I had left them locked when he wanted to use it. For me this is a good feature as he doesn't break it unless he is really in distress.I have to trim some of the inside material from the outer section so it will fit the thin metal below the screen. If anyone knows of a pet door designed for this purpose please let me know.The product arrived in a timely manner and as advertised.
195087,0,"This is a very nice quality birdhouse with a clever design. Unfortuantely it arrived broken. The box was much larger than the birdhouse and the only padding used was crumpled up brown paper. It appears the birdhouse moved around in transit because a large piece of wood chipped off the roof. I don't have time to return it, and I don't particularly want to deal with the hassle either, so I'm going to get soem wood glue and try to repair it myself. I'm giving this 3 stars, but more accurately I'd give the product 5 stars and the packaging 1 star."

153850,2,"Be careful when testing - the one I received must have been painfully defective. I selected the mode where it'll make a sound that people can hear as well, and the sound was so very loud as to be painful to people. Seriously, 18 hours later and my ear which was closest to it when I tested still hurts and feels like it has cotton stuffed into it. The ultrasonic-only mode made everyone in the house complain too. Clearly the unit was broken, but if you buy this device, use it cautiously at first. I returned it and I don't plan to buy another."
89013,0,"The actual water feeder is rounder, but more apealing than the one in the picture.What i didn't like about it is that it's a hastle to snap the lid onn and if you don't snap tightly, it will not work. The water will spill and the system will fail.I'm just glad that i'll have to deal with that only once a week or so. Hopefully i don't break it after 2-3 uses just trying to put the lid on."

63186,1,"We like the Wiggler. I just bought our second one. The first did very well until some crows decided to knock it over a half dozen times. As the instructions say, turning it upside down can ruin it. The crows succeeded in drowning the Wiggler. For the first couple of years we just used it normally. We did add the pottery cover just for looks and the cover is heavy enough to help keep the unit upright. For about a year we started adding Fountec algaecide / clarifier to keep the birdbath cleaner. The new unit we just got has improvements over the older one. The three legs are heavier gauge and have ""footings"" that should help it to stay upright when the crows attack. It even came with two extra sets of floats and an extra screw. I like that they improved the legs and provided spare parts. After a few years, the floats could use changing to keep them working properly, and anything that helps defeat those stupid crows in appreciated. I may have to get my pellet gun out just in case.I do recommend this product and a good pellet gun too:)"
33004,0,We bought this fountain to encourage one of our cats with kidney disease to drink more water. The product worked great with routine maintenance and our 3 cats absolutely loved it. Unfortunately today the motor stopped running for some reason. Will try to get it replaced by the manufacturer as it is still within the 1 year warranty period. Hopefully the replacement process won't take long.
182942,2,"I got one of these in November of 2003 because I had some extra money and thought it might make things easier for me. I have a rather large cat. He isn't freakishly large, but people usually react to his size. He's bigger than most cats. As a result his uhhh...&amp;quot;output&amp;quot; is higher than most other cats. I bring this up because the volume of waste that goes into this thing seems to affect how well it works. I ran into some trouble with this thing and I'm actually thinking of just going back to a regular old litterbox.One of the big problems I ran into was with the time it waited after your cat &amp;quot;goes&amp;quot; to clean stuff up. It almost seems like it wasn't long enough for my cat. The problem is it wouldn't wait long enough for the urine to harden the litter. As a result, the rake thing would just kind of dig into the semi-hard litter and get stuck on it. Of course this means it didn't get deposited into the box at the end and just kind of crusted onto the rakes. The other major problem was with the rakes themselves or the box or something. I could never quite figure it out. What would happen nearly every time the rakes would make their final approach to the waste recepticle, they would get stuck on some kind of small protrusion (could never find it) on the ege of the box just before the recepticle. As a result, it would get stuck for a few seconds, then become unstuck, releasing the momentum it had from being stuck and flinging poo and litter sometimes as high as a foot in the air. Not fun to clean up.All-in-all I'd say only get this if you have a small cat and some damn good litter. In my opinion however, a 10 dollar litterbox with a good old fashioned handscoop and box-liners would do just as well. Thanks."
217109,1,"I bought this based on some reviews I read and thought it would be the most nutritious for first new baby that I was handfeeding with a syringe. It mixes quickly and thickens a bit on standing, so you have to use it quickly or add a little more warm water as you go. It worked well and the baby adjusted to it quickly and grew well. One problem seems to be that there are a lot of hard little clumps that get stuck in the syringe. You have to be careful not to put too much pressure to try to shoot it through while you're feeding the babies so you don't shoot a whole syringe-full all at once. I had to stop several times during a feeding to clear the syringe opening so I could continue feeding. I'm not sure I'll use this with my next clutch."
141976,2,"Brandy, just hated it. Had to return it. She got stomach aches and acid reflux after 2 use of it. I didn't see a noticeable improvement of her teeth. Returned the damn item, they charged me $6 for shipping, so got almost nothing back."
94195,2,"The few large pieces shown in the photo are the only pieces of that size you will get. The rest are little better than strings, useless as chew toys as well as too small or too short for most toy making."
58305,2,"So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'. It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions. I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy. They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought. AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes. It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product."
133176,1,"I have an American Pit Bull Terrier that is extremely hard to buy toys for. Everything that I bought was shredded and in some cases eaten, even toys that were rated for extreme chewers. After much trial and error I lucked into Planet Dog. Planet Dog balls are indestructible and my APBT loves them!! After months of play they are still like new - they don't show any wear and tear like with other toys (Nylabone, Tire-biters, etc.). If your dog likes to play ball and is an extreme chewer try Planet Dog, you will not be disappointed."
33187,0,"This variety seems to be more shredded when you open the can - sorta like Shredded Wheat cereal in appearance. Because of that, I think it's getting stuck in my cat's teeth whenever he tries to eat it because he's always using his paw to try to get the food out of his teeth. He won't eat this anymore at all - he figures out what it is and that's it. It's a great idea, but it seems to fray and get stuck in his teeth. He gets a little aggravated over it so I took all of them back to the store."
151744,1,"Baught this for my 8lb yorki-poo. She loves it. She loves being able to look out the window, and see what is going on around her. She fits pretty good in it. if she was any bigger im not sure if this would accomidate her. Good buy though, glad I got it for her."
121598,0,I bought some derm tabs from our veterinarian some time ago that worked very well and I thought these were the same. They were not and did not work as well in promoting a soft coat and relieving dry skin. I have found that regular Fish Oil capsules work just as well if not a little better then these.
3775,0,"When used right out of the can,and even mixed over dry food two of my dogs had loose stool. Right on the verge of being the runs. So I have too strain out the solids and get rid of most of the liquid. Even so they love the taste, too bad of the latter."
116764,0,"No matter how I size it, my Shetland Sheepdog can back right out of it. (Their heads are smaller than their necks and this collar does not tighten enough to stay put.) I'm going back to a slip collar as soon as Amazon can ship one to me."
21591,0,"We bought this glass water bottle for our guinea pigs because we want to limit their exposure to plastic and we needed something easier to clean. This bottle cleans up much easier than their old plastic ones and the water seems fresher. It's our one guinea pig's favorite water bottle! If he has a choice, he will drink from this one more than any other bottle we give him. There's a little green plastic turtle that floats to show the water level. The guinea pig loves to watch the turtle while he's drinking, and we love to watch the guinea pig watch the turtle!My only complaint with this bottle is that it's hard to attach the cap and get a good vacuum seal. We've learned to screw the cap on very, very tightly and flip the bottle up and down a couple of times to create the right vacuum that let's the water flow easily when the animal is drinking. Unfortunately the very tightly cranked cap means it's very hard to unscrew. If you have any strength or dexterity limitations in your hands, I would not recommend this bottle. Or if there are multiple people with various levels of experience or attention to detail (like children or pet sitters) who will be changing the bottle, I wouldn't recommend it. We've learned the tricks to make it work so we're reasonably happy with it although I don't think I'll order another one."
207987,1,"No complaints about this food. Our breeder recommended it for our 8 wk old Frenchie and this food seemed good in that Luna ate most of it and her stool was pretty firm. Gas was not a real problem. We switched to Blue Buffalo, which has firmed up her stool a bit more (which I prefer), but no complaints about this food. I just found one that's better for us."
139489,0,"Like others have said, these are literally small maxi pads. I have a 150 lb dog who is having issues wetting herself while she is taking steroid medication so I bought these pads to go inside the Washable Diapers I purchased, (made by Simple Solution, bought here on Amazon). The pads seem to absorb most of the leakage, but they are fairly narrow and don't hold much liquid. If they had ""wings"" or were thicker it would be better.I ended up buying human adult diaper liners at walmart (about 20 large liners for about 6 bucks) and they are working well.So, I would say just buy adult liners from your local store. It will end up saving you money."
12613,2,"My cat doesn't like them at all. I have even tried to re-wet them and she refuses to eat them. I have placed them within her wet food, and she eats around them. It was a waste of money. I had to wait almost a month for them to be delivered, they should have kept them!"
151411,0,"We have a fat cat who can't monitor his intake. Whenever we wanted to go away even for a day, we couldn't leave the cat and had to pay to have it go to cat kennel; however, with the pet feeder we can go away worry free for a few days. Also, you can set up to eight feedings a day which is nice because he can get a bunch of small meals and he doesn't bother us for food anymore (although he sits by the feeder alot).The problem is that because the horizontal auger (good idea) comes all the way out to the feeder whole. Even our cat (not very smart) was able to figure out how to jiggle the auger to get food whenever he wanted. We had to cover the whole and dish with some metal to keep his paws out. After getting it all in place, it works well, but the cats will keep trying so we had to try a few different things before we could ensure he wasn't getting too much food."
58020,0,"While the concept is great - my dog LOVES empty pop bottles - he doesn't have any interest in this particular toy. I think it is pretty sturdy, though I may not be the best judge as he hasn't really played hard with it. He has a ton of toys and this is his least favorite. It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made."
58295,0,"My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest. Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full. He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around. I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy."
34469,0,"The Deedle Dude kept my 70 pound lab entertained for all about a week but then the voice box just went silent. My lab brought it to me to have me look at it but I couldn't tell why it stopped without ripping open the toy and taking all the stuffings out. Oh well, it was great for at that one week but now it's just another stuffed animal toy for my dog."
180227,2,This is not the wonderfully described product... if a wet noodle fell on it... yep it will collaspe. My cats knocked it over and 2 birds escaped... yes... dead Cordon Bleu's. I'd like to ring their necks for selling such a dangerous bird product... I have nailed it to the wall. I also bought the cages for this model... they don't fit right either... PLEASE do not buy this product... let them sit and lose money by not selling it.
31213,0,"I liked this design compared to the traditional three-knot style that other companies use. However, the actual rope that was used to make this example did not hold up very long to my dog's chewing. Other three-knot ropes usually last about a week with my puppy and this lasted only a few days before it was shredded to pieces.If your dog is a light chewer I could see this being a good toy but for a moderate to heavy chewer like my puppy I would stay away and try another rope."
204832,0,"I love the Petmate Kennels. We are hobby breeders and our dogs are trained to sleep in them at night. Overall the Vari Kennel Ultra gets a thumbs up. It's well built and a good value for the price. My one complaint is that they have a couple of bumps molded into the center of the bottom of the kennel. It is right in the area where the dog would sleep. When I received the first one, I thought perhaps it was a factory second. It almost looked like a molding for a handle which should not be on the bottom of the crate. I went to a neighborhood petmart where they had more of the kennels. Sure enough they had the same molding on the bottom center. The salesperson said that people just buy a cushion to cover it. That would be fine if I did not raise puppies. Till they are done teething they would probably eat a cushion a night! I called Petmate and mentioned it to them so I hope they took note of it. I think it saves them money to mold the top and bottom the same."
40211,1,This has taken the unpleasantness out of having an indoor cat. No more litter dust or getting close to cat excrement. It's a simple design and works consistently.
216671,1,my dog is just too dumb and/or scared to climb them...they terrified her...i held chunks of ham at the top of the second stair and still no way she would use these...i have no idea why because she climbs all other stairs very well; not afraid...sorry to say i had to return these to amazon...
5511,0,"My white Peke has had eye issues - lots of tearing - since I got him at 2 years old from a Rescue. I have not had white dogs before so this was the 1st I've dealt with it. I tried a liquid to rub on from a BIG Pet Store - NO EFFECT. I also tried another brand of this type of food additive and it did nothing. Angels' Eyes takes a whole bottle, daily dosage, to even begin making an impact that is substantial, but with the 2nd bottle there is change. I don't know if it's because of the better formulation or the fact that I already tried 2 bottles (One Angels Eyes and the other brand) first, but there is HOPE! I even shaved his stained fur from around his eyes to get a better idea of whether it was actually working. It does. Thanks for the product - but the price is unreasonable I think for the ""lifetime"" use required. I would love to see the price reduced... it causes people to either quit or cut back on dosages - less effective."
192138,0,"I actually have one of the litter trays pictured, and love it. It's a great product (except for the darn label, remnants of which are still visible over a year after purchase!), and has two-piece clips that lock this pan securely to the cage side. I recently ordered 2 more from Amazon, though, and received the new-style model, which is NOT pictured, and which does not have the two-piece cage locks to keep it in place. Instead, it has little tiny hooks which don't hook far enough over the cage wires. Consequently, it doesn't stay on the cage. If you can find the model pictured, I would recommend purchasing it. Buyer beware on the newer style."

141076,1,I bought this toy for my 1 year old kitten Pix and she absolutely loves it. Her favorite is the original feather attachment that flutters like a real bird. She doesn't care too much about the other attachments but if I run around the house with them she will chase it until I get tired of running. The original attachment had to be replaced about 4 months later which is remarkable considering that some of her other toys only lasted all of 48 hours. Not unreasonable since all cats have teeth and most have claws. Pix and I give this 5 stars for being the best cat toy ever!

89308,0,"I really liked the invisible fence, and the portable remote that came with my unit. They both worked wonderfully for a couple of months. I took the remote on walks with my dogs, and although I never had to use it, I believe it would have been very helpful if they had decided to take off after a wild animal or another dog. Unfortunately, the invisible fence quit working after a thunderstorm. I looked online, and found that lightening can take them out. I searched for a way to fix the problem, but could not locate the break in the wire or a way to fix it without replacing the whole thing. We get many thunderstorms in this area, so I decided to chain the dogs again."
111156,1,"3rd & FINAL UPDATE: 1/31/13 Customer service emailed me promptly, apologized and sent a new bale out, next day, no charge (for product OR shipping), and I didn't have to return the bad bale (which I will either donate to our local Humane Society if they can use it or use on my garden next spring). This bale was like the first one, nice sized, very clean shavings...no dust, no dirt, no junk! I'm very happy with the way this was handled and remain a loyal Amazon customer! ...(PS - By now, I've been using this stuff in our doghouses for a couple months, through some very cold temps, and I have to say, this stuff does work as outdoor dog house bedding...it's warm, it's clean, the dogs seem to really like it....they can't wait to get in their house every time I refresh/put new stuff in....it comes in a nice box so stores well in our garage. It does the job, BUT I still really hate the mess it makes from sticking to everything and tracking in so badly, and it's certainly not an economical bedding for this use, but I'll buy it again next winter if I can't find some straw because it is SO much better for an outdoor pet (as far as providing warmth) than anything else...like blankets or anything cloth.)2nd UPDATE, 1/10/12 (Original review at bottom): Got my 2nd bale of this stuff, and now I see why the price was $6 less than the one I got last fall (from $38 to $32). This bale is of VERY POOR QUALITY! The shavings are very, VERY tiny, lots of sawdust and just generally DIRTY throughout! Literally looks to me as if it was the last of a run, bottom of the barrel. The first bale I got was very good quality, nice size shavings, very clean, no dust. This bale is more suited for use as garden mulch, NOT animal bedding. I have emailed Amazon saying I'd like a replacement but DO NOT feel I should have to pay the return shipping cost. If the first bale I'd gotten was like this bale, I never would've ordered another. This is the first time I've ever returned anything to Amazon, so now I'll see how good their customer service is.1st UPDATE, Dec 30, 2012: I just ordered another bale since I know what I have left from the first bale will not last through the winter. Was VERY pleasantly surprised to see the price is $6 less than it was when I ordered last fall. Still hoping to find straw for next winter, though.Original review: (Nov 2012) We have 2 outdoor farm dogs & 2 insulated, heated doghouses. Clean straw (not HAY) is a MUCH warmer bedding than blankets but it's getting almost impossible to buy the small square bales of straw anymore, around here, anyway. It's mostly the super-sized round bales these days, and I don't have the equipment to handle those huge bales or an indoor space large enough to store one . The one and only place I did find a few small bales, they'd been stored outside for awhile and were dirty ......and dirty ANYTHING never makes for warmth. So, in desperation, I bought this large ""bale"" of aspen bedding to try this winter. It's packed REALLY tight, so you get ALOT more than what you think from looking at it, it has no odor that might bother scenting dogs, it seems to provide nice warmth and comfort, and it's clean and dust-free...all good points for my intended use. But, within a few days I realized it's really too light weight for doghouse bedding, mostly because it won't ""stay put"", which means it has to be replenished more often because it gets dragged out of the houses plus it is MESSY!!! It sticks to the dogs' fur, so they drag it out of the houses, it sticks to your clothing/coat sleeves and gloves when you put your hand in to check the heaters, to make sure the bedding is dry, to add more bedding, etc., it sticks to your shoes/boots, to your pants....IT STICKS TO EVERYTHING, then tracks into the garage, up the steps, into the porch and even after taking off boots, coats, gloves and dusting off everything else, it still manages to make its way into the house. Straw also sticks to clothing, tracks around and is rather messy, but NOTHING like this stuff! Plus straw is much cheaper. This is not an economical doghouse bedding solution (although it's the best price I found for this type of bedding). When I first say how tightly it was packed and how much it expanded, I thought one bale should easily last til spring, but I didn't count on the loss of material due to it sticking to everything. So now I'm just crossing my fingers that one bale will get us through the winter. Next fall I will broaden my search area and try even harder to find clean and manageable sized straw bales! I would guess this stuff is great for gerbils and hamsters, etc, and it DOES work for doghouse bedding if you can't get straw...and unless I can find straw next fall, I'll probably be using it again because it's definitely superior to blankets/cloth bedding for warmth."
153076,0,"I got this about a week ago. I really liked it. However, my cats were afraid to poo in it. This morning one finally did. I kept hearing her try and cover it up, but she couldn't because well...she must have held it in or something. It was huge. I immediately turned on the Genie and guess what? It missed 1 of the 3 turds in there. I figured it would capture everything eventually, so I went back to bed. Soon I smelled something strange and unlike anything I've ever smelled in my life. It was the poo mixed with the Sani Solution. I don't have a weak gag reflex, but I almost threw up. I had to turn off the heat and open up all my windows for this place to air out. I really hate cleaning the litterbox, but OMG I wasn't expecting that stench.If you get one of these things, seriously put it somewhere out of the way of regular foot traffic. I have to keep mine in the hallway of my apartment because it's closest to the cold water hose in the washing machine, which is in my bathroom next to the hallway.I will never be able to get that smell out of my memory now..."

It states it is for dogs 10 to 25 pounds and my 15 pound puppy had this completely in his mouth the moment I gave it to here. I did buy the large one and she loves it.
89326,0,I researched several pet seats before purchasing this one. It arrived with a broken strap so I substituted a shoulder strap from a piece of carry on luggage for the lower strap which made it very secure. I called the manufacturer and they shipped me a replacement strap immediately but I'm still using the luggage strap. The seat was easy to assemble and install. My only complaint is that the safety clip is a little flimsy and difficult to secure to a wiggling dog... it would be better if it was more like the clip on a leash.

190036,0,"I don't own one of these, but after reading the reviews it seems that buying some heavy duty screws to use in place of the ones that are being sent with the bed might be a wise idea. Not sure why the manufacturer hasn't upgraded the screws themselves with all the bad feedback they must be recieving. Good Luck!"
136520,0,"After 5 months of use with two kittens, I've mostly given up on using this. The concept is great, the engineering wonderful, but there is one basic problem with this litter box. When the globe rotates, the litter coats the inside of the globe. Some little pieces of the used litter also gets wedged in behind the inside cover that shields retained litter from the clumps that are being dumped out. Over time, it simply begins to stink. The cats that use it are in the coated inner globe and end up with litter all over their fur, so they stink too.I tried washing out the globe and ended up with wet clump litter wedged in behind the inner cover. The globe is riveted together (not bolted) so there is no way to take it apart and thoroughly clean it. I contacted the vendor and they were great to send a new globe, but within a few weeks, I ended up with the same problem. After researching every automated litter box out there, I have concluded that there simply isn't a perfect solution. This one comes the closest of all the box solutions that I've tried, but in the end, the only way around the stinking cat box is to send them outside to dig in the garden. With a new cat door in place, they are doing just that. Now this is a backup litter box in the basement and we're all just fine with that."
58290,0,"My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out.He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound.Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest.Anyway, the search continues for the perfect dog toy."
19627,1,I was very satisfied with the product - one tab worked right away and I had no trouble giving it to my cat.I was also pleased with the prompt shipping but it came at a price. The package weighed almost nothing but the shipping was more expensive than the product.
54715,2,"We've used Bitter Apple in the past as a deterrent for our dog chewing at his paws and couldn't find it in our local pet store. So we tried Phooey instead. It barely got a negative reaction out of our dog. Moments later, he went back to chewing."
159408,0,"The product was alright; however,I think it would have functioned better if all the componets were connected (fused) instead of them being taken off when you remove it from your dog. Besides that--it was a nice product."
13012,1,Excellent tool at removing excess/lose hair without tangling or getting caught in the fur. The plastic prongs slide through the hair much easier than similar metal ones I've used.
209171,2,It literally took our 15 pound mixed breed less than 10 minutes to break off plastic pieces. Really poor quality.
105123,2,"I have gone through many dog beds and I was hoping this would be the one that would last. Unfortunately it wasn't. I have an eighteen month old English Pointer that loves to chew everything, especially her bed while she's in her crate at night. This bed appears to be made well and if your dog doesn't chew on beds this would be a good choice. It fit perfect in her crate and for the short time that it was in one piece, my dog snuggled up in it very comfortably. (I bought it for much less somewhere else)"
44349,1,"My cats love drinking from this. I bought one of these 2 years ago and the pump just finally gave out. Not bad for being on 24/7 for 2 years. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because this new one is more noisy compared to the old one. (the old one was very quiet) Still more quiet than the Drinkwell Pet Fountain, which my cats would not even go near."
209281,0,Pay attention to the label this is not a chew toy. Only use for tossing and tugging. Once your dog lays down to chew take it away from your dog. It does not fly far about 8-10 feet. After less than 10 minutes of chewing my dog had bitten a hole on the edge of the toy. It still flys and is a fun toy to play with.
151330,2,"When I ordered the Handi Drink, I had recently purchased a Gulpy from a local store as a gift. It was a great success, and Sam, the recipient, loves it. When I decided to buy a Gulpy for my dog, the only one available on Amazon was $24 (it is now priced much, much lower) so I ordered the Handi Drink. It is not nearly as easy to use as the Gulpy. The Gulpy water bottle swings up and you squeeze the bottle to squirt the water into the water tray. The Handi Drink bottle is separate and must be removed from the water tray and then be placed into a notch in the water tray. Also, it is difficult to get the water out of the Handi Drink...I never did make it work well. I tossed the Handi Drink and went back to the store and bought a Gulpy!"
5545,1,"I have a two year old Shih Tzu. Shih Tzu's have water eyes which result in tear stains and odor. I started Angel Eyes in December and instantly, after her first dose, I could tell the difference. This is probably hard to believe but the day after her first dose her face was dry all day. It was awesome. She still has some tears but her face is dry more often than it is wet, the tears no longer discolor her fur and she no longer has the odor. I used to wash her face daily to get rid of the odor now whether I wash her face or not, there is no odor. I would highly recommend this product if your dog has a tear stained face."
191699,0,"The JW Pet Company Invincible Chains Triple Dog Toy, SMALL is not well-suited for my 12 pound poodle. First the rings are too thick/round in diameter and are too heavy. My little guy loves to tug and thought this would be the perfect toy for him. I've had it for about 2 weeks now and he hardly plays with it. He'll pick it up, take a few steps with it then puts it down and finds another toy to play with. I'd say it's sized more for a med to med/large dog."

156965,1,"We first got this toy when our puppy was about 12 weeks old. She initially got very frustrated and would yelp and bark if the food didn't come out easily. It can also tighten and close the size of the opening for food to come out. She is older now and loves playing with this toy - but it doesn't provide more than 5-10 minutes of entertainment.Not worth the price, but if you need multiple ""busy toys"" for your dog, this isn't a bad option."
58618,2,We were very disappointed with these masks. They didn't last anywhere's near as long as the ones we've previously bought from this company. Quality control maybe?
2881,0,"I ordered this about 2 weeks ago.. shipping came fast ( APO so it takes a minute tog et here) and well for starters.. the litter box i recived is not 7 inches tall like advertised... it is 10""... not complaining... my bunny is little now but i know how fast they grow and it will come in handy, secondly. there is no way to attach it to the cage that i can see.... thirdly, in the picture it shows angled sides... this one has curvy sides. i got mine in lime-ish green for any of those whom were curious of what colors are arriving, not really worried about that sense it says colors may vary.. but size and shape should not... over all i think it will fit the purpous well as long as my rabbit chooses not to use the litter pan as a toy and trys to push it around, just glad im using a dog crate for its cage and made the shelf in the middle, not on the lower level or it wouldnt have fit. it is a thick plastic so i forsee it holding up to time in cage with bunny:)"
133331,0,Brownie only chews on this when there is nothing else to chew on and very reluctantly. He's 20 pounds and can finish one in about 5 minutes.
154241,0,"Literally (litterly?)...it really does stink. Maybe it is my cat and certain other kinds of cats, but crystal litter (the only type you can use in this this), does nothing to control the urine smell. In fact the combination of the two was worse than urine and clay litter that has been sitting there for a couple of days. We had it for about a month and while I liked the mechanics of it better than the previous LitterMaid, we just couldn't handle the smell. Thankfully the big box pet store took it back....used and all. God bless them for that because I would hate to think I had to package this up for mailing if that was even an option."
110731,0,"I got this for my miniature schnauzer who is really PUSHING the word ""miniature"". :) The collar is genuine leather - and is particularly tough to work with if you need to use the first notch. So if you're thinking your dog could possibly use the next size up, get it! It took several tries to get it put on, and even then my husband had to do it - I couldn't. I think the more you thread through the buckle, the better off you are.Once we got it on, it looked great! However, if you are one of those who likes to give your dog a hug or snuggle just know that these spikes don't just look like spikes - they don't feel great when touched. That said, I worried about when he would snuggle down to sleep and the collar would turn around on him - if they were going to stick him in the chin/neck.I intend to return this one and get another very similar looking one from the same company. Just not spikes!One more thing, I got this leash to go with it and it looks really good with it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VMK53U/ref=oh_details_o04_s01_i00"
87551,1,"I use this tie out for my very strong Tree Walker Hound. It is great, not only because it is strong, but it doesn't tangle as easily as some of the lighter cable tie outs. The only issue I had with this item was one of the clips stopped working properly. But I was able to fix it."
158261,1,"After looking at Petsmart and Petco I went online to Amazon and found this same crate for half the price. It's a pretty standard no frills crate, but that is all my mother needed for her little terrier. It folds up easily, sets up in a few seconds and is light enough for her to carry when she needs to move it. It has a plastic tray type floor which is good if you are housebreaking a puppy or have an older dog with incontinence problems. I would not hesitate to buy this product again or recommend it to others."

152418,0,the system works good incorporated with a perminent fence.takes alot of time to bury the wire. the wire is whimpyand not really heavy guage as touted. wire breaks easily.BUT the system does work. I would suggest not using the wirethat comes with and buying a better gauge at the hardware store.also the surge protector option is low quality.
64363,0,"so far the hummers haven't embraced this feeder. the colors are not as bright as they appear in the picture. I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I know the dullness of the color. unfortunately, it fell the first day so I have it taped so that the bottom doesn't fall off. i am hoping the birds begin to use it."
156339,1,"This treat ball works great. I use it for my lab's regular feedings. I simply fill the ball with her dog food and let her push it around until she's gotten out all she can. It only took her a few minutes to figure out how it worked when I first got it. Now she's a pro at pushing it around, picking it up, and dropping it to get her food.Each feeding takes about 2 refills to go through her usual dog food amount. When she first started, it would take about 45 minutes for her meal. She's gotten a lot better at it and can finish in about 30. That's better than the roughly 2 minutes it would take to eat her dog food straight from a bowl. I'm no vet, but my understanding is it's much better for them to eat slowly rather than wolf down their food and risk getting too much air in their stomachs.It's also nice because it gives me more time to get ready in the morning without having to worry about her getting into trouble. As long as food keeps popping out of the treat ball, it has her undivided attention.One warning for owners with ""power chewers."" You should not leave the ball with the dog once they have gotten all of the food/treats from it. Mine has already chewed small pieces off, and given enough time with it, could probably chew it in half. As soon as your dog is done, take it away and give them something safer to chew on.All in all, this is a great product that keeps my dog's attention and has completely replaced feeding her from a bowl."
25129,0,"I read the reviews and I decided to buy this cologne for my dog, but the smell doesn't last, and it;s not that strong. I have purchased another colognes, like ck-8, wich I love because of the smell and it last at least 24 hours.This one is fine for two hours.."
53276,1,"This is one of my favorite feeders, because it's right there in front of your nose! Hummingbirds are very fast. I've gone entire years only seeing one sighting that year because I wasn't sitting by the feeder when they happened to come by. By sticking the feeder where it is always visible, that little movement will catch your eye, and you'll probably see them daily! I know I do!Because it's made of glass, and not plastic like the normal seed-feeders, it is on the heavy side and needs to be attached securely. I read some reviews where people had trouble connecting it. I found it quite easy, just clean the glass, oil the cups a bit and press. It's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it. Just about EVERY hummingbird feeder I have has a small exit area - otherwise the nectar wouldn't come out slowly! A funnel is 39 cents and makes filling *very* easy.I have 10+ hummingbird feeders and this is by far the best for consistant hummingbird viewing."
214391,1,"I've spent hundreds of dollars on varying types of shampoos and conditioners, and I must admit that the Eqyss products have had outstanding performance rating in my home.I have multiple longhair dogs each with their own ""problems"" from varying causes both genetic and environmental. Over time, each one seemed to have their own ""unique or vet-recommended shampoo"" to fix the problems. I could not use every shampoo on every dog since some had lovely coats that would get dried out from harsh shampoos, or overly oily coats that wouldn't come clean with the gentle shampoos.When I found Micro-Tek, EVERY dog could be bathed in it without issue! Every dog I owned's problem was curbed by Micro-Tek just as well as any specific shampoo I have purchased over the last 4 years and at 1/4 to 1/2 the price. It's so nice to buy one ""Gallon sized shampoo"" and get rid of the clutter of multiple types of shampoo in my cabinets. My life is more organized and my dogs are very happy, beautiful and itch-free - what more could I ask for?This shampoo dillutes very well in a hose-end sprayer too. I find I use a lot less shampoo that way, but can only do this in warmer months of course.Eqyss Mega-Tek (conditiner) and the Marigold Fly sprays are also must haves in my book. All of their products have a lovely non-perfumy non-overpowering scent to them."
181487,2,Bought a K and H model 003 which quit working after two winters. I am very disappointed with that fact and that I have to spend the time and more $ in finding a replacement that is 1) not made by K and H and 2) not made or assembled in China. Two winters is not enough at any price.

192398,1,"My dog needs attention almost 24-7... her favorite thing is to play fetch non stop. I've been looking for toys that can keep her interest without me...I picked up the everlasting treat ball the last time I was in the pet stop... for the past two and a half days, she has played with this. At first she spent 5 hours straight trying to lick the treat to death... it's still in there, a donut of a treat now... but since then, periodically she goes to town playing with it-- she throws it around the room like a kong, she carries it in her mouth (and she's only a 5lb chihuahua mix, so it's definitely a light toy), and she puts it between her paws and licks/chews it to death. I've only had it for a few days, but I'm impressed with how long the treat part has lasted... I got one filler pack and I am going to get more! These things are great... and I am imagining that on our next plane ride, this will come in handy."
168094,0,"This leash is very sturdy and well-made EXCEPT for the reflective material. It began to peel off the handle during the 1st use. Within a month less than half remained and I finally peeled the rest off because it was making a mess. I am here to buy another one because it finally tore up after 2 years of very heavy use by my large, rambunctious, water-loving lab. I can't find another leash like it so I'm just going to get another one and plan to peel the reflective material off sooner this time."

208585,0,"I used this machine for several years when I first started shearing sheep. I had the 2.5"" yoke assembly and then switched over to the 3"" yoke. This machine is OK if you only have a few sheep to shear and you get these clippers as a gift. The Wahl Lister Laser shearing machine is sold here at Amazon for only about $30 more and it is WAY more powerful a machine for doing sheep shearing then the shearmaster. I have used the Lister Laser for about 25 years and I still have the shearmaster for emergency use, but I have not used it in about 22 years or more. The shearmaster has bushings for all of the bearings in the head. The Lister laser has roller bearings. That feature alone makes the laser drive on past the point of no return when the shearmaster stops. When the cutter and comb decide that they have had enough and you are only half way thru shearing this particular sheep, you must stop and replace the blades if you are using the shearmaster. If you are using the laser, you can tighten down more then you know is good for the blades, but the machine will not stop and you might just be able to finish that sheep so you can then replace the blades. Try that with the shearmaster and the machine will physically stop cutting.... something to consider..."

The wire is flimsy and one of the bars snapped as I went to close one of the cage doors, also where the cage 'clips' together at the corners there's a pretty big gap. I have a prety light hand, if I could snap part of the door just by closing it what will my kits be able to do once they get older and bigger??Needless to say I will be returning this cage, it's unfortunate because the design with the plastic bottom, wheels, and multi levels is perfect.

And then only shortly after using for approx. a month 1/2, I noticed that it must have been leaking around the motor since the time I had received it, as over time it finally came through the floor boards into the basement. We did all the required regular cleanings but were continually adding water, not realizing that the plastic had 4 small cracks around the o-ring of the motor. Now the time has past for a replacement and my cat is back up on the sink. Anyway I would love to try again, but don't want to have the same problem. If Drinkwell was willing to send out a replacement item free of charge, I would be very grateful and be sure to tell my daughter, yes, go ahead and order one for your cat."
25429,0,The gate is functional and just what I expected for the price. It is nice to have the protective bar on the top to prevent pinching your fingers (which happened to me many times in the past).

ONLY THE MAT.2) Product photo shows assortment of bowls on top of the mat which one assumes represents the item being purchased.This assumption is backed up in the Product Features description. No disqualifier states that bowls are notincluded.Poor quality:1) Mat is thin and flimsy (see photo);so flimsy that folding it in shipping caused damage.2) Mat is definitely not worth almost $7, perhaps $2 if not damaged.I would definitely not recommend this product."

60032,2,"I bought the Frontline Plus for my dog from The Pet Plaza one month ago. My dog (Tse-Tsu breed) is only 11 pounds. After I tried 2 dosage in one month, my dog still has lots of fleas. The Frontline does not works for my dog."

154405,2,"This item was pretty good a year or so ag when I purchased it from Petsmart. But recently it has been malfunctioning a lot! It lost the metal squares that cling to the magnets so that it raises and lowers, the outer teeth to the comb are easily bent, and it does stink often. I am sad that not only did I pay over 100 dollars for this bu then have to spend 16 dollars every other week to replace the litter. It is a money pit and I am searching for a replacement!"
210792,2,This pet bed is no more than if you had a blanket or quilt for the dog to lay. Cheaply made product would not recommend!!!
210475,2,"So sure this thing works ""ok"", but it made my condo smell horrible!!! It breaks down the clumps and continues to stir every hour releasing the nasty smell of old cat pee! Do not buy this item! I tried it for 2 weeks until I couldn't handle the smell that filled my whole place. I emptied it every day or every other day, but to keep the smell down I would have had to change the entire litter every other day or so. I went back to the old fashioned litter box and there is no more smell. The box is really bulky and definately not worth the price I paid. I am going to give it as a gift just to get rid of it. I will then laugh when they have the same smelly problem. DO NOT BUY!!!"
155116,0,What can i say. Im not the one eating it! I have to add wet food to it and mix it in or my dog wont eat it. I dont know how well it works its only been a couple weeks. It takes 6weeks to work! It was a good price i suppose. The vets wanted 70 dollars for it.
210990,0,I know these are supposed to for dogs but I saw that cats like them too. Mine did but one day he just nuzzeled one and didn't eat it. It sat there in his bowl for three days before I threw it out. He likes them fresh from the box and if they are not eaten he won't touch it the next day. Its not like it gets stale i would thnk. They are a bit chunky for them and they need to chew into smaller pieces before swallowing. they are hard to break into smaller bits. They have a bit of a foul smell too --- not like a salmon smelll which I'm fine with. This is more like a dry bloody odor that isn't too much fun to work with .
26992,2,"Bought two of these for a turtle pond, and completely regret it. I have now replaced the magnetic impellers in both filters as least twice. The problem is that charcoal from the container leaks out and gets trapped in the impeller and destroys it. Buy an XP3 instead. It's a much better product."
119758,0,It took my 8 lb Papastzu less than an hour to destroy; added new squeaker and 5 minutes later...I had to throw away. My dog would not stop till this little ducky was FOR SURE not a threat to ANYONE any more.
24334,1,"This mix includes a lot of seed but also cereal grains and chunky pellets. Not too many sunflower seeds, a plus. I have three cockatiels and they all love it. They devour it all but seem especially to enjoy the pellets, which is surprising since they have ignored other pelleted foods. I will continue to order this.I was also very pleased with the seller (Quidsi Retail/Wag.com.) Shipping charge was very reasonable and it came, amazingly, in one day."
164752,0,"My wife and I bought this in anticipation of the arrival of our Bengal kitten. It looks really nice. Good construction, with a big fluffy pillow inside. When the kitten arrived, she quickly got used to it and would go in and out of it, no problem. However, the foam rubber forming the shell of the dome is completely exposed on the inside. I don't know if it was the smell of the foam (my sense of smell is surely not as good as a cat's, and I could easily detect the strong odor), but the cat started chewing and clawing at the inside. When she was tearing off big chunks of foam, I decided it wasn't safe. She might ingest some of the foam. So this Kitty Kondo has been relegated to storage until the day when the kitty stops chewing (she's 1-1/2 yrs. old) or we sell it. A word to the manufacturer: You should completely line the inside with the same fabric (or at least something the cat can't chew through) as the outside.The cat now has a fully-lined leopard print (matches the cat!) 2-in-1 box house/bed from which she has chewed out only a little foam from the seams at the openings ... ! :)"
143396,0,"I took a chance on the Littermaid tent after reading both good and bad reviews. It is true that the tent is cheaply made and it does take patience to zip the tent together without splitting the zipper. Now that I've had it for a month, I can say that my 3 cats love having the tent. I was worried that they would jump on top of it, but they haven't attempted this (yet, anyway). It does help to keep litter from getting everywhere. Overall, my cats and I give it a thumbs up for covering the litter box, but if a higher quality product fit over this litterbox I would try it."
2416,1,"My bull terrier's game of choice is destroy and scatter. It usually takes him less than 1 minute to render any toy useless, except for his Kong ball. No matter how hard he tries he can't seem to break this ball. He is no light chewer - he chews the metal bars right off of his crate! If you got a dog with a powerful bite and intense need to ruin any toy - this ball is for you!"
128139,0,"My dog loves, loves soft toys. I showed him how to use the toy, and would fill it for him (and he'd grab the squirrels out and rip at them) and then he figured out he could toss around and chew and tear the stump. Needless to say the stump is less capable of storing squirrels than it originally was.For what I paid for it, it's not a bad deal, but its also not as durable as I thought it would be. Perhaps the stump ought to be made of tougher material?"
209324,2,It should be called Kong Dog Toy. One thing good it does is roll pretty good. Too heavy and has a very bad flying edge.
157196,1,"Bought this for a 5 month old cat of my sister's. She works long shifts and needs something for him to play with while she's gone. He loves this toy. It's not a very heavy toy though, he can pick it up by the mouse and drag it around the house. The color I got is also not the color the picture showed. I think it's much more suited to an active, playful cat."
7898,2,This works in theory but the latch to lock it in place is ill-conceived - a person could break a finger trying to get in on and off. maybe the Four paws one is the one I was thinking of...
54526,1,As other reviewers have said - these are like crack for dogs. My very picky German Shepherd goes NUTS for these and they work great as training treats. I also like that they're good for him and don't have any bad ingredients! Will definitely get more when this giant tub runs out...which will take awhile :)
36004,1,"Considering the overwhelming amount of positive reviews here, i know i am not alone in saying that this product literally changed my life.I have a 50+lb golden retriever pit bull mix named Toby. Toby grew up in nashville, tn and then in florida. He has always been a sweetheart, but he also has always had some trouble on the leash. if there are no distractions, he is fine, but the second another dog showed up, or a squirrel took off, he would pull and lunge.I recently moved to San Francisco, California and i took my dog with me. Some may say it was cruel to move a dog from a suburban neighborhood with a front yard and a back yard to a studio apartment, but actually, i think he prefers it. When i had the option of just letting him into the yard to do his business, he was walked significantly less. Now, he gets actual walks 2-3 times a day.The problem is though, a city street is FILLED with distractions. SF is one of the most pet friendly cities in the country and there are dogs everywhere. not to mention pigeons (which have replaced squirrels as his obsession), as well as kids on skateboards. I have been walking toby for three years now, and i always felt as though i had a pretty great handle on him, but it was still incredibly stressful.anyhow, i am leaving for a week at the end of this month to visit family and i am having a friend pet sit. now, this friend is no shrinking violet but when you arent used to walking a powerful dog, any number of disasters could occur.right- so getting to the product. I decided to purchase the gentle leader and i can not express just how big of a difference it made. during the first walk, he would occasionally try to take it off, but after that, it was no problem.it felt like that moment in The Dog Whisperer where suddenly the dog is totally behaved. i really felt like i was walking someone else's dog. he walks right beside me, doesnt pull at all, and most importantly, he hasnt lunged at a dog, pigeon, or skateboarder ONCE!i am BLOWN AWAY. i also had no idea how stressed i was until the gentle leader made it all go away. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. again, it is a total LIFE CHANGER!!!"
44613,0,"We got this drining fountain the other day as one of our cats has been dehydrated and the vet suggested a product like this.

So with one problem solved we uncovered another one."

133313,0,"We recently switched my pets' (gerbils and guinea pigs) Carefresh bedding to Aspen bedding similar to this. The guinea pigs were about the same as before, but the gerbils started to run away whenever they saw anyone, and they weren't fun anymore. Then we switched the gerbils' bedding back to Carefresh and soon they started coming to the cage door when I came into the room. I hadn't even noticed that the Aspen bedding changed this until the gerbils became tamer than before. They aren't as tame as when we first changed back to Carefresh, but they are tamer than when we used Aspen bedding.As for the guinea pigs, they don't seem to mind, but I think they prefer the smaller Aspen shavings to the hard, large ones. I'm not sure which the kind here is.Aspen shavings are fine for guinea pigs, but I'd recommend Carefresh over this for gerbils. (I'm not sure about other rodents, but chinchillas are probably okay with the this kind, too.)"

105527,1,"I bought this sisal rope cat scratching post, even after reading that it tips over and is light wieght...and i am so glad i did! MY CAT LOVES IT! I had no problem keeping him off the couch after buying this. It IS lightwieght so i took a 2 lb. dumbell and it fits inside perfectly and gives it the wieght it needs. There is something about the rope that makes the kittys go crazy. He actually runs to it when i come home so he will start scratching and then expects me to pet him while he scratches and flips around...its a routine now. Anyway, i took the 2 lb. dumbell after turning the post upside down, and placed it in as far as it would got horizontally. Worked perfect for wieghing it down. My cat is a kitten but will be big soon and a big cat would scratch one time and knock it over...i have just never seen a cat go nuts over a post like this one.!!!"

9682,2,"I purchased these dog pads because I thought I could save some money on pee pads for my small dogs. The box is nice and the way they are packaged is great. But they do not compare to the Four Paws brand wee wee pads. These get soaked like a paper towel would, and the liquid spreads right off the sides. I will probably keep searching for a less expensive version of the wee wee pads, but won't spend money on these, they do not work well."
116130,0,"This is an average video to keep cats entertained, not as engaging as I had hoped. My cat seemed more interested in the Cat music video than the rest of it.

126372,1,"This brand is light years ahead of Petco and Petmate and Great Choice, etc. The quality and attention to detail is unmatched based on the 5 local pet shops. And the carrier has snap in roller wheels, and a strong strap to pull carrier or to carry it.This company thinks of everything and adds durability with attractive features. A really common sense approach with a competitive price. I wish pet shops carried more kinds of carriers in stock like they did a few years ago. No one carries stock, so I bought it online. This company, Marchioro, made in Italy, is a winner all the way around."
42754,2,"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged. I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened. First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing. I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped. Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere. Half of the bottom of the bag was open. I lost at least half of the bag. In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened. It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know. All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store. What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up. I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology. I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy. I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA. Buyer beware."

58151,0,"This toy frustrates hour Sheltie no end. He is a really smart little guy (takes paper messages to my hubby and brings back the reply, gets me the remote control, slippers and telephone, picks up his toys, gets hubby for dinner, and loves to play with toys) but he doesn't seem to get that he needs to pull the rope to get the treats out. He carries it around the house by the rope and drops it, picks it up and carries it till he drops it again, over and over... no treats come out. He finally brings it over to me and starts dropping it on my foot. Ouch! It's only good to keep him busy for a little while until he gets too frustrated, then I give him a hand with it so he finally gets a reward and put it away. Waste of money. Instead we either play 'find a treat' (he waits while I hide little treat bits around the house, then on my signal he hunts them down) or we play the shell game (I place a treat under a plastic cup, move it around with three others then he has to pick which one has the treat under it)."
114361,0,"7/28/2007We have a howling Chihuahua. He barks at everything that sounds like a stranger. The first time we bought this collar it worked a good 4 months. The case cracked, and lost a big chunk of the plastic holding the battery. The battery stopped making contact. We still used the collar for about a month after it was no longer functioning, and the dog was still pretty good about not barking. But he started doing it more and more, so we bought another one.The second one we bought was a different story. Out of the box, it just did not seem as sensitive. I could not make it spray (barking like a dog close to the sensor). The first one was real sensitive. Thinking it was the battery, I put a different battery in and the case cracked; same place as the first one. The battery cap is this heavy-duty hunk of threaded metal (about the size of five stacked dimes, slightly smaller in diameter) with a rubber o-ring gasket. It just seems you need to make it tighter. Anyway, superglue works, hot glue gun doesn't on this plastic... It's now been about three months since we've had a functioning collar, and the dog is back to howling.The ultrasonics/beepers don't work, and my wife refuses to consider the shockers. OK I'm breaking down and buying this one more time. This time I won't break it.What I have learned:Pros:Citronella is very effective with my dogs.Battery indicator is effective (slow flashing led)Low spray indicatory is effective (fast flashing led)Refill is easyThe unit is surprisingly small, and fits a medium-sized Chihuahua.Cons:These suckers are expensive, and don't last long.The plastic looks rugged, but is very brittle. Be very careful tightening the battery cap.There is no sensitivity adjustment.6-volt batteries are expensive (Come on! This has got to be a conspiracy. How about using something rechargeable?)1 star for quality/expense5 star for effectivenessEquals 3-starsUpdate 9/30/2007:We bought two more when I wrote the review (and I didn't break them this time). It's been about two months, and one of them no longer holds the citronella. It cracked in the back, and the citronella visibly leaks out when we try to refill it, probably because our dog scratches it with hiss hind leg frequently. The other is cracked pretty good but still functioning. In general their poor quality plastic ruins what could be an excellent product. I'd downgrade my review to 1-star if amazon would let me. This is just too expensive at $69 for something that lasts a couple months if that..."

104636,2,This toothpaste is ok but doesn't get my dog's teeth as shiny and white as the CET toothpaste I normally get. I thought I would try this one since it cost less. I also would have preferred to have 2 toothbrushes instead of the finger brush. The finger brush is so soft as to be useless. I have a 2 year old Chow-Newfoundland. I brush his teeth every night and after a week there was nothing left of the finger brush! I would rather spend a little more and get the CET toothpaste from another vendor that also has free shipping. Don't buy CET via Amazon's 3rd party sellers or you will have to pay for shipping.
83482,1,"It arrived bent from shipping, but I was still able to put it together without too much trouble. (I think that it would have been a bit easier if it wasn't bent.) Overall it's great and it's given our puppy room to roam when we have to leave her. The two doors are a good option so that you can put it however you are in the room. Our puppy likes being in her crate so it's not an issue for us, but I'm not sure that the door would remain closed for a dog that wants to get out. There is a small latch, but I'm pretty sure a dog could get out without too much trouble if you didn't reinforce it in some way. Overall it's great!"
210316,0,I purchased this litter box at the begnning of November. It has been a lifesaver for the two new kittens that I have. All of a sudden the other day it started to make awful noise and just quit working. I wish it would have lasted longer!!
160045,0,"I rated it 3 stars, because it is cooler than say vinyl flooring, but it doesn't offer that much relief. If you want to get an idea of what it's like, put a piece of 1 inch foam in a zip lock bag and saturate the foam with water. Close the bag and lay it on the floor. That's basically what the bed is. It is cooler than other surfaces, but my dogs gave it a mediocre response. They would rather lay on the tile or laminate floor.I would shop around. I got mine out-of-season on clearance at a pet store chain."
32627,0,"I purchased this product back in July 2011 because my cat loves to play in his water and I read that this might help. It did. He barely ever plays in his water anymore. However, this product is a pain to clean since it has so many tight spaces and creases for gunk to build up in. I started out cleaning this product every week, but it gets dirty so fast that I soon had to increase my cleanings. This would not be enough for me to dislike this product except that lately, my cat has developed a bald spot on his chin with little black dots. My cat is an indoor only cat and I give him flea/tick/dewormer every month so these should not be an issue. I again did a little research and found out that plastics can harbor bacteria which can cause feline acne. From what I read and saw, this fits the description of what my cat has. I am now switching to a ceramic fountain. I would not suggest this product."

101479,1,"This cage over-all is well built, very roomy plenty of space for a hamster..--BUT the tubes are very hard to keep together..I had to tape them to keep them from falling apart. My suggestion if you get this cage is to keep enough tubing so your hamster can crawl up to the second story,(throw away the rest of the tubes!) and lower the wheel to ground level so he/she can just jump on the wheel. It is a great cage otherwise, your hamster will enjoy living in it!"

40994,2,This is a slide gate not a swing gate. I was upset when it arrived. It has no secure way to keep it together and it requires you to own a drill to put in holes. The wood does not appear sturdy and once assembled it would have a gap in the middle and no swinging attachment. Unless you have a very wide doorway this item does not slide in enough for a single person to walk through. In my huge entryway this item would not work. I had to return it for a refund.
47302,0,"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it."
39279,0,"This box is a dream come true for cat people, right? Totally marvelous. Unfortunately, the manufacture is so sloppy you can get a hernia trying to lock those tabs. No wonder the Chinese laugh at us for accepting the crap they send us. I used a box cutter to trim the plastic tabs so they would fit into the slots. When I finally got it put together everything was fine, I rolled it, removed the little box and dumped it. Very tidy. I can see that it will make my life easier and my cat's life pleasanter, plus the hole is too small for the dogs to stick their heads in, if you know what I mean. I just wish it wasn't such a total POS as far as manufacture is concerned."
194946,0,"My husband and I are pretty busy people, and there's nothing I hate more than spending what little free time we have running to the pet store to get pet food. With Amazon Subscribe and Save, we are able to get this delivered right to our front door at the same (or lower) cost of running to the pet store or market.This particular formula seems to be fine for our 2 spoiled felines. We switch them back and forth between this, Chicken and rice, and Indoor formula and I haven't seen an increase or decrease in hairball activities. They seems to still have the occassional hairball, but I think that's pretty typical.For the price I feel that this brand and formula provide a good diet and nutrients that our furbabies need."

This stuff smells gross but dogs love it."
185360,2,"My 4-lb yorkie puppy loved the extra small frog. However, he destroyed the squeaker in less than 5 minutes. He did the same with the extra squeaker. Most of his squeakers in his other toys have survived so perhaps the lack of padding in this one makes it easier to destroy the squeaker. He still plays with the frog sans the squeaker but it's not as exciting for him."
88783,0,"The Drinkwell Platinum works fine, except that water level is usually at, and occasionally over the top of the bowl. Why, you ask? Probably the combination of the relatively hard aquafier water in this region (southern New Mexico) and the elevation of 4,000 feet. (Remember that high school physics lesson about atmospheric pressure pushing down on everything --- we just have a little less pressure here at 4,000 feet.) So, I give the product three stars, since the manufacturer didn't mention this limitation."
152683,0,worked good at first she is still getting used to them trys to remove them. one note of advice remove the lens till they get used to them the lens plastic is so soft that she scratched them by head diving in the grass. will not buy anymore unless they do something about how soft the lens plastic is. this was within 20 min of removeing them from plastic adjusting them and letting her go outside.
177851,0,"As I shop for a new, replacement contain 'n train collar I feel it necessary to share feedback on my experience thus far.The containment system is well thought out and works well. How long it holds up is another question. After 1.5 years the lithium battery would no longer take a charge. Be aware that this receiver is sealed and end user battery replacement is not possible. Additionally the ""tongue"" where one side of the collar strap mounts broke as well. I used some epoxy to repair, but if better made this would not have happened. So here I am needing to spend $100+ to replace a component that should be serviceable to some level. Not too happy about it.Regarding the training remote, I tried using this part of the system but gave up shortly after it didn't live up to expectations. My two complaints: 1 - the battery on my original unit died very quickly....within days of light usage 2 - The remote had a distinct lag from when the correction button was pushed to when the actual correction was administered. Very frustrating and confusing for both pet and owner. I called Innotek and they sent a replacement. The very polite and accommodating customer service rep pretty much acknowledged these as known issues. Unfortunately, the new remote performed as poorly as the first.All-in-all if the quality were a bit higher and the collar battery was user replaceable I'd be much happier with the containment part of the system.If I were to advise someone on which system to purchase it would be this containment system, less the remote trainer. Which I believe is the the IUC-4100."

Formaldehyde is used as a cheap preservative in shampoos and conditioners, liquid soaps. Formaldehyde is also used in enbalming the dead. It is not healthy for a live person's skin, so why would it be healthy for your pet?"
143372,0,"The tent is incredibly big, I own a fairly small litter tray for my kitty, and well, it ocupies about a third of the tent itself.It makes a fairly good job at keeping odors under control and keeping sand contained. Depending on your cat's sloppyness you'll have to clean it about once every week.It has a very tall top, and putting it together is rather tough, you have to pull tightly for the top cover to fit with the zipper at the bottom cover. Besides that, it is worth the money and the wait."
192395,0,I bought this with the hope of getting something that would give my dog a challenge in getting the treat out. It took her all of 5-7 min before she had it out! Either she was very smart at figuring it out or this was just too easy. The concept is wonderful though and for a smaller dog it would probably be great.
141473,2,"I purchased the Lucky Dog 5 x 15 foot weatherguard Kennel Roof System less than a year ago from Atwoods and the tarp is disintegrating. It is shedding small silver flakes all over the place and has developed a large tear. This cover is in an open area that is not exposed to falling limbs or excessive pine straw, just a lot of hot Arkansas sun. I am very disappointed in this tarp because I have car covers, boat covers, motorcycle covers, propane grill covers, etc. that are several years old and they are holding up fine. This tarp didn't even last a year. I like the kennel, it wasn't to difficult to put together and it gives you the option of 5 x 15 feet or 10 x 10 feet. But I do not recommend this cover. You can purchase a much cheaper tarp that will hold up for several years."
165973,0,"If you are walking a dog that walks faster than you, the only way to stop the leash from going out further is to hold the button down or grab the belt part.

Expensive leash that does not last long before knots appear and you have to manually stop your dog or hold the button down to stop the leash from extending."

165807,2,The bag has no support on the bottom so your dog practically gets involuntarily curled into a ball If it was a young dog it would be ok I guess but my dog being older I don't want to put that much stress on her spine also I could see that she was not comfortable. I have a little French poodle by the way. You can see from the picture the bag is not rigid at the bottom but the dog looks like he is sitting quite happily and my dog was not like that she was all curled up and was uncomfortably trying to sit or get out

I tried the long handled brush on my cats today for the first time and all in all it went fairly well, considering. I bought 3 other brushes, and this brush is the second softest brush, but it is more maneuverable than my first choice (silicone human baby finger brush). So for now this brush seems to serve the purpose. Only time will tell if going through all this hassle is really doing the job it's suppose to do as far as clearing up my cats' beginnings of gingivitis.The finger brush of this kit seems too stiff and awkward to wear on the finger - also there is a piece of rigid rubber sticking out at the base of it, which would probably get in the way of things and I can't imagine it's purpose. So this brush will probably end up in the trash."
35248,1,"I bought this feeder in a rush right before I was going on vacation. I'd completely forgotten about how I was going to feed my fish for 11 days while I was away and I made the decision almost solely on cost and how fast it could be shipped (Amazon Prime). I went out on a limb with this selection because I was looking for a pond feeder, but not willing to pay over $100 for a typical one. While this labeled as an aquarium feeder, I wasn't sure how it would work out. Once I got the feeder in, I rigged a setup for it to be suspended over the pond, and the rest is history. It worked out perfectly. I have 7 good size Koi to feed and the feeder allowed for great flexibility (how many times a day to feed, and adjustable levels of how much to feed)."

It's plastic and a small piece broke off and my 8 week old kitten could have eaten it! I went back to the pet supply store and they replaced the item for one of Li'l Pals other types of cat collars. It's stretchy with a Metal clasp and completely adjustable. I recommend that one!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR PUT YOUR PETS IN JEOPARDY BY PURCHASING THIS ITEM."
209902,2,"I got this pen for two of my cats. I wanted something that would allow them to be outside but safe and secure. This looked like just the ticket. However, in practice, it fell short of the mark for me.PROS- great ventilation- easy to unfold; pops right into place- length makes it easy for several cats to be inside- several zippered openings make it easier to get cats in and out- stakes included for securing to the groundCONS- although it is long, the top slopes down, so the only place the cats can stand up is in the very middle- needs a pad or pan if putting on a hard sufrace such as a deck or concrete rather than on the earth/lawn- cannot use pins to secure on a hard surface; ends curl up and pen tips over unless weights are placed at each end, which reduces interior space further- cats repeatedly got their claws stuck in the mesh -- don't leave your cats unattended- virtually impossible to re-fold and store- when another cat wandered into the yard, they lashed out and tipped the whole thing over, despite the stakes in the grassThe idea is great, but just didn't work for my needs. I'll be looking at a larger stand-up wire crate with a solid bottom and shelves -- which I didn't want to spend the money on to begin with. I think they'll be happier in a more solid enclosure with more room to jump and move around."
73678,0,Is vinyl is supposed to smell incredibly bad?I was originally planning on keeping this rolled up into my dogs day pack but the smell is so bad that I don't want to risk having the day pack smell as bad as this rain jacket.I washed the jacket and it didn't help.I'm only keeping it as an emergency item for fast lunch breaks while it's pouring outside.

135839,1,I moved my dog out east from a dry western climate. Her joints (along with mine) started acting up due to what I and my vet believe to be due to the Barometric pressure change. Read about this stuff on a blog and decided to try it after reading the reviews on here. This stuff really is a miracle joint cure for older dogs (mine is almost 8). She's now running around like a puppy. I actually feel I might have to cut down on her dose so I can keep up with her. Just kidding :) Highly recommend if you want your dog to live comfortably for long. I hardly ever write reviews but had to on this.
93049,1,This is a very handsome warm coat. I bought the xs for my Chihuahua. My only problem with it is the Velco is not the most powerful and somtimes comes undone.
161249,0,I have had this product for 9 months and use it at least 1 x everyday. The only feature I feel could use some improvement is the clasp. The way the carrier clips onto a O ring is fine. It is the getting it back off to refill the carrier with new bags that I found a little too difficult or complicated. If you have it clipped to a treat bag or something similar it tends to hit your leg as you are walking along. I suppose you could clip it to a leash as well? But overall considering the price and everything together it does a fine job. I have no major complaints.

We carried duct tape with us on the airplane just to hold the carrier together long enough for one flight. In frustration, I dropped $125 on this carrier, and amazingly enough, it held beautifully!However, the carrier has some issues. Although it is soft, it's firmer than other soft carriers, and it really didn't fit under the seat in front of us. We were actually lucky that the flight attendents didn't say anything. In addition, and a bit more worrisome, I truly do not believe that the carrier has enough ventilation. Our dog was dripping with sweat when we took him out of the carrier and he was panting so har in the carrier that the whole bag was shaking. You'll notice that there is very little netting on the bag, and where there is, it's a double layer and it's so fine (that's why the dog couldn't claw out) that it's really questionable as to how much air gets through it."

9922,0,"I generally trailer my dog to a nearby shared use path, using a Croozer dog trailer, then she runs with my bike using the Springer Dog Jogger until she has been exercised (1-3 miles) and then she gets back in the trailer. Anyone using the Springer Jogger to exercise your dog must note that except for the spring (S-tube) and plastic ""safety release"" breakaway attachment that the rest of the kit is garbage. I had to replace the joke-of-a-harness with a store-bought one, discard the harness clip for a carabiner, and had to buy a separate bike seat post and use an automotive adhesive (my husband's smart idea) to glue the seat post to the insert and the insert to the clamp that attaches to the S-tube; this keeps the clamp from swiveling which it will do.Note that you will need to spend an additional 20.00 for a designated seat post, whatever the glue costs, 5.00 for a carabiner (I use one with a screwgate/lock), and 25.00 for a new harness (reflective for safety). I also bought reflective climbing cord from REI for safety and so I could adjust the cord length; this replaces the short piece of cord that comes with the Jogger.My setup now works GREAT. Just note that you will need an additional 50.00 - 75.00 to get to this point."
164497,0,"The construction of this item is really pretty nice. That isn't my problem....it is that the photo shows a dog going down the 3-step product, so it looks just right. Not.I have a Shih Tzu and a Terrier. Neither one likes using this because the steps are too tall for them, and then the step itself is too narrow. It is hard for either one to get up or down, and both are uncomfortable. If they would make the steps shorter and wider it would be a super, super good product. As it is, as far as my dogs go, it isn't appropriate for them"

Our problem is over for now because it's winter in NY, but I am thankful I bought the trap and refills and will have it for spring, summer and fall. I should also mention it's very easy to use, and there is no odor, it just simply attracts the fleas and they are killed on the sticky circle inside the trap."

20589,1,"Our small dog loves this toy. Or, maybe he hates it. I can't tell because he goes nuts when I let him play with it. He wears himself out throwing it, chasing it, and activating Mr. Dogg. I can't tell if he's trying to rip Snoop out of it, or whether he can't get enough of him.As many times as I've heard ""Bow wow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay,"" it is not annoying. I don't know how long this toy will last, but it doesn't matter. I am absolutely amazed and thoroughly entertained watching our dog play with this thing. It does seem that supervision is important, since a dog might eventually shred this and eat the chip. So, I limit play and watch while the dog gets a great workout, and I get a really entertaining show.Update. Snoop no longer with us.On the day it was reported that the Australia's Minister of Immigration canceled Snoop's visa, I discovered that our dog had also canceled Mr. Dogg. The exterior of this toy has held up perfectly, but the interior Snoop has been reduced to a rattling, yet otherwise silent, artifact. Still, 5 stars for a great performance while it lasted."

45478,0,"My dogs lets say...aren't the most cooperative bunch. My fiance and I have probably spent over a hundred dollars on different types of leashes and slip leads trying to find out what works best for them. Both my dogs have a tendency to try and lead us on walks, so as a last resort I tried this.Fitting:As soon as we got them we tried them on both our dogs and our older dog took to it okay, he was really scared of it at first. Our youngest one however had a holy fit and started rolling around even did a back flip trying to get it off. The video DVD that came with it said that if your dog does this to adjust the lead as it may be uncomfortable for the dog. After the adjustment he was perfectly fine. One thing is, I went with a size smaller than what I would normally get for a harness or a collar. My older dog wears a medium in harnesses and collars but for this I got him a small and it fit perfectly. Same with our younger dog. He usually wears a small and I went with the petite.Walking:We too both our dogs to the park. Our older dog still managed to get ahead of us, but with a light tug on the lead he seemed to fall back in line. Our younger dog did better on it, not sure if its just hes more impressionable or what. Three days later our older dog is back to pulling at his leash again and not walking in line with us, even when we give him a tug and gorge him with treats.Overall feelings:This is probably a great product if you already have a dog that just needs a little extra guidance but its definitely not going to substitute taking your dog to a obedience class (ours are already set up to go but we wanted to try this in the meantime). The DVD video that comes with it makes it seem like your dog is going to make a miraculous change but if you notice a lot of the dogs are sitting with trainers."
75496,2,It does a good job keeping out the squirrels but it also keeps out the birds. because of that I dont recomend it.
31094,1,"We have a Schnauzer that has separation anxiety and, in general, is a hyper dog. He has had the collar on for one month today and during this month he has only peed on the floor three times and has settled down considerably.

I have just purchased a second collar and hope that this one will be the one to break him of his separation problems."

I was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when I opened the can....I scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry....and she sniffed it and walked away. She does seem to like the Merrick BG dry food. I chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner."
47559,1,I am very pleased with my purchase. It was a gift for my step-daughter. It works perfectly as an add on to the original cage that we purchased.
197942,0,"I usually buy the smaller version for my heavy chewing dog. I bought this larger one for her on Christmas and she had ruined it in about 10 minutes. She is a medium sized dog, but she was able to get more access in the larger openings to chew and bend them. I had to throw it away that night because I didn't want her cutting herself on the sharp edges or swallowing any pieces. I'm sure this would be fine for a larger dog who doesn't chew quite as much. I'll stick with the smaller version now. She's never broken the one she has."
190384,1,"I bought this for my African grey. He is a plucker so I was very worried about him staying warm. After about two weeks of Grey scrutiny He is now much warmer. Please for those with large parrots or ones that are deconstructive. Get some plexie glass attach to outside of cage, drill hole in plexi to run the cord through it. That might keep them from grabbing the wire. It is plastic so it does not have the traction a regular perch does, but its well worth the try for the warmth. I would love to see these inbedded in a concrete perch."
73346,1,"I've had the Robot now for about a year and it has been terrific. The cat likes it and uses it and I like that I don't have to touch anything or get any dust in my lungs from cleaning and adding fresh litter.So far the mechanics have performed nicely, the unit is quiet and relatively easy to maintain."
159026,2,This was yet another of many attempts to get my medium-sized dog to stop pulling. He absolutely hated it and refused to go anywhere. It was like an episode of crocodile hunters- he was on the ground spinning and tangling in it to get it off. The part that goes over his muzzle was irritating his skin as well. I went with another no-pull leash-- the one with the hook on the chest and one strap goes under the front legs. That one works WONDERS if you can find it. This one is too difficult to get adjusted to.
156779,0,"The concept is neat, but I couldn't adjust the toy to let the treats out correctly. Either nothing came out or all the treats came out at once. I have other treat and food dispencing toys that are more user friendly."
15746,0,"Got this collar for training my 100lb rottie. I had previously trained him using my friends very nice and very expensive shock collar. I could not afford to spend $200+ on a collar so I opted to purchase this one.My review may be a little unfair since my comparison is to the more expensive one I used previously. Function wise, as far as administering enough shock to get my large stubborn dogs attention it works great. The difference I noticed was there was some inconsistency in the signal transfer from the remote to the collar even at short distances of 10 to 15 feet away for tone and shock. Also, the shock button would stick at times if pushed with any force resulting in continually shocks being given to my dog. Not a very effective way to properly train a dog.At first I was ready to return the collar after this happened. But I worked with it some (while not on my dog) and discovered that the shock button doesn't stick if it is pushed without significant force.Bottom line, you get what you pay for. Compared to the more expensive collars, I have found that the more expensive collar are made much better, the collar and remote are just nicer, but this collar can get the job done."
212875,1,I love this ship. It is very colorful and still somewhat natural. My fish love that they have a place to hide. Wish it were taller though for my 50 gallon tank. Don't regret the purchase and it adds pop to the tank while still being a usable piece of art.
34858,0,Have had this for over a year now. Works ok. Like other reviews have said the bars that extend across do not stay in place but a little super glue or tape can fix that right away. So for the price I was satisfied even with having to make a small modification to get the bars that go across to stay in place.
41797,0,"I don't particularly care for this particular seller, however. Delivery was SLOOOOOOOW.My cat loves these treats but she tends to scarf them, pretty much negating the point of them. I don't buy them for her too often any more since they don't do anything for her teeth if she swallows them whole.It would be helpful if they were somewhat larger. I give her Science Diet dental dry food now, instead."
542,2,I got this toy (size large) to keep my 25lb corgi/sheltie foster dog busy in his crate post-neuter. 10 minutes in he was ripping chunks of rubber off like it was nothing. He is NOT an aggressive chewer by any means and actually uses a puppy kong because he's such a mild chewer. I figured something like this would be okay but not even close. I'm glad I found it on sale because if it'd cost me the full price I'd be really sad.If it didn't withstand the chewing of a very mild chewer who is less than 25lbs it shoudln't be given to any moderate or heavy chewers... MUCH to my dismay.
192349,0,"This toy was highly recommended by my trainer, so I thought I'd give it a try, desperate to find anything to keep my ""little"" guy (70+ lb Lab mix puppy) and my adult German Shepherd busy for more than a couple minutes. The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later. I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble). Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well. Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits. While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great."

It seems to be a decent filter for my 55 gallon tank, but I like having lots of small fish (from tetras to swordtails) and it sucked up dozens of them. Needless to say all of the fish and about 5 frogs were killed. I tried making a screen for the intake with both fabric and metal, but they got really messy and I gave up. I also tried adjusting the flow to a very low setting, but then my tank didn't get clean enough. I'm currently looking for a different filter with a built in screen."
58880,2,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. The item arrived in great shape and on time. HOWEVER, it is a large item and only filled 1/2 of the ridiculously large box it was shipped in. The other half of the box was filled with smaller empty boxes, paper, and random packing materials. I had the task of disposing of the enormous shipping box, plus 4 other boxes and paper.....not too happy. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM PETCO AGAIN IF THEY CAN'T APPROPRIATELY PACKAGE ITEMS. I also wonder how much my considerable shipping fee paid for the shipment of empty boxes which then I got to pay to dispose of."
196787,0,"I have a 4.5 lb chihuahua and this was very roomy for him. I wanted a sturdy carrier that would be comfortable for my dog and me, something that would be easy to carry through airports, and not look like a ""dog carrier"". Here are some things I've noticed after multiple air and ground travel with this carrier.1. My husband and I flew with this bag and it did not meet the size requirement for one portion of our flight. It was a small plane headed into Aspen, CO and the length was 1.5"" longer than the requirement. The people at the counter didn't bother measuring so it wasn't an issue for us, but I was a little stressed that they would reject the carrier. On one of our flights, for some reason, it was somewhat difficult to get the carrier down into the feet area so that you can push it under the seat in front of you. I had to squish the carrier to get it down into that area. I'm sure my dog didn't appreciate being rolled around in the crate so I could get him under the seat.2. While walking through the airport, it was a little cumbersome for me to carry. The strap seemed a little too short for me to carry it cross body, so it was always on one shoulder (I'm 5'10""). I didn't feel all that secure about it not falling off my shoulder. I wish this bag came in a smaller size, especially lengthwise. I think that might have helped the cumbersome feeling.3. For car rides, I feed the seat belt through one of the side handles. It seemed to work well, except now there is a depression where the seat belt creates tension. It's like the sides are caving in. I wish there was some sort of metal brace that goes across the two handles. Like someone else on here mentioned, it would be nice to have two handles on the sides of this bag so you can carry it like a duffel bag. It tends to wobble when you pick it up with the shoulder strap and it is not a secure way to carry it.4. The one side opening is too low for my dog to crawl into. That opening might have been designed with the intention of letting people check on their pets during flight, not as a door, but I wanted something that could function as a crate once we got to our destination. Yes, the top can be left open, but some dogs like to be enclosed. I thought about turning it on its side, but it was too narrow and I wanted him to be able to stretch out. I took the padded lining to make more room, but still the opening is a little low.5. I also wish this carrier had one of those open sleeves on one side (since there is nothing there anyway), that you could slide your rolling luggage handle through for transport through the airport. I tried to wrap the handle around the luggage handle, but it kept sliding off. Seems like this would be a simple fix that would make a significant improvement in the design. It's a little much to rush around in crowded airports with a purse, this carrier on my shoulder that didn't feel all that secure on my shoulder, and a rolling luggage.Still, the quality of this carrier is excellent. Just a few minor tweaks and it would be perfect. I don't regret buying this carrier, but it didn't live up to all my expectations. I'm buying another carrier that has wheels and a telescoping handle, just like regular luggage, and can be converted to a backpack."
101558,0,"I ordered this Phoshate test product some months ago - Actually, you might like to know that this thing is made for little tropical fish tanks. I use the word, ""little"" fish tanks - as compared to a ""swimming pools"".For some reason, this stuff can't be found in 'Pool Supply' stores in most of So. Florida - so, I'll try the fish tank stuff - mind you, this is only a 'test' kit, not a remedy. If you find phosphate in your pool water, then you're going to have to buy some pretty expensive pool stuff to remedy the problem.In the past year Phosphate seem to have become a problem in residential swimming pools in our area. I hope I'm not starting something here - fish tank stuff is largely reasonable in price compaired to swimming pool supplies. If the producer of this stuff discovers the swimming pool market I fear what will happen to the price of his kits - get the picture?.I hope that the Phosphate problem in pools is not [also] connected to Globle Warming. I'll have to work extra hard to try and make the connection on that one."
53387,0,"i bought this initially for my 12 lb terrier's travel fear. This calms him, but he would still puke in the car. So, I decided to try to use this for his separation anxiety instead, and it works quite well. Instead of howling for hours home alone, he chills out most of the time instead.UPDATE: This doesn't seem to work consistently. It will work one day, but not the next day, and might work 3 days later. I don't really get it."
53713,0,I bought this at IKEA a few years ago for $7.50. It took my cat six months or more to start using it--I think she was freaked out by the smell. It's a pretty nice tent though...my cat sleeps in it all the time. I put a heated cat bed in there and a blanket over it for the winter (I don't turn on the heat since I live in Oakland.) People who list this for $50 or $100 are completely insane.
100786,2,"My dog is a chewer and also loves playing by himself with various balls, rolling and tossing then chasing them. Not this ball. He scoped it out when I first gave it to him but hasn't touched it since. Maybe because it smells so unnatural. This ball really reeks."
24667,0,"The concept is great. It took a couple days for my cats to get used to (they were a little afraid of the bubbles at first, so it was nice that I can adjust the bubbling level). But they're drinking from it now, and I'm glad to have fresh water for them all the time.But my beef is, it is overpriced. The first one I bought was broken (cheap plastic). I had to take apart the second one to get it to work. And I discovered it is nothing more than an overpriced aquarium bubbler. Unless you're looking for something with a large reservoir, just buy your own pump and secure it to the bowl."
144160,2,"This filter does a pretty good job keeping a turtle tank clean but the attaching hardware is unreliable and flimsy and these flaws have turned out to be very costly...CONS:1) The plastic piping is thin and has cracked in multiple places. Luckily it was easy to find replacement parts but they were not cheap!2) The plastic hoses that connect the filter to the inlet/outlet pipes are also pretty weak. If the outlet hose is bent a little, the hose will collapse in on itself into a kink and cut off water flow... luckily this hasn't fried the motor, yet... Also, the plastic hoses are really hard to clean! I haven't found a pipe cleaner that's 3 feet long so I usually wrap a paper towel around the dull end of one of my husband's spear gun spears and run it through the hoses... obviously not a very good solution!And worst of all...4) The plastic piping pieces go together by fitting one into the other (no threads, no adhesive.. just insert and hope it stays together). This might be okay if you are using the filter for fish, but if you have a turtle, beware! My turtle knocks the piping pieces off ALL the time. Usually she will knock the inlet pipes off and the filter will fill with air (luckily this hasn't fried the motor, yet..). However, just yesterday (while we were at work of course) she knocked the outlet pipes off the outlet hose and the hose emptied the entire tank (50 gal) onto our wood floors... I bought a dehumidifier ($250 yikes) to pull the moisture out of the room but the floors are totally warped. The filter motor might be fried now... I am a little too frustrated to test it out...But, there aren't too many decent filters in this price range.. So, next time I hook up this filter I will be using duct tape on the tubes..."
102963,1,This scratching post just begs to be scratched. It's great looking (not that that matters to my feline friends) and the cats are drawn to it. It is large and sturdy - no rocking around while the kitties lock the claws down!I also bought the slide-on seat that sits on top and the cats enjoy sitting on their little perch.

123961,1,"We bought the Fluval 305 to replace a Fluval 203 that we'd had for about 11 years. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a 10-minute set up. However, we encountered two unexpected difficulties, one minor and one more significant. The minor: the intake/output hoses are a single hose that users need to measure and cut to fit their own tank setups. Not a big deal for us but not what we were expecting based on our prior Fluval filter and definitely would be a problem for anyone for whom the distance from canister top to aquarium top is more than 3.75-4.0 feet. The more significant: the pump primer is very flimsy and, at least in our case, was not up to the task of creating enough suction to start the gravity-aided flow of water. Because of the large diameter of the intake/output hoses, neither was the suction bulb we used to use with the Fluval 203. However, it took hours of troubleshooting to ID the problem, in part because the hoses are opaque, making it impossible to see how high in the hoses the water is getting with the pump primer. Even then, after phone calls to the vendor and to Fluval, the best solution anyone could offer was to suck on the end of the output hose to get the flow of water started. Yuck. I did it this time, but I hope to find another way of creating sufficient suction by the time of our first filter change. That said, the filter is quiet and nicely engineered despite these problems, which is why I still gave it 4 stars."
174609,0,I expected the bubbles to be of more varied size but all of the bubbles this thing emits are super tiny 'fizzy' bubbles.I was hoping for larger bubbles like some of the bubble stones that I own. no such luck.
111821,1,"I have a stray Tuxedo cat that found us that needs to gain some weight. He is on the skinny side and is sensitive at times to the food we feed our kitties - this sensitivity comes in the form of vomiting. I bought this product to ensure that Tuxedo Joe was getting a higher caloric intake and proper vitamins.Ounce for ounce, this is a good option for caloric intake. The reason for 4 stars is the greasy, oily formula. This formula is very similar to the products used for hairballs and I know that it could be done differently -- similar toNutri-Vet Pet-Ease Paw-Gel for Cats, 3-Ouncewhich my kitties find easier to get off the spoon, paw or finger. Think of the Nutri-Vet as a cream and the Nutri-Cal as an ointment. This ointment quality makes me think that kitty is getting the junk stuck on the roof of his mouth. It would be like me getting peanut butter stuck on the roof of my mouth.Despite this, this is the only product of it's type that I have found and I will continue to use it in hopes that it will provide more calories and weight gain for our little Tuxedo cat. This product does is well-tolerated with out kitty and he has had not issues."
70518,1,"Our dog who came to us as a stray loves this toy.She loves plush toys generally, but this one especially. She has destoyed lesser toys in a day. This one has lasted two years. We are on our second now. I would buy more toys of this quality for her in a minute, very few can match this for play value and durability. We will always try to have another on hand for her, as I'd hate to see her be without ""hedgehog"". She also really likes the little one ""hedgette"" but she misplaces it more easily. Plush Puppies make more like these please."
18645,0,"After purchasing several Kong Material stuffed animals and seeing that my little 7lb puppy couldn't rip them apart, I expanded and purchased most of their other stuffed toys in size small. This one isn't my favorite. I think the material is just too plush. Kong also uses a fleece material for their other toys, and I feel that maybe they should have done the same for this one. Definitely sturdy though!"
63987,0,"I have had several Lupine collars and the product is absolutely the best there is. These can't be destroyed!! The colors stay sharp and it doesn't fray no matter what you do to it (and we're pretty harsh on our dog stuff around here).My ONLY complaint is that this collar doesn't have a 'click' buckle to open and close the collar, it has to be slipped over the dog's head. Kennels do not accept these types of collars and they're not ideal for dogs with great big heads (like mine). I assumed all Lupines had buckles on them and didn't even think to look more closely!!"
73445,2,"I purchased this in 2010. It's a great idea but the actual product has been nothing but headaches. The first unit we got would spin and spin and never stop. The company replaced it. That was nice except for the hassle of shipping back a giant used litter box. The new unit worked okay for awhile but soon enough it developed the same problem. Sometimes it stops upside down. That means the cats can't use it so they use the floor instead. At this point we've replaced the ball, the base and the whole unit once each. We clean the unit as directed and our cats are average sized and use the unit appropriately. Consider why the company has enough ""refurbished"" inventory to be able to offer them as an option.Overall I would advise you to consider the price of the unit prorated against the warranty period. Then consider the hassle of getting repair or replacement service even if it's covered. Then consider that the company is very slow to respond. If you have the money to purchase a back-up in case of malfunction, then I'd say you should go for it. Not having 700 bucks to shell out for litter boxes, we'll be returning to a traditional litter pan."
183171,0,"This toy, while sturdy for the average dog, is not good for aggressive chewers. I have a pit bull and an American Bulldog. Both of them tore it apart right away. They took all the stuffing out. I think this toy would be good for dogs who are not aggressive chewers. It's the best tug toy I have found though so I will give them 3 stars."
89890,1,"This item arrived on time and well packaged with no damage. This water and food bowl is aesthetically appealing and very solid. It looks like a great deal of r and d went into the development. It is up off of the floor for ease of access and the serving bowls are firmly in place so your pet can not shift the contents around causing spillage. Lastly, the bowls can be lifted out for easy cleaning. Thanks Our Pets!"
178007,0,"My unit arrived with no documentation, no screws, and the bottom (carpeted) section has a strong smell that probably will have a bad effect on your cat...may not be healthy, either. Comes in two pieces. I used a rubber hammer to force the base to the top section, then found thee screws of my own that fit the slots. After that, I put in a towel for added comfort and to try to reduce the processed smell (which is awful). My recommendation is to get some screws and not rely on the snaps. Also, leave it out in the cold for a few days and hopefully the smell will siphon off. The size is great for two cats, but is optimum for one. Screws take some elbow grease to screw in, but it's not a bad job. Still, they should have come with the unit."
147147,0,"This cat door worked well. We have it going between our garage and the kitchen. I was glad to be able to move the litter box into the garage so now the bathroom doesn't have cat litter all over the floor and she can come in and out as she pleases. Recently though, at night, we started locking the cat in the garage because she wants to play at 2 am and makes a lot of noise in trying to get our attention: yowling, playing with her toys, jumping on the bed to wake us up, etc. (She has always done this, and we just put up with the interruptions until recently, when we had a baby and are too sleep deprived to put up with yet another creature waking us up in the middle of the night).Unfortunately, she quickly (within a few days) learned how to unlatch the lock mechanism from the garage side of the cat door. So now, on top of locking her in there (with food and water, of course), we have to put a crate of books in front of the cat door on the kitchen side so that once she does unlatch the lock, she still can't fully open the door and get into the house. I wish I would have purchased the kind with the extra door piece that slides over the flap instead. This is just not cat proofed enough. :(If you have a dumber cat, or one that isn't so inclined to do so much work (lazier than ours), then you should be fine."
96503,1,This is an excellent buy for minimal money. I saw others similar but for twice the money. Delivered quickly as well.
200277,1,"We purchased the FURminator for our son and daughter-in-law's dog, a Yellow Lab, who sheds and sheds and sheds. After being brushed with the FURminater several days in a row, the shedding is considerable less. The dog likes to be brushed with the FURminator and after the initial brushing every day, you only need to do it every couple of days and there is a significant decrese in the shedding. We highly recommend the FURminator to anyone with a dog who sheds. We adopted a small Pomeranian mix dog, and he sheds a little, not like the Yellow Lab, non-the-less he sheds. We then bought the smaller FURminator and it works well on our Pomeranian."
171974,2,"This is a worthless item. I bought it a couple of months ago and stopped using it within a week. Yes, it is absolutely adorable, but at the end of the day it doesn't work. When I tried to scoop up the poop it smeared into the rake area and made a mess. It was hot that first time it happened so needless to say I was quite irritated. The next times were no better. Unless the poop is dried all the way through it will not scoop it well.The larger pooper scooper that I bought off of Amazon is a PetCo that works perfectly. It is a simple scooper with no rake or snap back affect. This purple one is leaning against my fence being decorative along side the cute waste basket. I am back to using the bags in the small area that this scooper was bought to handle. The PetCo scooper is in the larger area of the yard. I won't buy another cute non-functional item again. A waste of time and money."
173352,1,"I received this Hidden Litter Box today in the mail. I read a lot of reviews before buying it to make sure, because of the cost. This Hidden Litter Box was worth buying. There were complaints about problems with the upper part fitting the lower part, but I think the company must have heard complaints because mine was easy to put together. The top sits on a ridge on the bottom half. The body itself is worth the money because it does look like a planter. Problems with this item are the moss and the fake green plant. I don't like the moss, but another reviewer said he replaced it with rocks and that is what I did because it looks better. Also the plant looks like total crap. It came with the leaves looking cheap and bent. I have seen alot of fake silk plants and this particular plant is pathetic for the price we are asked to pay for it. I actually tried to use an iron and steam on it to make the leaves look decent and gave up because it was too much of a problem to fix. I am going to a craft store and buying a fake plant to put in it which is what I sugguest to whoever else wants to buy this item. You can go on EBAY, a pet store or to a hobby store and buy rocks to put in the planter and buy what ever fake plant you want for the planter and then it would look real and fantastic. Presently I am using the orginal green plant in the planter and have it in a corner of my room. I have the entrance of the condo facing the corner with enough space for the cat to whip in and do her business. I also put a piece of carpet under the condo to catch the litter that comes out with the cat. I have actually had people sitting right next to the condo and they didn't believe me when I told them it was a litter box. They thought it was a real plant. The problems are simple to fix with this item. So I do suggest buying it for people who do not want to see a litter box, but if you want it to look real, you need to replace the moss and plant which is easy to do."

189375,0,"based on the sizing on the site we ordered a small for our 8 lb chihuahua.. but it was still too small. Our little girl is a bit muscular, so it didnt fit around her chest. - we ended up giving it away. :(Super cute though and made very well! Just wish it had fit!"
60057,0,"Slightly annoyed that the packaging pictured for this flea and tick product was different than what I received in the mail. The packaging on amazon displayed the product in lbs, which would be distributed in the US obviously. The packaging I received referred to the dog's weight in kilograms and clearly not packaged for the United States. It appears to be what is sold in Australia. Hope it's an authentic Merial product that kills the fleas, but not my dog."
188420,2,"On Sept. 11, 2012, this food was recalled for possible salmonella! Please do not endanger your pups.

The recall was the first thing that came up.[...]"
181613,2,"I got this in a lightning deal around the holidays and it's now $1 more than the ""deal"". I'm not saying that's bad, but it just doesn't seem very normal (or common).Regardless, I overpaid. I got the small pad because I'm tired of my cat insisting to sleep in my bed and resist whenever I try to move her over to give me soon room.She likes the warmth, that's what the star is for.The rest is disappointing. First of all, my cat is not fat, but she is longer. As a result, this pad is too small for her. Unless she is curled up in a tight ball, it's not big enough. Could I have measured? Yes, I could have. Then again, since people are buying larges for their great dane's, I figured the small would work for a moderately sized feline.Also, it is an air mattress. That's not horrible, but it's not very clear from the description. What is horrible is since the pad is so darn small the air mattress isn't very flat. If you have any real amount of air in it, it sort of takes a ""balloon"" shape. This makes the cat fall off the side due to the curvature. I think sometimes this makes her think, ""oh to heck with it,"" and lays somewhere colder.Lastly, the product does ""appear"" to be built safely, and I'm thankful for that. However, the instructions have spelling and grammar errors all over the place-- the kind of thing I've seen written to accompany knock-off products product in China on the cheap.Overall, this may not be the absolute worst heating pad ever made, but I struggle to think it deserves two solid stars. Consequently, I offer my rare 1-star rating."

74736,0,"I want to give this 5 stars because it's the only toy in which my recently adopted, timid rescue dog has showed any interest.I want to give this 1 star because an older bichon was able to power through a good 1/3 of the clear bone in under 3 hours.A little disclaimer, the dog on whom this review is based is a 15 lb. bichon. She was rescued from a really sad situation which made estimating her age particularly difficult, but she's definitely not a puppy and it's likely she's approaching senior status if she's not there already. Point being she's not a strong healthy puppy in her chewing prime, yet she gnawed right through the clear bone from this pack within a few hours. The packaging (and any research into the product's safety) says to throw these out if more than a small piece comes off. When I lived at home with my parents, we gave these to our dachshunds and they lasted weeks. I didn't want to startle my new adoptee while she was appearing to enjoy herself so I let her go at her bone for a bit before I felt the need to see what kind of damage (expecting none) she had done. I was surprised and a little panicky to see that the nubby ends from both sides of the bone were completely gone and she was well on her way to getting one end fashioned into a pointy shiv-like shape. This was almost two days ago and she hasn't shown any signs of digestive issues, so hopefully we dodged a bullet there.I'm giving it 3 stars because she loved it and it's my own fault for not watching her more closely the entire time to ensure she wasn't eating it, but still, I wouldn't be a huge fan of any non-free toy she can completely destroy in no time even if it didn't carry the safety concerns. I'm going to go up to a bigger size - only because I was so happy to see her respond to something besides her dog bed and food - and see if that makes a difference. If anyone has had experience with toys for timid dogs who never learned how to play and has any suggestions, I would be happy to hear them. She clearly likes to chew. She's so-so about her KONG. She seems to like watching her Cuz bounce, but that's about it. No interest whatsoever in rope toys, squeaky toys or plush toys."
