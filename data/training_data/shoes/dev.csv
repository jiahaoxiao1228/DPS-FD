336432,1,"I work at UPS as a part-time preloader. I'm on my feet for four hours and so I needed a work shoe that was both durable and comfortable. These boots provide just that and hold up to taking a beating. I feel these boots offer some ventilation because my feet aren't soaked by the time I get home. The non-slip soles provide excellent firm footing, and although they are soft toe, they hold up to a 110lb package dropped from waist height. In short, these boots make everyday work a cake walk."
83573,0,I was upset when I got these shoes because I needed them to go on vacation and did not have time to order another pair. These shoes run a size small. I wear a size 10 and my heel was hanging off the end about a half in and they were too narrow.
53177,1,This sneakers are just great! They are true size. I am very pleased with my purchase.
173021,0,"I love K-Swiss shoes, I've been wearing them for years, I was disappointed that this styles sizes ran small and narrow."
292685,1,"estos zapatos son realmente bellos y comodos...la flexibilidad, adicionalmente el envio fue realmente rapido y seguro.recomiendo ampliamente la compra de este producto.muchas gracias"
55122,1,"These are tried & true shoes. Color was slightly different than pictured, but I'm quite happy with the order. Shipping was fast!"
203584,2,"What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product? I would have wanted to know if they didn't have the color they showed in the picture, which was Burgundy. If I had known that I would have never ordered it. I am a female and I don't want a black timberland boot. The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady. I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want. I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture, but it didn't work out. You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around. I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible."
4152,1,"I got those shoes today i reckon they look better in the picture. when i were them the flower at the top goes a bit down and the chains are a bit long. they are uncomfortable, specially at the front because of the thin strap but i still LOVE them :)"
216592,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
352879,1,"These are like walking on carpet. Few notes though, I have small but slightly wide feet. I should have gotten the wide. Second, these are actually slippers. My daughter who is 17 wears them out everywhere but when I wore them to work on casual Friday, I was informed many times that they are slippers. I run a lot, so these are absolutely awesome for afterwards and just to wear around the house. Overall, get the wide unless you have really narrow feet and don't plan to wear them out of your home."
344552,0,"I was a little more than disappointed to see ""Made In China"" in these boots (I was led to believe that Justin were all Made in the USA, and that's part of the reason I bought these). In that respect, the product info was misleading.Also; the felt lining in the heel area only lasted a few wearings before it tore and bunched up, so I can't walk very far without feeling like I've got a blister coming on. The black rubber sole just seems cheap, and they feel off-balance (compared to other boots that I own) when I'm walking in them.Overall, I'm disappointed with the manufacturing and quality, but will probably still keep them since I sit at a desk most of the time.If you're going to work or walk in these boots, I don't recommend them."
81382,1,"Why doesn't anybody state that they run full size large? Maybe it's not even worth mentioning as everybody knows that, but I've never had experience with Converse before. I bought those in size 10 (men's) for my brother (he always wears 10) and they are big even for my husband (who wears 11). Other than that they are OK, good quality."
314541,1,I purchased this shoe in white using my normal size and they are a perfect fit and feel as if you are walking on pillows. My feet do not get tired with this shoe. I am going to purchase this shoe in another color.
155754,1,"Initially the item was not delivered to the requested address; since the seller is using the USPS, which is not as efficient as UPS or DHL; however the seller made all efforts to track the item and finally was located in some post office and I have to go my self and collect it.For deliveries, I would suggest to the seller, to use UPS or DHL even if you charge the client the additional cost."
184614,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
321414,0,"Size run's a little big, but we were able to put up with it in regardless. So we kept them."
26652,1,"I'd been very nervous about buying shoes online, but thanks to many of the previous reviewers, I was able to make a good choice on size. I usually wear a size 7 medium in street shoes, but because I'd read that these shoes run narrow, I ordered a 7 wide, and they fit perfect. I was so relieved! I'd been looking for shoes for worship dance, with a heel not too high, but kind of dressy, and I think these are just right!"
30049,1,"I just purchased my 5th pair of Propet Breeze Walkers. I have some severe foot problems post botched bunion surgery, and these sandals are the only shoes that are comfortable all day long for me. The arch is very good and the adjustable straps allow you to adjust to meet your foot needs. Love them."
319914,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
99360,0,"i really love these shoes, they have little star cut outs- and who doesn't want that at your feet?? my only complaint is the strange fit, i have no idea why the back raises up and then bends a little.. almost like it was intentionally made to give you blisters. it's tight too. aughh. :("
69491,1,"We all wear crocs in our family. We just throw them on and out the door we go. What more can you say. This is one of the simplest versions with a good roomy fit (you'll see that some Crocs have a single digit size as in ""size 8"" and others have a size span as in ""size 8-9"") For the kids in the family we always get the ones with the size range as those tend to get the longest wear. And if you go to the Crocs website you can learn how you can recycle your used Crocs (however us adults have been wearing ours for two years already with no wear in sight)"
127176,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
375114,0,"These shoes were for my wife, and I can only tell you what she tells me. She spends 14 hours a day in them as she works at the local hospital, and she's always on her feet, so she needs well made shoes.They are good shoes, and offer good support, BUT the sole liner ALWAYS come out, or shifts it's position in these shoes. These are the third pair she's owned of this brand and style, and this has happened to all of them. Obviously, a design flaw. And, this third pair does pinch in the toe area, even though they are wide.Good shoes, but not the best. She is looking for something better."
120550,1,After wearing 574 for a few years I decided to try the another retro show the 420. While the show is nice looking and flexible. There is very little padding compared to the 574s I have had. I will wear the shoes till they wear out but will go back to 574s for my next shoe.
326854,1,"I've been using the GT-2000 series shoes for about 2+ years now, and I can honestly say, they're the most comfortable running shoes for my build. This is one of Asics best, if not the best, selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types.These shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over-pronator (when the feet roll in too much) with low to medium arches, but I've met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches. I, myself, am flat-footed, but use orthotics. This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit, and these work great. Don't worry if you don't have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time.The heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support. The shoe is designed for medium to large builds, but again, I've come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe. When I first began running, I weighed 300+ pounds, now at 216 pounds, the shoes still work well (I've bought newer version of this shoe as I've worn the others out).The ""Upper"" (the top parts of the shoe) are really comfortable. It's made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot, while allowing all the heat, moisture & sweat out. The shoe is so comfortable, you could easily run in it without socks (which I have done only a few times).The 2000 series are versatile, they're well priced, and they come in a variety of sizes, widths, and colors, so chances are they'll fit you. This is by far the best running shoe I've used up to date, and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting or a long time runner."
282536,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
257988,1,Everyone is always asking where I got these shoes. Absolutely love it and so does all of my friends.
257931,1,I have had this shoe before and I am going to buy it again. It is a very well made shoe.
28368,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
129948,0,"These shoes are very retro and look great with a pair of dark jeans and a blazer for a sort of slightly dressy casual look. However, the arch support inside the shoe is so flat they're a bit uncomfortable to wear for very long. Definitely a shoe for the flat footed."
153358,1,"These are super comfy shoes. I felt like I had just put them on at the end of the day. I like the style, but I think the light blue looks nicer & will likely order them next. No breaking in needed, they fit great out of the box. Highly recommend, esp. if you have to slip in & out of your shoes, like traveling."
140311,1,"My mom is 85 years and its very difficult to find shoes that fit and are comfortable. She is fairly active and wants to look presentable in her day to day activities. This casual shoe is appealing to the eye and is well made and durable. The leather never fades nor ""chips"" off."
315368,1,These shoes are the best. They are so comfortable and really cute. I got the lilac patchwork ones and I wish I had gotten a couple of more colors before they sold out.
43178,1,light and airy but with good soles that do not get shredded if kids walk on pavement or poolside. they cost a bit more but I tired some cheaper ones and the opening was too small for my son's feet and we could not even get them on! I would still prefer if there was a better elastic at the top to stretch more but these work pretty well. My 3 year is picky about how his shoes feel and does not mind these at all. I got our 1st pair last year and got 2 additional sizes this since they were the best we found. His pair from last year I will keep for a siblng or donate- they are in great condition despite a lot of summer wear and swim classes throughout the year!
98231,1,"very comfortable and sturdy slipper, came with the correct size and left and right were correct too and the price is awesome"
35914,1,"These shoes are way hip and since they're hightops, my kid can't kick them off in the carseat! I haven't heard any complaints about comfort from him either. They have held up through two sons and are a little faded from frequent washing, but look all the cooler for it."
25734,1,These are the best sneakers I have owned. They came quickly and in excellent condition. I followed a reviewer's recommendation and ordered them a half size larger and they fit perfectly.
374974,1,"Danner builds boots. Not jacket's or hats or underwear... Just boots, and they do an exceptional job of it. Certainly Danner's are not for everyone, just like a differnt motorcycle helmet manufacturers different brands fit different people. Danner's are narrow by design, and do tend to run a bit on the flat side in the arch. But if they do fit your foot shape, you will never go back to anything else.Acadia's are worn by most of the people who are out there protecting you every day. Fire, police, and military personnel are the people who these boots, and in that task they meet all the requirements those professions demand. I've worn the Acadia since 1996 on my job as a professional firefighter/EMT and though I've tried a few other kinds of boots over the years; I always come back to the Acadia. These boots have seen me through 200 degree ground on wildland fires ( NOTE- these do not meet current wildland specs any longer - boots must be full leather)HAZMAT incidents, and more muddy ditches on motor vehicle accident's than I can count.Are these boots more expensive than a cheap pair of ""tactical"" boots? Yes, but with a pair of Danner boots you get the ability to have them reconditioned, as well as owning a boot that will outlast almost any other on the market, and they are made in the USA in Portland, Oregon. I still wear my original pair I got in '96 for yard work and such. If they fit your foot, you won't be disappointing in spending the extra money to get the best."
363109,1,I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes!
315764,1,They are exactly what I wanted and I'm well pleased. I ordered a wider size than I normally wear (based on advice of several reviewers)and they fit fine. Haven't worn them for any length of time yet so I can't judge them for comfort or wear but I don't anticipate any problems.
382706,1,I love them sooo much! they are super comfy. Im a cali girl- so flip flops are a staple in my wardrobe. and thesea are great!
209184,0,"Came in a timely manner, correct style and size but the color looked different online. Still happy with the color. Very happy with the quality and price!"
197160,1,"Caterpillar boots are all I wear! I'm a pipe fitter so they have to stand up to a harsh environment daily, and they just that! I also would recommend the Endure series boots from Cat. You'll be very pleased if you buy these!"
59210,1,I ordered these boots for a trip to Tasmania. They arrived before the due date and fitted beautifully. For the money these are very good value.
96382,1,This is my 3rd pair in 24 years. That's a fine testimony to their durability. Matterhorn makes great boots IMHO.
387876,1,could not find this size crocs - only here - hubby was happy -love them
279555,1,This is defenitely one great pair of boots! It's very soft and comfortable. I recommed to use it with long socks.
383177,1,very comfortable shoe. I have worn these for many years & have many colors. Good with casual or dressy. I was so happy I found the black again. For a long time they weren't available.
105076,1,"I have a pair of these shoes in brown that I bought some time ago. I love them, although they are getting older now and starting to show smudges and wear. They are still comfortable, but don't look as good as they did. I feel I got my money out of them and am not disappointed at all on their life. They looked great with jeans or dress pants, and are comfortable and well built, although sometimes my friends would tease and call them my ""manly shoes"". The only reason I haven't replaced this particular shoe yet is because I have gotten spoiled with the other Eastland shoes that are slip-ons, where these require lacing. Not to sound lazy, but it is much easier when your hands are full to slip the shoes on or off at the door, rather than lacing in or out. If an oxford is what you are looking for, I would recommend this one without reservation. They are comfortable, solid, and I didn't slip and slide in them in bad weather either."
217152,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
81286,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
379804,1,"I bought these shoes for a choir concert, and ended up standing in them for 5 hours straight. The other singers near me were miserable in their higher heels and different brands, some even ended up slipping their shoes off during the concert. But my feet were happy and I had no foot pain at all the next day. They do run small, like all the reviews indicate. I ended up buying a full size larger than I normally wear. Amazon makes returning things so easy, do like I did and order 2 or 3 sizes all at once, then just ship the ones you don't use back."
366422,0,"I don't write many product reviews, but I thought I'd chip in my two cents to help the next guy. I loved these sandals for their comfort and fit. I wore them on a couple of backpacking trips with 40 lbs on my back tromping through streams along the way, and I never had the slightest hint of a blister on my feet. My review of three stars is four three reasons: First of all, they only lasted about 18 months. Keen has an 12 month warranty, so don't expect them to outlast that by much (my day-to-day use was more sitting in a cubicle than backpacking through wet terrain). Second, they are heavy. These weigh a multiple of your standard flip-flop sandals and probably more than your tennis shoes. Third, and this is probably more me than the shoe, they tend to get very stinky. I don't know if they need a wash out hole in the toe or what, but they tended to build up gunk in the toe and really smell up the house.All in all, I'd buy another pair, but for the price you should be able to expect more durability. They are cheaply glued together and will start the clock to fall apart the moment you put them on your feet."
237321,1,"I really like these shoes! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper. I've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet. But the main problem with my old Asics is they're dorky looking for casual wear. These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I'm not even wearing shoes. Unlike running shoes, these are very thin and offer very little little support. Lots of shoes make my feet look big, but these make my feet look sleek. Workmanship appears good but I don't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin. Normally I wouldn't pay $70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking. If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking, I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape. Granted I don't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are. Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down..."
191035,0,"These shoes are pretty tight, most probably due to the elastic they have put to make it an easy Slip-On.. hopefully it'll be okay after a little bit of use.Otherwise the shoes are very light and comfy.. go ahead and order them :)"
338441,1,"Was very thankful these arrived so soon after ordering,was a last minute item...and my daughter loves them....she now has 2 pairs..and is planning on collecting them for different colors....Thank youShelia Sale/VA"
205726,1,I got these boots when i was working this summer in the woods not ideal for that but they are comfortable especially to wear if your standing on cement a lot.
254100,1,"I've used Converse sneakers for a little over a decade so I knew exactly what size to order, when I got them they were just perfect. Good to get dependable sizing and quality.They're more of a fashion item, in the most relaxed sense of the word, than running shoes.Did not need to contact vendor after placing the order, I got my notification of shipment and the package arrived on the promised date."
206322,1,I got a pair of these Crocks for my grandson and he loves them. They are made well and sized properly.We are all very happy with this purchase
168753,0,I think this will be a great shoe for people who need to wear orthotics. I ordered the wrong size and decided not to get the correct size.
239096,1,Love these shoes! They feel great and fit well - 8W. Perfect for professional events or evenings out. My new favorite dress shoe brand!
171194,1,Easy spirit taveltime slip on shoes are the most comfortable shoe I have worn. This is the second pair I hace had. I will continue to puchase the shoe as long as the price is within my budget.
61286,1,"Bought these for a trip to patagonia last minute. ""broke them in' on the plane ride down and for one day in Buenos Aires and that was enough. Very comfortable and water proof. Great buy"
293909,1,"I got the ""pumice"" color which is a pretty light gray with blue details, not stiped like the black sandal shown. Protection for the big toe, comfortable to wear immediately. Machine washable. I am very happy with these sandals."
301545,1,I have ordered this sandles before. But the service was first class. delivery within days. I will certainly order from this company again
244863,1,"A great shoe, but read the reviews - the boot runs a size too large. Other than the delay and inconvenience, I had no problems returning for a size smaller. Quick ship. Shoe is quality."
359936,1,"I got these to replace some worn out character shoes I use for work, and I LOVE them. I work at a cabaret, and wait tables as well as perform. These shoes are well padded and very comfortable, and hold up well to the hard use I put them through on a daily basis. I ordered them a size larger than what I normally wear, and the fit is perfect. The best $$$ I've spent on shoes in quite some time, and when I wear these out, I'll get the same shoe again."
217780,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
334711,1,"Absolutely love these. For those worried about sizing, I find Clarks tend to fit a little big and therefore usually go with a half size smaller (the leather will also stretch a bit).Overall, incredibly pleased with them and have received many compliments."
376844,1,"I bought a pair of these (in navy blue) for my baby son several months ago. We live in Minnesota, and I thought they would be nice and warm (and cute) for the winter months. Soon, I realized that not only are they warm and cute, but also the best thing since sliced bread. Or, in the world of babies, the best thing since the invention of disposable diapers. If your baby's socks fall off and leave you searching for its mate, or trying to figure out clever ways to keep them on (tucking them in pants, etc), then this bootie is definitely something you'd love too. Never *ever* has a bootie fallen off, even with crawling, jumping, climbing, etc. So, his feet are toastie warm all the time. Since he is outgrowing the navy booties, I just bought the next size up in brown.Hooray for these Robeez booties! I wish they'd had these for my first two kids!"
251914,1,I read other reviews and they all raved about this flip flop. They were correct. My son is in college and wears flip flops year round so needless to say he is hard on a shoe. They look and wear well and are very comfortable according to him. I was also grateful to find his large shoe size. I would highly recommend this flip flop for anyone - casual or constant. The price was great. We have paid alot more for flip flops and they only lasted a short time.
319065,0,"Good looking shoe that was well made. It was the right size, but just didn't fit. I had to return the shoes. I have a very narrow foot that is hard to fit."
193693,0,Bought these shoes as part of my daughter's school uniform. Good-looking all-white shoes are hard to find. These fit great and were perfect until she came home with the seams splitting after about 2 months. Don't know if she is just hard on them or if they are not made as well as they used to be. Might give them another shot with a second pair.
71011,1,I find this pair of boots to be very attractive and likewise comfortable.I wear them for long hours and have No Problem! Great PROTECTION FOR My Ankle Too.!
86698,1,"The product was handled professionally by the supplier and the supplier rendered all assistance that was needed and the product was delivered on time. Good product, good job by supplier"
91629,1,"The only reason I don't give the 5 stars to this shoe is because the rubber tip sort of hurts your big toe. No matter how I laced them, tight or loosen, it was hurtful, up to point I had to stop using them."
73392,0,I bought these crocs size 2XL 12/13. I wear size 13 2E and they feel rather tight. My toes are punching out the front holes of these clogs. I had the crocs chinese imitation size 13 and they feel more comfortable than the originals.Please be warned that these crocs are smaller than the one that came before.I think I should have bought the crocs baya or clasic as they come in whole sizes rather than a range of sizes. My foot always end up at the larger end of the range.
90130,1,"I read reviews of these before buying this pair - I have bought two pairs of Timberland boots before, one pair thats literally lasted app. 20 years with a lot of use, and another pair that only lasted two years. I received these in yesterday, and will update the review if they don't break in well or last. So far my impressions are - 1. Accurate to size, 13w, I wear New Balance / Nike wide tennis shoes as additional reference 2. Comfortable, but not cushiony if you know what I mean, I wore them all day yesterday without blisters or sore spots 3. I was expecting non insulated boots, which I got, but these are still warm to hot - gussetted tongue and no ventilation means these are not a boot I am looking forward to wearing on a construction site in the middle of a Texas summer. I have received in what I expected, and given Timberlands reputation and my exp I'm giving it 5 stars pending further experience with this pair of boots."
94841,1,"Even though the heel is nearly 7"" high, they're not like wearing extreme high heels with a slanted foot (on your toes). The fit is snug but not firm, very comfortable inside. They fit large for women, comparatively, since they're sold/made for men, they are wider too."
371573,1,I am so pleased with these boots. Not only are they adorable on but they are also comfortable!! The leather is rich in color and very high quality. What a great deal!
18393,1,We had ordered it .it came fast and was exactly what we ordered. Fit well nice product happy with them.
15445,1,"I am very satisfied with the shoes, I have 2 pairs."
174613,1,"I've been wearing this model of Clark shoe for about 25 years now. I regularly wear them out. I didn't know what foot comfort was until I tried on a pair of Natureveldt's back in the 80s. I used to have heel soreness problems. With these shoes, that problem is gone. And the current pricing makes them a bargain. I have paid from $110 per pair (in the 80s) to $135 per pair (early 2000's) and they are worth every dime. I HIGHLY recommend trying these shoes."
360362,1,"Order this shoe 1/2 size LARGER than your street shoe. It is wrongly stated in product description to order 1/2 size smaller!! Also, if you have slightly wide feet, order the Wide."
38005,1,"I just purchased my third pair of Bonnie Lites and own wine, black and taupe. I have knee problems and a hard insole really hurts my knees. The Bonnie Lites are well padded and like walking on pillows. Stylish and comfortable!"
231652,1,"These are my favorite shoes in the whole world! They are as light as a feather and stay on your feet without any ""gripping"" needed! They also last a long time. Worth every penny."
269986,1,Received what I wanted and wear all the time. I like 'em.
155531,1,"LAST CHRISTMAS I ORDERED THIS BOOT AND NOW THIS YEAR THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED. I AM WISHING THAT I HAD ORDERED MORE THAN ONE PAIR. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER PAIR THIS YEAR. I LIKE THE SOLES AND HEELS ON THIS BOOT BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER THAN MOST AND THIS IS THE FINEST LOOKING DRESS BOOT MADE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IT IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT THAT I HAVE FOUND. YOU WILL GET SOME RESPECT WHEN YOU ARE SEEN IN THESE BOOTS. THESE BOOTS ARE ""BOSS"" TO SAY THE LEAST."
356738,1,"I got these to wear as part of a Halloween costume--Abby from NCIS. These are the exact boots she wears in the promo photo on the cover of (I think) the season 9 DVD. They're so comfortable--much more comfortable than I thought they'd be! I could wear them for hours, unlike normal high-heeled shoes. They're very adjustable, all the way up the leg shaft--there is a hidden lace behind the buckles. The buckles themselves are also adjustable on both sides. I'm very happy with them! (As a side note, I got a half-size lower than usual--I'm a size 9.5--and they fit great.)"
137320,1,"I really like these shoes! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper. I've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet. But the main problem with my old Asics is they're dorky looking for casual wear. These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I'm not even wearing shoes. Unlike running shoes, these are very thin and offer very little little support. Lots of shoes make my feet look big, but these make my feet look sleek. Workmanship appears good but I don't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin. Normally I wouldn't pay $70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking. If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking, I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape. Granted I don't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are. Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down..."
24597,0,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
170315,1,"I bought these for my husband because he has foot problems. He has worn them several times and finds them extremely comfortable. The sizing was perfect. They are a beautiful well made shoe, pricey, but when you can't walk what is price?I highly recommend this shoe."
95119,1,"This is a great price for a tight looking shoe. I do admit it looks a little dull on the web, but it person these shoes are awesome! The fit is great, and its great for running up and down the court.I have had these shoes for awhile now, and they still look new and feel good; probable because i got the black ones. I have been purchasing ATR's since they begin to make them, and i have alwayz been happy with my buy, so i would check out this shoe, or the ATR Elite shoe, which looks nice in white, which i bought.Overall, this is a great price, and a great looking shoe. You won't be dissapointed with this buy, no matter what color shoe you get. Thanx, and plz rate this helpful!!!"
327483,1,"These shoes offer great support, and cushion for tired, aching feet. I purchased these shoes for my bad knees and back and love the relief I get. I highly recommend them to anyone needing that little bit of extra support."
247115,1,"This product is nice with high quality sole; after the normal 2-3 day break in, very comfortable. Looks sharp. I also like the shoe strings."
205498,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
267922,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
16410,0,"I am sure they are great on real grass with the right size. One thing I noted is that they are bigger than what the guide says. I am a 10.5 regularly but they feel like a 11 or 11.5! In addition to that, I got the worse shin splints and hip pain playing on turf and sun backed grass! Unimaginable pain. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the playing surface.Conclusion: Get these one size smaller, and use them on firm natural grass fields."
69026,0,"I like these shoes a lot but are they really worth almost a $100 more than the sketchers I bought a year earlier. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra cushioning but would say cushioning insoles be just as effective and cheaper to boot? I guess it is one's individual preference. Me, I wish now I had just purchased another pair of Sketchers and bought some Dr. Scholl's insoles. Only time will tell if these outlast my last pair of boots and if so than that will be another plus."
271338,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
297034,1,excellent shoe with classic clarks design.. little trouble getting them on pulls your socks really tight on toes . im sure itll ov away after break in . i recommend a half size smaller than normal shoe size.sent back with 3.99 next day shipping thanks to my prime account .
95470,1,birkenstock sandals keep your feet cool and feel so good on your feet. get them resoled and they are already molded to your feet. don't be fooled by cheaper ones or knock offs they are not the same.
77441,1,My husband wanted a pair of crocs for an upcoming fishing trip. I purchased the XL for him as he's a size 10 1/2 - 11. They fit him perfectly and the color is just right (khaki). So far so good.....The crocs were put to use on a recent fishing trip and worked great.
262415,2,They din't send my this item after 2 months and charge to the credit card.This is a rob
35842,1,My son wanted these for basketball and it was hard finding them. Ordered them - got them in great time and he really enjoys wearing them.
98082,0,"The shoes ran a little smaller and so I had to exchange them to a half size bigger. I did not have any problems with the exchange. The shoe is a wide, but still feels a bit snug, but at least it fits better now. I am not sure I would buy this brand again. I well have to wear it for a couple of months to see how it performs."
46531,0,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
387181,1,"I bought these for my wife, and she loves them. Some reviewers have complained about the tags in heels, but they don't bother her. She says they are warm and comfortable. She normally wears a 7.5, and since these don't come in half sizes, I bought a size 7 for her. Since these are made of foam and conform to her feet, the half-size smaller was the way to go, versus a half-size larger."
114629,1,Second time ordering these shoes. I would order a complete size up. Perfect shoe for play and to wear with a nice outfit.
289794,1,I just purchased this shoe in IVORY ... and what I expected was an offwhite shoes but it was beautiful shimmery pinkish hue ... WOW is all I can say ...GORGEOUS shoe!!!
285041,1,"THE BOOTS WERE GREAT, VERY SOLID GOOD FOR WORK VERY DURABLE, WOULD I BUY THEM AGAIN? OF COURSE I WOULD YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"
176433,1,"Brought these shoes couple months ago & have been happy with them. I generally am US sz11 or AU sz10 but found these are running a little bigger so when I purchase my next pair of these will be getting US sz10.5 instead of 11. I find them very comfortable for working long shifts & they are wearing well so far, but am thinking of adding a little more arch support but they are ok without added extra's.Update: I've had these shoes for near 12 months & they are great. I want to order more but amazon dont have them only other shoe sellers do that dont do shipping to Australia.Plz Amazon get these shoes back to being able to be shipped to Australia as I need another 2 pairs.These shoes fit my insoles for Plantis nicely & am finding that these shoes are the only ones I can wear atm because of hip ligament injury"
341186,1,"I have worn Enzo Liberty Loafers for years because they are the perfect flat shoe. This pair did not disappoint. The quality is excellent. The leather is soft and supple. No break-in time needed. They are true to size. I purchased black smooth leather which is basic black. I recommend these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes in my closet. A great shoe with slacks, jeans, skirts or dresses. The ordering and shipping experience was good. I received the shoes during the time frames outlined during the ordering process."
771,1,Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.
41639,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
55180,1,Leads; still love them after all these years! Wore them as a kid and they still feel great! Yay Keds
360322,1,"This shoe is awesome. If you appreciate the kitten heel and added stability of an ankle strap, this saucey little dancing shoe is for you. Always order 1/2 size up and consider the wide version if you don't like the feel of a form fit, these babies are very slender and run small. I'm wearing these to work and out dancing with the boyfriend and they've been fab so far. love them!"
339783,1,The shoes were in excellent quality and the size and the color were correct. Very good product. I am very happy with my purchase.
279495,1,"Black All-Star High-tops ConverseHonestly these are the best shoes I have ever owned. I bought a pair for school, and I instantly knew that these were the shoes that would last me through the school year. And so far they have. My dad told me ""You should get the smaller size."" I asked why, and he said ""You ruin and ware down shoes easy."" But I have proved him so wrong. It's been 3 months and not even a single scratch. What I love about these shoes is they don't try to be special because they already are special. The makers don't add glitter or sparkles to make them stand out. If you are looking for normal this is the way to go.You should know there is only one word that can describe these shoes: ""Unique."" Here are some other words that describe them just as well: Elegant, amazing, popular, mind blowing, smooth, and just plain absolutely incredible! They are very, very comfortable shoes that could possibly go with any outfit. (Just Joking) But they do go with numerous outfits which is great. And did I mention that they are stylish.When you go buy them (most definitely) really it varies on where to go and buy them. The price is a very touchy subject, mostly because they cost different at every store. If you are looking for a bigger size, you might want to go to Footlocker or Famous Footwear. But the thing is even those are a bit more expensive than others, but they have better quality than the rest. They may be expensive but they are totally worth it.Some pros and cons of them would be:PROS-if you want comfort you want these shoes-You want style they are definitely the shoes for you-You want your feet to be a little bit airy you might want these shoes-They are light weight for faster runningCONS-On hot days your feet will sweat a ton. So if you live in Texas these are absolutely, most definitely not the shoes for you!!!-If you want airy these are not the shoes for you."
108702,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
294153,1,"I have worn them for years, they fit and ware well. I ware them as slippers and when I fly."
77983,1,I wish I had seen the 1/2 size larger recommendation. Mine are 1/2 size too small! Nice boots though.
370361,1,"Bought these for my boyfriend. He LOVES them. They are very sturdy and the leather is thick enough not to tear or anything. He uses them as hiking boots. As far as I know they are true to size and comfortable. I bought different (darker) laces for them because the ones they come with are kind of light and they look weird, but laces are cheap."
65280,0,"The shoes looked exactly as they appeared on Amazon; however, I wear a size 11 and I ordered a size 11, but the shoes are very big on me. They feel like they are a size and a half too big."
211204,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever made and they look very conservative. I have them in several colors because they look good with slacks or skirts. They hold up well with everyday use and are lightweight so they pack well. If you try one pair, you keep coming back to them for your basic wardrobe."
180498,1,"I am on my third pair of converse, and I LOVE it to bits. They're reliable (My first pair lasted 2 years, i was reluctant to buy another since it broke in), last forever (you know, 2 years is a lot considering the other cheap China made crappy shoes), and when you break them in, they're heaven to your feet. One thing though, if you are going to use it for exercising, bad idea. Some Dr.Scholl's slip-ins might make it more bearable. Overall, comfort 8/10 and style 10/10. Customizable 10/10. Great buy!"
28384,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
252538,1,I replaced a pair of wore out Crocs that were great everyday around the house shoes. Order arrived promptly and was just as I ordered.
109871,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
178308,1,"The all white shoes are cool and all, but the red and white ones are sweet. They look and play great. They don't slip on an indoor or outdooe court. These are the best looking and best playing shoes you can get for $85. You should buy two pairs; one for playing and one for just walking around."
19892,1,I love they way they fit and feel. Rockport makes a great quilty shoe.I would buy these shoes again. Thanks Rockport.
358726,1,"These shoes need no breaking in. They are comfortable fromthe get-go. It is hard these days to find a pair of truly WHITE shoes.These fit the bill perfectly and are generic-looking enoughto go with any outfit. I originally ordered a pair for tap dancing.They were so comfortable to dance in that I ordered a pair for ""street"" shoesas well. Glad I did! (Remember to order one full size bigger than your regularshoe size when ordering these shoes.)"
75048,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
181079,0,I rated this shoe a three because i thought i could wear this shoe for running but it is not a running shoe. I like the unique look of the shoe and is comfortable for casual use. The price wasn't bad when I bought it from amazon. The delivery came very fast as well.
317497,1,"I discovered this shoe while recovering from a foot injury and bought it for the ease of entry/exit and philosophy of the manufacturer. I have since bought a second pair and when not at work, wear nothing else winter or summer. Only draw back is the wear of the sole but have found a convient cobler who replaces the heel every other year. Definately a shoe worth every penny."
42388,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
73519,1,"I recently bought a pair of these truly amazing shoes, it is impressive looking and has a snug fit ensuring complete support. I am an athlete and this shoe is one of the best running shoes I have ever come across. I love these shoes and would really recommend them to anybody active."
212025,1,"The perfect fit. It reminded of the pair that I had owned 12 years ago. As soon as I received them, I put them on with a pair of short jeans accompanied by a pair of white footies and they looked great on my feet."
242830,1,"I found these shoes to be very comfortable......and fun. For someone just learning to tap, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that may not fit well. These were perfect."
384408,1,These are wonderfully comfortable shoes todo just about anything casual in. I will gladdly get another pair when I need soft shoes again.
74625,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
218657,1,These shoes are great they look nice too! The only thing is that they don't have great arch support so I suggest getting some Dr Scholls Insoles.
338319,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylor's since the varsity issued them in High School. I wear a half size (can't get them @ the mall). Amazon had my size & color selection (this is the third pair I've bought-I'm still playing). Everything else (convenience, getting the order right, getting them delivered quickly, etc.) was excellent. I'll buy @ Amazon again."
83858,1,"my girlfrind love this sandals , they are very good looking , confortable and easy to clean"
373988,1,"I have an old pair of Jungle Mocs that I wore for 5 years. I put a lot of miles on them. They stood the test of time until I messed them up in a snow storm. The leather held up but some of the stitching stared coming out. I bought the new pair on amazon and they fit like a glove. So comfortable. The leather is almost like suede. Merrell has also put a new tread on the Jungle Moc. Makes me feel more stable, like I've got a hold on the ground. Good, comfortable, slip-on shoes."
78853,1,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
336417,1,"The only reason I don't give the 5 stars to this shoe is because the rubber tip sort of hurts your big toe. No matter how I laced them, tight or loosen, it was hurtful, up to point I had to stop using them."
64297,1,"I love the sneakers. They are better quality than the ones at Payless, and a good price too."
296957,0,Got this $20 for my boyfriend. He was disappointed that the picture isn't exactly as shown. The bottom and sides of the rubber portion of the shoe was orange color and not white as shown in the picture. If you don't mind the shoe having orange around it then its for you. Its not well padded like name brand shoes ie puma or k-swiss but you get what you pay for which is $20 on sale. The unlisted orange tag on the bottom of the inside of the shoe doesn't rub off on his white socks. The shoe feels like its made out of some faux leather rather then genuine leather...maybe because its cheap leather material.
152840,0,"I love UGG boots...this pair is my second. However, I am not happy with EastBay, the shipper. They shipped me the wrong product and then took three and a half weeks to send me the right product. I had to continuously email them about the status of the shipment...very annoying. I love the boots though...so soft and comfortable."
217893,1,Having a wide foot they fit a little on the narrow side - I kept them knowing that canvas will probably stretch without to much problem. Also my shoes make a slight hollow sound from one of the baby toe tips; I'm assuming with time that too will abate.
351416,1,"Years ago I realized the value of spending money for quality footwear. That said, shelling out over $300 on a pair of boots was not an easy choice! My last few pairs of boots (including 2 pairs of Magnums) failed me within 6 months, so I wanted something that was going to last a long time. I did a lot of reading and looking around online and kept coming back to the Danner Fort Lewis. Everyone who owned a pair raved about them, so I sucked it up and took the plunge. Great decision!I have bizarre feet. At 6'4"" tall, one would expect a size 12 or greater, but I wear an 8.5-9 EE. In addition to high arches, I have hammer toes, so I need room in places most shoes don't allow; hence I wear boots most of the time. When I got these in and put them on, I was a little nervous. They seemed to fit well, but there was some rubbing on my outside toes. 2 days of break in later and I was good to go. I've now worn them for 2.5 years in a variety of conditions, including motorcycling through massive down pours and on hikes through mud and muck with no problems at all. In fact, each time I polish them (which isn't often enough), they could almost pass for new! I've been surprised at how well the waterproofing has held up, as this is often one of the first things to go. I have never treated them and they still keep my feet dry, even when I stomp through puddles just to see my wife's look of exasperation.Since buying these, I've been in the Danner Outlet in Portland a few times and learned that these are still US made boots, which is cool. They tell me they remain on of their best sellers, especially with LEOs, and the only time they sell a second pair is when someone wants a dress pair. I can believe it, they really are remarkable. As with all boots, trying them on first is a good idea, but for wear and durability, you can't do better than these!"
344326,1,"For all of those people who would rather pet the animals than wear them, these are the shoes for you! Converse has been making ""Chuck Taylor's"" longer than I have been alive and not one animal has lost it's life to make them! The only downside to Converse is that they are not the most comfy shoe, however, a insole insert fits rather nicely into them and then your good to go."
341854,0,"I have hand/foot syndrome from chemo, which means that my feet get very sensitive, hot and irritated. I need very comfortable shoes. These are average. To me, they are not as comfortable as everyone claims, but it could just be because I don't have average feet. I normally wear a 9.5M. I bought a 10M and they just fit and are quite snug. If I were wearing thick socks, they would be uncomfortable. They do look nice and I have gotten compliments on them. I will keep them for Summer wear when I'm wearing thinner socks than normal. I guess if you're looking for super comfort, you are going to have to cough up the big bucks for the pricier shoes."
380515,1,"These shoes are very nice. They fit fairly closely to the actual street shoes size. (Amazon states it runs about half a size smaller.) The only thing I am not thrilled with is that the upper is not real leather, but I couldn't find anything else in white that was all leather. :) I highly recommend them! They are comfortable and are well made."
77098,1,"Very comfortable shoe, quiet walking, good for standing, nice for work (which is what I bought my second pair for). Looks good and super comfortable - and this in the context that I usually don't go far without orthotics in every shoe that will take them and am not wearing orthotics in these shoes."
242986,1,"I bought a pair in the summer of 2001 for a trip and have been wearing them, usually with nicer slacks, ever since then. Have wanted to replace them and finally decided to do so. The 2001 pair still looks great, but isn't quite as comfortable as the new pair."
105580,1,"I'm on my feet all day as a Surgical Tech. This shoe is the absolute best for me. They provide great support, as well as protection, and hold up well. I've been wearing mine for a year now and even though they're still comfortable, they're beginning to look bad due to the abuse they've taken. I'm purchasing the same shoes as a replacment."
165245,1,these ugg boots are extremely warm and comfy I don't think my daughters taken them off since she received them I highly recomend them and want a pair of my own.
294301,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
291152,1,I bought these for my sister-in-law for Christmas. They look super cute and comfortable. I bought them because my mom had a pair like that years ago And loved them.
325431,1,This is a great pair of shoes and also fun to wear with a lot of compliments.
260613,1,Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
117371,1,"I work at an airport and am standing up to 8 hours or more per day. Bought the Professional 3 years ago and they are still in great shape. Looking for new pair as with all shoes the heal does wear down, but it took 3 years to wear. Would have many pairs in all the colors for my personal wardrobe if not for the price. Only other downfall is that I am not comfortable in any other shoes, even my athletic shoes.Dansko Professional"
375442,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
167322,1,I have bought several pairs of these shoes(other vendors) & love them. I found these on Amazon at a great price. I would wear these all the time if I could.
108639,1,"I bought these sandals for my mom because they looked nice and were from Softspots a company I love. She hasn't worn them out yet but reportrd them to be very comfortable. Just what we were looking for. Excellent product as usual. I highly recommend,"
338302,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
141078,1,"I really love these, I finally have a pair again. They haven't changed at all and that's good, I like that they haven't messed with it. Although they do have more conventional styles of shoes for those who won't go the way of tradition. I had a pair of these when I was a teenager. I used to wear them with shorts, skirts, jeans. They make this wonderful wooden clopping sound when walking, which is fun in itself. Your toes will grip the front to keep them from sliding off. Which brings up a point...if they slip off while you're walking or in a fast stride it's gonna hurt like nobody's business. I've had that happen a few times in my day and it is very painful. But I survived. Ya live and learn. Enjoy!"
232777,1,"great looking shoe with a comfortable fit. Versatile since it can be worn with shorts, jeans or a casual skirt. Love them!"
39629,1,Nice little arch support -- firm enough to do some good & last a while. The thong is just a little short for me -- hoping wearing them little by little will stretch the thong & squish down the sole just enough to be perfect.
294823,1,The item was exactly as described and good quality. They matched the socks given to my daughter by the soccer league. Very fast shipping.
246304,2,I also bought a pair of boots for my daughter. They run very small - at least 1 to 1 1/2 sizes too small. I had to return at my expense.
189734,1,"I already own a pair of these shooes and like them, so I bought an extra pair and I'm really happy and they arrived fast;)."
334669,1,muy buen producto llego en el tiempo esperado y con las condiciones de la publicaci&oacute;n lo recomiendo al 100 %
234211,1,"I recently ordered my third pair of these K-Swiss and right away noticed a change in comfort over the previous two pairs that I still have to directly compare with. I also noticed the new pair are now made in Indonesia where as my previous two pairs where made in Thailand.There is a VERY noticeable decrease in the padding around the ankle sides, so much so that the new pair fit looser around the ankle area than both of the old pairs. I really do not like how lose they fit now nor the feeling of my foot coming out the back of the shoe.Bottom padding does feel like a new shoe should but overall they just do not have that amazingly comfortable new shoe feeling like my second pair had when they replaced my first pair. I remember how amazing the second pair felt when they were new compared to the ones they where replacing. This time I had to put the old one on one foot and the new one on the the other to feel a difference.I am on my feet in my restaurant for 12-13 hours a day and I wore my first pair for about 6 months and my second pair about 4 months. These I may use only as long as it takes to find a pair that are made in Thailand or another brand all together.Even with the decrease in comfort they are a decent value. In my opinion though they went from a good deal for comfortable shoes at $60 to just an average $60 pair of shoes. I would rather go back to spending $80-$100 for a comfortable pair of shoes that last the same amount of time."
2530,1,"I am very hard on soles and have finally worn these out after two years of hard use. These shoes do it all- look nice, keeps water out, and is the most comfortable I have ever worn. I am looking to get the exact same pair- but hard to find on sale anywhere but since the are so nice, they are worth the price."
68172,0,"I have purchased Sketchers in this style the last few years, perfect look for work and casual wear. They are comfortable to wear even during long periods of walking. To this point I have not had any issues with Sketchers, this particular shoe however the sole has split in the right shoe after 3 months. I would like to make sure that you are aware that I do walk approximately 3 to 4 miles per day in these shoes and they are perhaps just not built for that type of wear. Other than that which was most likely less due to a design flaw than it was an issue with it being used outside of it's purpose, it's a great shoe and I will be purchasing another pair."
310004,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
157650,1,"The shoe fit me well, and it came in the original condition - no damages, and it came on time."
184641,1,"I bought this boot for my son who is 8yrs old. it is made of the usual high quality material, looks like it will last a lifetime. I will recommend this product to anyone who has a kid that is very active. Also it arrived quickly!"
257458,1,Great support and Super Comfort. Great relief for back pain due to the support and contour of the heel. Highly Recommend these shoes. I have multiple Clark shoes and find them extremely comfortable and sturdy. Professional looking as well for business.
231708,1,Teva has the best shoes for those of us who have bunions and/or high arches. The shoes form to your foot shape and provide adequate padding. If only they could come up with a flip flop type shoe that also is somewhat enclosed so that they can be worn at work.
19243,0,"I ordered this shoe directly from the Easy Spirit site. I ordered a medium width, and that is the marking the shoe is showing, but it is much too narrow for my foot, making it very uncomfortable. I made the mistake of not returning them, thinking that I could wear them and stretch them out: That didn't work. Guess I'll spend the money to take them to a shoe-shop to have them professionally stretched."
305424,1,This shoe is a jewel and fits like it was made for my foot. It is a quality shoe and I feel like I got it at a steal! I will be on the lookout for more of this brand
37163,1,Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds. She loves them.
254891,1,the boots came in faster than the date scheduled which was awesome and they fit better than i expected! Everything came in the box and the shoes looked exactly like in the picture.
218819,1,My only probelm with these shoes are that they are not comfortable at all. do buy some type of inserts..
149708,1,These shoes are my fav! reebok classics are the most amazing shoes eva just took awhile to get here thats all.
269659,1,"These are the most comfortable walking shoes going. I have had many pairs over the years and love every one. However, occasionally some sales clerk will convince me that they have something better. I buy...I'm sorry and then I get another pair of Prowalkers. They are light and you can wear them forever without that tight heavy feeling that so many ""walking"" shoes get."
265254,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
65050,0,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
130756,1,MY DAUGHTER LOVED THESE. PRETTY HARD TO FIND SHOES FOR TEENAGERS PICKY TASTE SOMETIMES BUT SHE FLIPPED OVER THESE. THANK-YOU
121997,1,"Just returned from a tour of Europe. Our tour guide wore these shoes almost every day as she walked with us for miles and miles. For years I have worn Birkenstock or Mephisto sandals, but the design of these shoes caught me eye. They truly are 'out of the box' comfy. My regular shoe size is 7, but I find that the Euro size of 36 to fit most comfortably in the Birkenstocks and Mephisto. 36 feels just right in the Think brand."
116227,0,I thought these shoes would be perfect for a wedding...I think I expected them to be just little flats and not like a slipper. A little dissapointed.
93604,0,"not bad, looks a little plain though."
275597,1,I am just breaking these shoes in; but to this point in time they are very comfortable. They appear to be made quite well and for the price they are a good value.
167727,0,"Usually my feet stray off of flip-flops toward the inside, but the pretty and plentiful straps on these Tevas keep my feet in the correct place. They're also extremely comfortable - nice and squishy. Unfortunately, they also turn the bottoms of my feet BLACK and the discoloration doesn't come off easily - it takes some scrubbing with soap and a washcloth. These flip-flops would get 5 stars if it weren't for that."
104504,1,this item i had ordered was for my teenage son it was one of the few places i was able to find this on line he was happy i was happy the order was quickly filled 5 stars thank you amazonsincerly bethConverse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Black Canvas
219109,0,The size is way off on these shoes. I did end up returning them but they were very helpful with the whole process
267940,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
91446,2,"Nice looking shoes, but the ones I received are way too small. They say size 7.5N, but definitely are not. I will have to return them."
89644,1,"I got the ""pumice"" color which is a pretty light gray with blue details, not stiped like the black sandal shown. Protection for the big toe, comfortable to wear immediately. Machine washable. I am very happy with these sandals."
361842,0,I bought these shoes for myself. They look nice but there is no arch support and they just don't fit all that well. They are sitting in my closet and will probably end up at the local Goodwill.
18529,0,"These flip-flops are super in quality but i was disappointed with the size i order. I received a pair of these Havaianas Brasil flip-flops in pink as a gift and the size 39/40 fitted perfectly but when i ordered the size 39/40 online it was a bit small, i needed the next size up, don't understand why the same sandal in the same size has 2 different fit, 1 just right and 1 a bit small.If you intend to order these order a size up from your regular size."
244185,1,My God baby looks like a little man in these. When I saw these I knew I had to get these for him. He looks so suave in them and the are true to form as seen in on the screen.
355934,2,Box toes - people do not have boxed toes....Other vendors will accept returns - but Amazon will not....due to an arbitary date of return .......
54725,1,"The shoes were great, but I have such a small feet they were too big. Sorry I had to return them."
40150,1,I love reefs and these do not dissapoint. Very comfy and will match all the earth tones in my summer wardrobe! Note: I normally wear a 9.5 and ordered up to a 10 b/c they dont have 1/2 sizes and it was perfect a 9 wouldve been too small so order UP!
246880,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
178587,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
185371,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
202926,1,"These sandals have been comfortable to wear for the most part, but due to the lack of odor control they become smelly and burn from extended wear. I have had to add foot powder before each use to be able to wear for more then a couple of hours. Keen should either remove the odor control as an attribute or improve its function."
41732,1,"I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years. I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street. They are VERY COMFORTABLE, ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe.They felt like a favorite, comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on...SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction,logging or concrete work. Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT, I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread, giving you fair traction in the grass, snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also...the boot's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor, while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact. Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection. I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof, you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment. KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather, material, sewn seams splitting or tearing, and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off, however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So, I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots...Order a bit thicker,round nylon boot laces, instead of the flat, cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However, trust me, your wife will remind you,often, to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought,have been just as happy with, are the White's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $500.00The FARM BOOTS are a great deal! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care /pride in the product,a good design philosophy, used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country, when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
230763,1,These Tim's are very comfortable & can be worn with just about any outfit. They are attractive to the eye & the best construction boots on the market. I highly recommend them.
99566,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
330676,1,"The Angioline Liberty Flats are available in numerous colors for a reason. The comfort, fit, quality, and appearance can't be beaten. No matter what you wear, there's a color of shoes to match, and they always look nice. I have many people ask me where I buy my shoes, and I'm more than happy to tell them. I recommend The Shoe Mall, and Angioline shoes to anyone who'll listen."
74375,1,"I buy these every year for my preschooler. They are great summer shoes, perfect for water play and the backyard. My daughter is able to put them on and off by herself. I like them better then water shoes they slip on easier and they are easy to clean."
288056,1,"What can I say? This is my fourth or fortieth pair of birkies - and no matter how much money I spend on other expensive name brands or how many different sandals I really try to love, I'll always come back to my first love, my birks. I feel the most comfortable in them, and I'll probably wear them into my serious old age. One tip - I bought a pair and ""saved"" them for my cruise to Acapulco - MISTAKE!! The sole pretty much melted from the heat of the asphalt and their life was shortened dramatically. Wear your old ones or something else when you are in the real heat."
176680,1,"I bought this shoe last year in navy suede, and loved it. This year I wanted another pair in beige suede, but finally found it in beige smooth leather. Love them both as they cover my bunions without pressure, and have a small heel. The bumpy padding feels so good, and gives great support. It must have been discontinued, but if they bring it back next year, I'll buy red."
145565,1,The boots are high quality but my daughter told us to buy one size smaller because they stretch. Wore them all day and all they did was hurt my feet. Wish I could return but I already wore them.
197030,0,"My husband, wearing a size 9, could not get his foot inside this slipper. Will probably have to return and try a larger size."
316687,1,THANKS FOR GETTING 2 ME SO FAST......HE LOVES IT....THANKS AGAIN HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR FOR ALL U DID FOR ME....
30224,1,I love these shoes! They are comfortable and stylish. I have gotten nothing but great complements from them. Well worth the money!
260247,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
125873,1,"Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. I bought my first pair last summer, as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that. They are thin and have breathable mesh, I very much recommend you go out and buy them."
336192,1,"Shoes are comfortable, but the L.L.Beans shoes are more comfortable. Also found them cheaper than on-line. So was a bit disappointed. Bythe time I paid shipping I could of saved $18.00.These also are not the latest style.Thanks Sofia"
84420,1,"This is the 3rd time Amazon has requested a review and as I said before in my first review, the product arrived in a timely fasion and I'm completely satisfied. AMAZON needs to stop sending me review requests!"
63083,1,"These shoes are cute and convenient. I pair them with jeans to do chores like grocery shopping, or when I go to the movies. They don't really have arch support so I won't be wearing them for long walks.They do fit a little differently and are narrow, but it works for my feet. I would not recommend these shoes to people with wide feet or who plan to use them all day, everyday."
311128,1,"These are the best shoes! I walked for miles without difficulty, pressure points, or blisters. They are so comfortable I barely knew they were on my feet. I highly recommend them."
152558,1,"This is the second pair of Merrell Jungle Moc I own. The first one bought in 2006 is still in use but after all these miles in town and nature the sole is becoming thin now and I absolutely wanted the same shoes again. Slipping in is so easy and they fit perfectly, even when it is hot or when I do long walks over several hours. They are tough and cleaning them is so easy. I never want to miss them"
134498,1,"I would have given 5 but I have been buyer these for a long time and I feel the quality is falling just a bit. If a manufacturer in the US would make something as comfortable and as nice looking, I love this style I would buy them as I really hate the fact they are made in China."
281595,0,Good-looking shoes but not to trek in. What you see on the outside is the only layer - you step into a thin layer of suede that will not stand up to elements. The bottom is rubbery and sort of gluey and the inside is thin.
248318,1,"These are the best boots I have ever purchased. Unbelievably the most comfortable boot I have ever purchased, even brand new. I won't be buying another Redwing boot again. These put them to a shame. Haven't had soar feet from break in at all. With redwing I can barely walk after the first week of wearing them. Quality seems the same as any brand out there. Best part of all, MADE IN THE USA!!!!!!"
97150,1,"Arrived on time to my home address while I was away at school. The shoes had no imperfections, and I get compliments on them now and then. I will likely do business with this same seller again for another pair/next sneaker purchase."
196696,1,"This is a nice little bag. The leather is soft, and the hardware is nice looking. It is good quality for the price."
96587,1,I bought 2 of these and have worn them almost everyday to work for over a 2 years. I am getting ready to purchase 2 more pair. I love them.
219269,1,"We just received these shoes for our almost 4 year old. He LOVES them. The soles are nice and the single velcro strip is quick and easy. Difficult to tell from the photo, but McQueen has a little toothy grin at the toe. He is convinced he is now fast as lightning! It was nice to find a Cars shoe in a color other than black."
186590,1,Purchased for a nursing home resident who had totally worn out an exact pair. Perfect! The resident was delighted! Thank you.
81787,1,"I bought this shoe in the giraffe print...it fits great, looks great, no complaints. Fast shipping, great price. Highly Recommend!!!"
101937,1,"These shoes were exactly what I was looking for! Well made. They were a little tight, but because of the material they stretched nicely."
114271,1,I purchased these as required by my 5 yr old's ballet teacher. They were durable and did their duty as ballet shoes. They were easily able to be tightened to make them thinner for my daughter's foot. Easy on and off. I can't complain :)
47854,1,I bought the shoes for my son. He likes it very much. Your Amazon services are excellent.
285252,1,"I have had these slippers for over a year. They wear very well, are warm and comfortable. Good construction and well made. They hold their shape and don't get stretched out or sloppy. Great quality at a good price. The sole is tough enough for outdoor wear around the yard."
234267,0,"bought it from amazon, last week. the shoe sole is made up of rubber, old fashoioned, thought it would be synthetic, like adidas & rbk. however, got good looks when worn, and quite comfortable."
300802,1,"Looking for a luxury loafer that stands out? If you are in the lower latitudes this is a great choice. Excellent quality. Light weight. Wear in the office or for special client meetings. Not intended for extensive walking, e.g. 85 Broad St. to the subway. Not intended for rain or dirt. Fit for 8M is exactly as it should be not like the Tommy Bahamas that run half a size large."
316551,1,"Nice shoes, but lack up support might not make them last after while, but nice design and concept. I get alot of compliments.BUT I would not order form footlocker again. They shipped these in a bag!? A shoe box in a bag?! By the time they got to me the box was totally crushed and not in any good condtion. BAD BAD SHIPPING I called footlocker and they could have cared less."
317380,1,"This shoe looks awesome and once its broke in feels great. I got a blister breaking them in, first time ever in a New Blance shoe."
158776,1,"These sneakers are from back in the day, but people still wear them! You can wear them with no laces and the tongue sticking out.....like Run DMC, or you can just wear them any way. They go with almost everything and they're definitely comfortable!"
84222,1,I wasn't really feeling the other colors that came out before the gray and reds. These are so hott and definitely a MUST HAVE. Don't forget to throw on some jeans and a gray &amp; red rocawear shirt and you're good to go. ROC
29986,1,"I have been a huge fan of the 760 series, starting with the 762, and all the way up. These are the best yet. Perfect support, and extreme comfort. They work with you to get great workouts. Buy them while they still have your size!"
189179,1,I love the shoe but I did not get the shoe I ordered. The company had discontinued the shoe and did not have my size. They tried to replace them with another shoe but sent me a men's shoe and I had to return them. I finally got a replacement shoe but it was not a mid but regular shoe. I needed them so I am wearing them. The Amazon customer service was really bad the only help I got from them was an offer for $5.00 off my next order. Why would I use Amazon again? I told her to keep the $5.00.
197192,1,I ordered these shoes in black. They are beautiful. However you should order half a size bigger than you normally wear.
257390,1,"Look sharp at the gym. Kind of squeeky when wet. I throw them in the washing machine to clean them. I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift ...j.g. Staten Island, NY"
318501,1,"The only shoes I am able to wear all day. I have bad feet and need orthotics. Lower cut shoes don't allow me to use them. Sorry to see the price keeps going up each year. Also, harder to find each year. Couldn't even find them at Reeboks in my size (average). Have been wearing them for over 20 years."
72300,1,"The shipping was prompt, the shoes are GREAT and I have another order ready to send! Thanks for your commitment to customer satisfaction!!"
20617,1,"I absolutely love these sandals. The delivery time was super fast (about 3 days sooner than expected) and they were in perfect shape. I've been wearing them near constantly and they seem to be holding up really well and are much more comfortable than any other pair I have ever used. Reef uses two types of foam in their sandals, a firmer foam for the sole and a softer foam that eventually molds to your feet. The firmer foam also provides some arch support, it's not great but it's a lot better than what you usually get with flip-flops. On some sandals I've owned, the stalk (idk what it's actually called, it's the part between your toes) causes discomfort but on these the fabric they used is really comfortable and took no time at all to get used to.I highly recommend these sandals, they're awesome!"
86562,1,"I'm so glad that I discovered these shoes! I have them in every color and wear them most of the time. I travel a lot and I can walk all day in these shoes without pain. I especially like the idea of the velcro straps everywhere so that if your feet swell from sitting too long, you can let them loose a little while. They don't take up lots of room in your luggage. You can be dressed up or dressed down. I've worn them to the beach and also for evening wear with a long skirt. Treat yourself and buy a pair of these wonderful shoes! Order your regular size as they are true to fit. Ignore the person who compared these to Clark's. These are better."
106284,0,great look...but not too comfortable. overall i am pleased with them and have received many compliments. i just wish they offered a more cushiony fit.
189310,1,"He has been wearing these boots every day for over 2 years now...whether he's landscaping, logging, snow shoveling. plumbing or working on a vehicle., it's a guarantee it will be done in his Carolina's...just yesterday he started rambling on again about how much he really loves them. Every once in awhile he gets out that flat gold can of black wax and replaces the laces and then holds 'em up to the light with pride,&#34; Look Hun, just like new again!&#34; In fact, while I am right here on this link, right now....I think I will secretly order him another pair to keep aside for him, as a back-up..... ;)"
299248,1,"I had no problems whatsoever with this order. For a supersaver delivery, it was here within a couple days! Love the shoes, very happy with the company."
282421,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
53336,0,"I have always loved Keds sneakers, however, 2 weeks after purchasing these shoes, the bottoms came loose and I had to throw them away."
260038,1,"This is the only shoe that I could find with a sole that doesn't cake up with mud (to be released bit-by-bit around the house). They are not as comfortable as some that I've had, but they are very well made."
122203,1,These are the best boots I have ever owned. They are very comfortable and I love the zipper sides.
207919,1,"This is my third pair of these shoes purchased over the past 4 years. I now have azure, natural, and black and wear them all summer long. It's very hard to find summer casual shoes that come in narrow widths, and these are very comfortable as well as versatile. You can wear them with shorts or casual skirts. When I can find them, I wear a 9.5AAAA in dress shoes. A 9AA in the Trinidads fits great."
23312,0,"I bought these online through Amazon.com for a friend because it has the built-in bottle opener on the sole of the sandal and he absolutely loves them, they are comfortable, durable and very useful. I recommend these sandals to anyone."
249233,1,"Great comfort. Great for all day wear in HOT weather, your feet stay so airy. They beat out Tevas's for comfort by far."
68768,1,"Im a Flight Nurse, so I work in EMS. These boots were extremely comfortable from day one. They are my favorite boots Ive owned so far. Ive had Bates, Rockies, Oakleys....these are the best. I think I would order 1/2 size smaller next time, there are a tad bit large, but my foot doesnt slip. Also, I meant to order side zippers, but these boots slip on and off very quickly so Im not slowed down in the middle of the night."
84927,1,"Sandals were everything I expected. I found good advice from former owners about moving UP a half size, which I recomend."
68689,1,I've had the Scrusher bolted to my back porch for years. The brushes slowly deteriorated to the point where only the frame remained. Floors & rugs suffered for it. Should have got these brushes long ago. Doesn't clean toe or heel but gets off the worst of the crud.
378981,1,I love this shoe. It is very comfortable all around and great for running. I will probably buy another pair if the price is stays the same at $74 and no tax.
3976,1,"I agree with all of the positive comments about this boot. I've had a pair of Hi-Tec Altitude ""originals"" (before they started putting numbers in the name) that just wouldn't die... until recently. I now have a brand new pair of Altitude IVs, and they're as good and almost as comfortable right out of the box as the old ones were after several years of hard use. This is a quality, comfortable boot. I'll keep buying Altitudes as long as they keep making them -- regardless of what number they put in the name.While I purchase quite a bit every year on Amazon because they've always provided me with excellent service and good prices, I found my new pair of Altitude IVs at HikingBoots.com. They were a little cheaper (including free shipping) and the customer service was every bit as good as Amazon. I'm not an employee -- just a very satisfied first-time customer."
303084,1,"Traditional style and ""feel"" (I wear these at home as slippers). Order up at least 1 1/2 sizes. You can adjust the fit using the elastic cord sewn in along the top. Detached straps to sew across the top if you'd like."
312818,1,I bought these because I have arthritic hip joints and thought they would be helpful when I have to do lots of walking. They work very well! I've even worn them to Wal-Mart to do lots of shopping. I plan to keep several pairs on hand from now on.
296391,1,"I started wearing these shoes when I was 19. Five years later, I've gone through two pairs (about to buy my third), but they've been my one and only pair of shoes. I just haven't had the desire to wear anything else. I've worn them for nearly 12 hours a day, every single day, year-round, working at a job during the day that requires constant movement, and then walking around the city at night. You can't really tell by looking at them that they've been literally everywhere with me. They could use a bit of a polish, but other than that, nothing's worn down. I suppose if I wore more shoes, I would only need one pair of these, and they'd last longer. But thats not stopping me."
319550,1,I just purchased a pair of these shoes to replace some exactly like them that I have worn every day since 1994!! Those have reached the point where the heels are so run down that they make me walk a bit crooked and one sole is nearly worn through. But can you believe that kind of service from a pair of shoes? They are so comfortable from the first day of wearing and like a well known bunny the just keep going and going. I can't reccommend highly enough.
122645,1,love this shoe. it's in wde width. don't have to travel to numerous stores that invariable don't have the wide width.
53830,1,"I have had these shoes for probably 5 years. They are still fully functional. I have owned Vans for that length of time and they have worn out in the first 2 years but Keds are extremely good quality. I have bought different colors but they never fail me. They are comfy for walking. Although, I have found out if you are walking long distances that they might strain your feet By long distance I mean a couple of miles. But overall, I love them and they are definitely worth the price."
349706,1,"I've had these boots for about a year now, and they have worn very well. I wear them all the time and the quality is great...and you can't beat the price. I have a wide foot (EE width) and the opening or upper of the boot was very narrow. I also have a pair of Red Wing boots in the same size and they are much more loose at the top. They do stretch but it take some time."
132552,1,Real ballet shoes at a reasonable price. We bought them for Christmas for our 3 budding prima ballerina granddaughters. They were ecstatic. They danced the day away. It made for a very Merry Christmas.
289686,1,"Women you know that when a husband finds something he likes, it's almost impossible to change his mind. Mine loved his slippers and wore them to shreds. then I couldn't find them and he hated every other option I offered. Finally found them and bought 3 pairs so I'd have spares for later. Great product--made my home much happier."
280721,2,The shoes arrived quickly. Unfortunately the shoes must have been seconds. Not only are they not narrow on the right shoe the one strap was sewn on incorrectly.
307133,1,I have been wearing them for about 3-4 years now and I love them and will continue to buy them.
389135,1,"I have these shoes in brown. I have been complimented several times on these shoes, and they match everything. I don't dress for comfort, but these are pretty comfortable. The only problem is that they look old quickly."
269901,1,"Great shoes, after a short break in these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Will buy again."
8235,1,"Great Product, Supper nice company, who do what they say there going to do! An Ace plus Seller ++++++High encourage all to view and purchase there fine line of products. My wife love them so well I ordered another pair for christmas."
367164,1,I like it a lot. I think it should have a way to block the vents that you're not using if you only have one pair of boots or gloves to dry. But otherwise I really like it. Works great.
24040,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
98307,0,"They are lightweight and soft leather with a flexible sole. However, there was something about the way they fit my feet that didn't work for me. There is nothing unusual about my feet (no surgery or conditions). I tried normal width first and they were too narrow. Although I don't normally order ""wide,"" I tried it. Still not right. Also, I thought the length ran large, and nobody mentioned that. I normally wear a 6.5, but needed a 6. I returned them all and am trying a new style. The price would've been right if they were a perfect fit, otherwise not worth it."
56698,1,Bought these for my daughter to play Tracy in a high school production of Hairspray set in the 60's. Great classic style and fit and perfect for a lot of dancing!
315105,1,Love these boots i can wear them all day. I live in Alaska and it can get cold and wet so far these boots are doing great! very cute they even make my feet look small! :) I ordered them before i found out i was pregnant and i was worried that when my feet swell if i would be able to wear them still and YES! I love how you can adjust the width just by the laces. in fact these are the only shoes (other than flip flops but those aren't very good for winter walking :)) that my very pregnant swollen feet can fit into and i can wear them for hours! the only problem i have with them is the velcro strap at the top that is supposed to keep it closed is bothersome it would be nice if the zipper went all the way up.
16279,1,"The boots live up to their description, they are very comfortable. And I got them in the mail a few days after I ordered them."
272113,1,"The merchandise is impeccible, the service was timely and I am very satisfied. Thanks for a smooth transaction."
199107,1,The shoe is comfortable but a bit heavier than I like. Nice looking kick-around shoe.
41153,1,"I find this shoe to be perfect for walking. I clock an average 7 miles a day on uneven ground. The sole is very comfortable, and the heel support is perfect to alleviate side to side movement. This is my 3rd pair of this shoe. I hope they keep making them......"
96426,2,when clicking on the product at you site the image kept changing from a shoe string to velcro. The walking shoe category I went to was velcro shoes. But I received tie strings instead. Had to return at my expense t6o New balance who shipped out the correct product but the wrong size. Still have that shipment and will again have to return.
351595,1,"I really like the way the shoe feels, I would have given it a 5 if it had better arch support (My other experiences w/ Propet they all had great support). The foot bed on this sandal is flat. It does not feel like it will pinch or give blisters. I have only worn it around the house so far to see how they will be."
359077,1,I bought these for my Mom. Is actually the second pair for her. She loves them so much. She wears them everywhere! Best shoe for gardening and working outside because they clean up so easy!
193588,1,"I already own a pair of these shooes and like them, so I bought an extra pair and I'm really happy and they arrived fast;)."
73079,1,"Bought these for my wife. Just what I was looking for. Perfect fit (since there are no half sizes, buyer needs to go down to next full size). E.g., If you are an 7 1/2, you need to order the 7."
367227,1,Amazing for the money and a must-have. I wish the build quality was better but this thing works and has held up so far for a 72-day ski season - used 72 times for 2 people!
340678,1,"Why doesn't anybody state that they run full size large? Maybe it's not even worth mentioning as everybody knows that, but I've never had experience with Converse before. I bought those in size 10 (men's) for my brother (he always wears 10) and they are big even for my husband (who wears 11). Other than that they are OK, good quality."
202827,1,"Love this sandal, I work as an adventure guide treking through rivers and forest in the same adventureand I have to say this is the best shoe ever, and drys quick. Has good grip, very cumfortable and light."
169857,1,"Comfortable, stylish and comes in narrow sizes which are difficult to find in many shoe brands."
179211,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
28057,1,"I had this pair of shoes for probably 3 years before I wore them to the ground. They are incredibly comfortable and very versitile. I had to part with my first pair, but I am definitley considering buying a replacement pair!"
17852,1,"I love them!! They are extremely light, and the most comfortable pair of shoes I own, PERIOD even over my tennis shoes! I wear them 5 days a week to work, and usually wear them on the weekends too because of their comfort. The Zippered feature makes getting in and out of them extremely easy! I have owned two pairs, wearing them pretty much daily a pair lasts about two years. Then I wear the soles off of them! They are definitely non-slip and have great all terrain traction. I have been in all sorts of situations with them: muddy hills (they bite into the ground like a beast! I don't slide), Oily parking lots in the rain (in normal shoes the oil makes me slide all over the place)."
7878,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
267991,1,"This is about the 4th pair of these I've bought. They are nice and confortable, and look good. Only problem is they make my feet sweat a bit. Still a good value IMO."
329355,1,I love these sandals. The soft mushy insole is really comfortable.I will wear these & my regular Teva sandals all summer.
340799,1,"These are so cute!! And comfortable, too, especially given the heel height. I love the pewter color - goes with everything, and a nice change from black, black, black."
199556,1,"I purchased these shoes as a gift for my aunt in PA. She said it is the most comfortable shoe she has ever worn. I will purchase another pair for her closer to spring but told her the red ones are year-round too. Next, I will purchase a pair for me. Many thanks. NJ"
337425,1,"once again amazon brings great deals on stride rite shoes, I always come back for more.what a deal...."
13980,2,"I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small. I ordered him an 11, which he usually wears in a slipper, to allow room for heavy socks for winter, and they were so tight across the instep that he couldn't stand to have them on. I sent them back. These are too expensive to not fit right."
84019,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
51175,1,"This sandal fits perfectly. The size runs a little small/true to size, which is just right for me since I am a size 5."
2661,1,"I read the other reviews on this site, decided the purchase these boats. I love the fact that they are lightweight, yet very supportive. I have not been able to test them to see if they are waterproof. Others on this site said they are not. They came with a tag on the right boot that says they are waterproof. I sprayed them with a water repellent just in case."
332336,1,We bought these boots for our son and he was extremely happy with the fit and feel. Good price too.
186331,0,"I ordered the product in my normal shoe size. Unfortunately it was painfully short - at least a full size too short for a narrow foot.So I think 'No problem - Amazon has a great return policy'.I fill out the return form online, print the RMA & send 'em back.But Amazon does not include mis-sizing as a 'reason for return' on the RMA. Since the decision to return the shoes was just my own choice then Amazon does not reimburse for return shipping.I guess it really doesn't matter though. Two weeks have gone by since I returned them and there has been no sign of a refund anyway.My last three orders have been jacked one one way or the other (only one of three pieces delivered on one order - 35 days to get the complete product and the other product listed in stock - two weeks and it hasn't been shipped. the part that burns is that Amazon just has this lackadasical attitude ""... too bad - whatever"""
241994,0,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year. They were smaller than the 1.5 last year. Her true foot size is a 3. Nothing bad with the quality of the shoe but the sizing needs some work. If you need to order this shoe, size up 1 to 2 sizes."
82862,1,"This is my 3rd pair of Reef flip flops. I love the arch support in them and they wear well. They dont fall apart like other brands do. I have a pair for the pool, one for around the house, and one for out and about. They are fabulous and totally worth the price."
330014,2,Amazon advertised free shipping so I took the Bait. I will not use AMAZON again. I deal with liars all day at work. I do not need to deal with more over the computer.________Amazon's reasoning: The Item was not from their inventory. So What! I feel they should back their word up and pay the shipping costs! Can I get a Hell Yeah?
227036,1,"I have been looking for a year for lowtop converse in red for my daughter. On the rare occasion that I found a pair, it was not the size I needed.I had no trouble locating them through Amazon. They arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and my daughter is thrilled. It was exactly what she wanted."
26152,1,"Aside from the old-school good looks, comfort, support, and style of the New Balance 991s, these are the unofficial shoes for prep school students and fraternity members. Wear them with khakis, a polo shirt, and a baseball hat (preferably of a large Southern state school - UNC or UVA is ideal).They are also ideal for use with contrasting laces - thick red ones are best."
202438,0,"Good looking shoe -- I've worn it about 15 times boating -- they do a good job relative to grip on the boat -- however, the leather is showing wear at this point I didn't expect. The color is fading in some areas and not in others. They shoes appear a lot older than they are."
76554,1,"This shoe came and I was able to wear them right away with out breaking them in. I am a hairdresser, so long hours on my feet mean comfortable shoes with good support. Love the sharp looks and the quality. Would love to buy some more."
303675,1,These shoes are great! I had a pair already and wanted a spare...could not find them locally but found them on Amazon.Amazon has almost everything I want and provides great service as well!
280715,1,"Love these shoes, not too heavy but real comfortable and great support. I have bought quite a few pairs of Asics as they fit my foot well. Also like the 2120's but I got a great deal on these"
235179,2,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON (SHOEFLAKE) AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO. HOWEVER, I AM OUT $60+ DOLLARS."
172527,1,"The service was very good, the product arrived as request.The product was excellent, and was sent on the date specified, and their arrival was equally efficient."
50171,1,"These are excellent boots. I have worn them for years. Also, the seller, PapaShoe, is very nice to work with, and the people there are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend their store to buy shoes from to others."
5264,1,"I ordered the ""Chuck Taylor"" Converse All Stars in Black, just because I think they go with almost everything. The packaging was fine and I had no issues with the product. It arrived before the projected date and looked exactly like the photo. The box did include two pairs of laces, both black and white. I've been wearing Converse Chuck Taylors for years and needed to replace my pair that I've worn out. I rotate my shoes, so they had just ran their course. I really enjoy these shoes, I like the look, the style (which is very classic), and the comfort. These are the most recognized sneaker, ever. More people comment on these more than any other pair that I own. The only drawback is that they run large. Make sure when you order them, you order them to your true size. Other than that, I have had no issues. YMMV."
123930,1,These little pumps are exactly what I expected to receive. They look simple and neat. I had to stretch the right one a bit as my right foot is wider than my left. I would definitely recommend them.
18397,0,"This seems to be a very nice shoe, but they run incredibly small! My daughter is normally a 12 1/2, so I ordered 1 13 1/2 and she could not even get her foot in it. You then have to pay a $5.00 re stock fee to exchange the size!I would not have been so annoyed with this, had the description said runs small! We are awaiting the new pair. The original came pretty quickly (about 4-5 days) I sent them back a week ago."
251798,1,"I was originally hesitant to spend this much on shoes but considering I wore holes from seven years of wear on my last Sperrys, I decided to bite. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and will probably be buying the exact same pair in another seven"
68747,1,"Having a mountain farm can be murder on floors in the house. Mud, straw, chicken manure can create a nonstop cleaning agenda. I installed this on the wood crossties that create the steps up to the house and it has really decreased the amount of mud and junk coming into the house. The product is solid, installs easily with the included screws and when the scrubbers wear out (whenever that might be) you can buy replacements without trashing the entire thing."
111554,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
1128,1,"Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued."
22545,0,"These shoes are fine if you can get the right size. I've ordered several in the same size and they were actually different. Watch the Youth versus Adult as they vary in width, but not length in the same size. They are a great shoe to wear in the summer, they dry quickly and can just get washed with the hose."
306345,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
19173,1,The shoes have cushion where needed which makes it a very comfortable shoe for walking. They are also very good when you have to be standing for a lenghth of time. I would recommend this shoe for people who have to be on their feet (working/standing) for a long period of time.
16026,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
1058,1,"Received these for Christmas and tried them out for the first time today. I got 10.5 Wide, and after calling Hi-Tec realized that Amazon mislabels these as 2E shoes when all wide shoes from Hi-Tec are 3e.These shoes are great! Super waterproof, true to size, and simply a great hiking boot. Hiked 8 miles today to break them in, no blisters. Slight pain for the first few miles, but after they were great.I'll keep everyone posted as I keep using them. Very impressed so far."
303165,1,I've had many pairs of these Clark sandals because they are the most comfortable sandal I've ever owned. They give great support and are good for walking. This price was excellent.
219050,1,"My son loves these shoes so much, that when he grew out of them, we bought him another pair just like them. A good value!"
51844,1,I own three pair of these shoes. I bought them for over $50 each in a department store. Shows you how much I liked these shoes. Since Amazon has them at a lower cost I will probably buy a couple more pairs.
131066,1,"I have been wearing Clark's Natureveldt Oxfords for over 2 decades, and this is a great shoe.First, the price: Sure, they are pricey, but they more than make up for the added cost in comfort and durability. My first pair, which I bought for about 100 dollars, lasted me over 10 years! How many shoe brands last that long? I took regular care of them of course, adding dye and polish as needed. The sole finally wore out after 10 years of very comfortable use. I almost cried when the sole cracked, as I loved my Clark's shoes that much. So I went out and bought two more pairs, one brown (my favorite) and one black.These shoes are described as casual shoes, but I wear them with my suit and they look fine. Whether you wear then to a formal occasion or to the mall, they will look fashionable.These shoes are truly the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear. There is no ""break-in"" period with these shoes. The moment you put them on, you will feel how comfortable they are. The laces are top-quality as well, thick and strong, and will not break over years of use. The sole is very durable and literally will last 10 years. The stiching will not come loose or fray. Top-quality in every component of the shoe.I have no reservation in giving these shoes a 5-star rating. These are the best shoes I have ever worn.Jim ""konedog"" Koenig"
177924,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
197434,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
114796,1,"I had been looking for a pair of pink tennis shoes. Online I found the color that I wanted, I'm very pleased."
92383,0,I bought this for my husband to wear as work shoes as he is standing all day and he needs ankles support. The leather and manufacture seems pretty flimsy and smells really bad. And not like leather but like chemicals. The inside lining looks cheap. Too bad I bought two pairs.
171772,1,"I purchased this suit for my 17yr old. He wrestles tournament during the off season and summer, so he needed a suit. I also bought matching shoes. He thought the suit was just a comfortable as his regular suit and it didn't ride or pinch in the crotch area. My son has a tall and slender frame. He generally wrestles between 125 - 138. We ordered the medium and it fits great."
238622,1,"This is my second of these - it's the best front-pocket wallet I've run across. It's nice and thin, while still holding 6 or more various types of credit / ID cards. The only negative is that your cash is simply folded and placed into the main pocket of the wallet. When you pull out your bills, be careful - some may end up on the floor. As long as you're careful, though, it's terrific."
156953,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
11418,1,"Ellegant,great quality materials, excellent taste...pretty unique.I'm not a fan of that kind of ankle wrap,but this time, I simply didn't care."
96620,0,"Liked the way this shoe looked and the way it was made, but it ran very, very small and the opening was too small as well. Had to send them back."
33821,1,I enjoy my purple chucks a lot. I get lots of comments on them when I where them. It is fun to see peoples reactions.
374588,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
363431,1,"These shoes are great. I value a lightweight, sturdy, hightop shoe for playing basketball(prison rules style) with the 11 other firefighters I work with. They require a tough foot, but if you can hack it they will save you some money."
25876,1,"Well, i bought those shoes for my sister when they go onsale, roughtly 21$. Price is very good for addidas shoes, and the degisn is nice ,too. But only thing my sister does not like is the the plastic base. you feel it is prertty hard when you wear shoes. she like the softer heel."
196389,1,Ive been wearing converse all stars for over 20 years and still love them. Ive also found they make a nice driving shoe because there thin and you can feel the pedals. If youve never had a pair its time to try.
280192,1,Great shoes. comfortable and a good fit. I now own 5 pairs in different colors.
312687,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
79974,1,"I purchased these sandals as a gift for a friend...She is Very pleased with them and has worn them every day to work since I gave them to her this summer, and tells me every so often how much she loves those sandals! :)"
375601,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
117043,1,"I first purchased a pair of these Spira walking shoes about 5 years ago and the ones purchased from Amazon are my third pair. I turned to Amazon after my traditional source, a local shoe store, closed their doors after the owner died. I found it difficult to find another shoe store that carried them but was pleased to find them on Amazon. These shoes have patented springs built into the soles, which creates a sort of shock absorber for your feet and knees. You have no sensation of walking on springs, only comfort -- and they wear like iron. They are expensive but worth every penny and they last forever. I wear mine virtually every day and they always look like new even though I shovel snow in the winter and mow my lawn in the summer, all the time wearing these shoes. If they get a little scuffed, a little black shoe polish brings them back to like-new condition. Try a pair and you will not be sorry. I did find that they run a little small. I normally wear a 9-1/2 or 10 in a dress shoe, but I take a 10-1/2 in this shoe."
101675,1,these are good ballet slippers for the beginning and young ballet students. we have used this brand and style since my daughter started ballet at 3 and she is 6 1/2 now and they have held up well with classes and recitals.
336018,1,"Delivery was fast and these were exactly what I ordered. I use my crocs for gardening. Easy to clean off once they get muddy. Note that the color of these shoes online looks more coral, but once they arrived in the box they are definitely a true red. I look like Minnie Mouse!"
372759,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for most of my life. They aren't $15. anymore, but they are still worth the money. They are very flat, so don't forget to get some insoles with arches for them! You may want to add 1/2 a shoe size for this."
284914,0,"I started a tap class a few months ago. This is an adult beginner tap class, and our teacher likes to teach us new things to challenge us. The class is an hour a week, and I practice about an hour a day outside of that class time.The toe tap on the right shoe came loose after the 3rd class. And being riveted into the shoe, there was no way to re-attach the tap. Maybe I had the wrong size. Maybe I was being hard on them. But maybe they're just not meant to tap more than 5 hours per week either."
303461,1,"Great skate shoes, my son loves these. These were cheaper than alot of the others and we don't know why, they are GREAT sk8 shoes!"
330074,0,"i was so excited when i ordered these shoes. First of all, these shoes arrived a week after the estimated arrival which upset me greatly since i was highly eager. then when they finally got here,they sent me the wrong shoes! i ordered the patent shoes (shiny) and i even reviewed my order form to see if maybe it was an error on my part. and it wasnt i infact ordered the patent wedges and was sent the pu wedges (non shiny)>_&lt; the shoes non the less were very comfortable and since these shoes took so long to get here im not even going to return them who knows how long itll take before the new pair get here. then to top it off after trying them on and modeling them around the house to show them to my family the label inside the shoe peeled off....in short, beautiful shoe, very comfortable.terrible service."
86275,1,"These are by far the most comfortable shoes. For someone who is on her feet daily they wear exceptionally well, the suede goes well with any type of brown and the support is invigorating."
137865,1,I am a fan of Keds and have several pairs of Keds shoes on different colors. They are true size and fit my feet very well. I wear them every morning for exercise and got much compliance. Highly recommend them for active women.
385069,1,A friend of mine was wearing these when I was visiting her on vacation and I commented how cute they were. She immediately took them off and said I had to try them because they are so comfortable. As soon as I did I had to have them! It also was great that they came in my favorite color. I also like the idea they are made out of recycled yoga mats! Enjoy!
252226,1,These shoes are very hard to come by .My husband use to wear these butThe stores stop carry them so guess who has them . A very nice shoeI will buy several pair
143283,1,These boots are really cute! the little pull handles should make it easy for the little one to put on.
374960,1,"The shoewallet is a great little item! I debated between this and a similar product, but I chose the shoewallet because in addition to holding my Nike+ipod sensor it also has room for my house key and a photo ID (very helpful!). Not only is the product really good, but the customer service has been excellent. I've already recommended it to several of my friends who run frequently. :)"
6601,1,Lots of copy cats out there but there's nothing like the real Sperries. We were really happy to find them so reasonably priced.
3479,1,"My husband loved his first pair of these boots so much, when he wore them out, he wanted another pair. So we ordered them online at Amazon.com, great price and quick service."
389365,1,Needed a wide cleat for my son and these definitely fit the bill. Held up under pretty constant use. I will be purchasing these again next soccer season.
103981,1,I like these pair of sandals because they do not hurt my feet.
219164,1,This is a most comfortable shoe with great support for an excellent price. My friend went out and bought a pair after seeing how the shoe moved with the foot.
66434,1,"I bought the green shoe. First, it's really good but I mainly run on the hard concrete so it probably wasn't the shoe for me.I can't tell you how well it works off road, but on the road, my knees take a beating due to the lack of padding. These shoes definitely weren't designed for distances of over two miles on the road. Right now, I mainly use them for sprint workouts which they excell at. They are very flexible and lightweight so it's almost like running barefoot and is excellent training for calf muscles.I haven't got a chance to use the spikes but without the spikes, they have traction on snow and ice due to the metal on the bottom."
318548,1,the sandal is so sexy and i love it!!! thank you amazon for the prompt delivery... will surely shop again...
336996,1,i love these shoes. i ware them alot. i have three pairs red black and royal blue. one bad thing about them is you can not get shoelaces for them in the stores. i had to get them offline.
155483,1,"Initially the item was not delivered to the requested address; since the seller is using the USPS, which is not as efficient as UPS or DHL; however the seller made all efforts to track the item and finally was located in some post office and I have to go my self and collect it.For deliveries, I would suggest to the seller, to use UPS or DHL even if you charge the client the additional cost."
323522,0,"Bought these and thought they would be good quality, but when I got them, the stitching wasn't so good. It was coming apart in some places."
286974,1,"Received sandals very fast and fit perfectly. Wish the straps would stay up so I can slip on faster, but overall a good buy."
328715,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
44069,1,its a good place to buy ur shoes u get ur products on time.
300375,1,"Thanks a lot!!! Good brand, good shoes, I like it very much! Classic shoes, I recomendate this item to my friends!"
329655,1,"I have 2 pair of Chacos and I love them both, but these are so pretty and go with almost everything in my wardrobe. I have a pair of W9 and I like them, but even tho my foot is narrow these are almost too narrow, so with my Serenity pair I bought the W8 wide and I could live in them! They are so comfy and wonderful for living in the mountains!"
221242,1,"These shoes have been my mainstay dress shoe when I need to wear something fancier than the beaten-up dansko clogs that I usually wear to work. They were very comfortable when I first got them and they are even more comfortable 2 years after the fact. I wear them all day while standing up and shuffling between distant points at the workplace and my feet hold up, no problem. Good looking, and well-constructed shoe.Great shoe, great value!"
96752,1,"This is a nice sturdy shoe, but no matter that it is advertised as a ""slip-on"", a shoe horn is very much needed to put it on."
270778,1,I spend a lot of time on my feet and have worn some other shoes out in less than two months. Have had at least 7 pair of the Akrons and will continue to purchase them. The factory soles are thinner than the replacements that I get but they are very comfortable. I've had some that I've re-soled 3 or 4 times. With a little care the tops still look good after daily use for a couple of years.I will be back for more.
47220,1,"Whether you're buying them for military service, or just wearing them for the style like myself, you can't go wrong with boots like these. Solid, sturdy, and comfortable... when properly laced these boots grip the calf, and after a short break-in period, are as comfortable as sneakers. The cost only reflects the quality of the product... I may not be buying another pair of boots ever again."
389028,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
362810,1,"These were my first converse, and I was a bit hesitant to buy a pair online, so I went to Khols and tried on a pair there to find the correct size. I bought the Black Monochrome, and they are stylish and comfortable. And look great! I have had several compliments on them in the first week or so. A great buy!"
185214,1,"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
229226,1,"These boot moccasins by Minnetonka are great! I've been wearing them since high school. Feels like walking around in your slippers-- there so comfortable! Unique frontier, hippie type look that goes great with denim (faded looks best) and leather--particularly in fall and spring. More guys should try them out for a unique, confortable look."
145474,0,"I suspect the vendor sold out of these, so just sent any size they could. Cute boot, but sketchy vendor."
24105,1,THESE REVIEWS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER! SO DISREGARD THE PREVIOUS 2 REVIEWS! ALL PROPET SHOES ARE FABULOUS! QUALITY & COMFORT! AND NO- I'M NOT AFFILIATED WITH PROPET IN ANY WAY! JUST AN EXTREMELY SATISFIED CUSTOMER OF ALL PROPET SHOES FOR 8 YEARS NOW :)
27724,0,I'm giving this shoe 3 stars for one reason. The width runs too narrow. I have had a similar sizing problem in the past and that was with Reebok. Otherwise it is a very attractive and comfortable shoe that looks like it it will last for a long time.
188765,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
354794,1,"These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color. My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them. I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon). They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain."
24824,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
179642,1,These shoes are light and comfortable to walk around in all day. Thier sizing is a little confusing. These run about one size larger than most shoes. I recommend using extra or replacement insoles.
242054,1,"Don't know how many pairs ive owned over the years but I keep buying more. Comfy, stylish and cool to boot. I'd give a 5 but i wish they werent as expensive..."
194272,1,"These moccasins are very comfortable right out of the box. This is my second pair, but the first pair lasted about 15 years. Excellent product."
153853,1,"Love these boots! I made the mistake, though, of listening to reviewer's comments suggesting that the boots run large so they should be bought a half to full size smaller. I normally wear a 7, so I ordered a 6, and they were too small. I immediately returned them for a refund, then had to place a new order since a direct exchange wasn't possible. My 7 has now arrived. I'm extremely happy with them, and wear them all day and evening. By the way, I also bought an UGG care kit from a different seller. When I sprayed the mist, I noticed that the boots were not absorbing the liquid; it just beaded on the surface. This suggests that the boots may have already been treated. If I had known this ahead of time I would not have spent the additional $20+ for a care kit."
51238,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
120055,1,"I wear an 8 in some shoes and 7.5 in others. I ordered a half size smaller than that, a size 7 and they are a bit tight but am keeping them because I know they will stretch out some. Cute and comfy otherwise."
179054,1,"great boots, if they fit. had to send them back cuz they ran too small by one size"
233769,1,This is a great shoe that my wife has worn for years and is no longer available locally. This was a grat price and arrived very quickly. We will buy again.
280896,1,"I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality. They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store. I'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe, or just aren't familiar with ked's. Also, the sizes are the same as normal ked's. I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small. I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear, and they're too loose. I'll keep them anyway because they're so inexpensive, but I wish I hadn't listened. Probably unrelated, but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48. Excellent shipping."
364013,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
379588,1,"My first time wearing them I thought I need a wider pair but then the second time was better and so forth, I truly enjoy my shoes. They come a half size bigger, remember that when ordering : )"
279611,1,"The shoe looks nice and is very comfortable. I thought it would be a little dressier, so that is why I don't give it 5 stars. I don't have any real complaints about the show. It's a solid black shoe that does well in most situations other than situations where you really need a more formal shoe."
344312,1,Bought these for Christmas for my 13 year old daughter and they were a huge hit.
330888,1,"Justin Ropers are the most comfortable boots there are out there. I wear Justin's everyday to ride in, weekends to show in, and also to just go out. You will not find a more comfortable and sharp looking combination and the affordable price of a Justin."
170986,0,I usually only rock Nike but I had a brief affair with Pony. These are almost exactly like Nike Air Force One for the budget minded people. I compared the 2 and they were almost identical. All I really have to say about these.
337543,1,love my boots they got here a day before time! im very pleased. everywhere else wanted 98 dollars for them but i got them for 48 dollars here! im super stoked
291811,1,"The boots I received for child, were high quality and were delivered very quickly. This was my second order from this company and I am pleased with their service."
361279,1,"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for Christmas. He usually is between a 11 and 11.5 in Sperrys, so listening to the other reviews, I got him a 10.5 in these. They fit well! I ordered the dark brown (not the dark brown lariat) and they still ended up looking a little more red in color than I had imagined. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the way the sole looks; it isn't exactly as pictured and looks a little cheaper. He seems to like the shoes though, says they are comfortable too. Will update if there are any issues with them in the future."
84073,0,"These shoes have been great for work, but they only lasted about 6 months. Granted, I do work in a laboratory dealing with coal, limestone, and various other matrices, but I would think the soles of a good shoe would last longer than these have. With that being said, the shoes are comfortable and are definitely stain-resistant. I've spilled or dripped many different acids and caustics on them over the past 6 months and they've held up well (except for the soles, of course). These are good work shoes if you don't mind replacing them every 6 months."
156706,0,"This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price. But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B. A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available. Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days. I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present."
284128,1,"Super light, Amazing grip, and just AWESOME! I wear these shoes whenever I go trail running. I have some gnarly hills behind my house and these shoes give great grip when I'm sprinting up those long steep dirt hills. I absolutely love 'em! And I'd buy more pairs when/if mine dies out on me. Still going strong."
144216,1,"OMG these are the best boots i have ever bought!! they are so warm and comfortable .. i cant explain in words how fantastic they are!! I only wish that i jumped on the ""ugg""ly boot bandwagon last year!! I got the Chocolate, mainly because i know that the sand can stain easier and i personally prefer darker shoes. I am so happy with my purchase i think i might be getting some family members a pair for the holiday! i do agree to order one size smaller, i was hesitant, because i have large feet (10) but the 9 fits like a glove.you will not regret this purchase!!"
4006,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
10160,1,"My eight year old received these for Christmas and wears them constantly. They are durable, comfortable and look great! I did order them in his actual size and found them to be roomy, but with a heavy sock it's fine. He absolutely adores them!"
1313,0,"I have only had these shoes for a short time and maybem they need to br broke in a little, but the arch area is a little uncomfortable."
34326,1,lasted through 4 years of high school wrestling and I've got no complaints. They're still in one piece which is more than I can say for the 2 backpacks I went through. Can't ask for anything more than that.
252852,1,"**If you've never tried these on and want to order them online, I usually wear a 11.5 but I wear these in a 10.5**Just a few words for this purchase. The shoes look great and break in really well. They go good with just about any type of pants in any color (except the exact color of the shoe). If you're going to buy them online use the Amazon 20% off shoe coupon and you can get them for around 61 dollars.That's all!"
261334,1,Great boots for fishing! I was using Vikings and XtraTuffs which were both heavy and uncomfortable. These are so comfy! I'm used to peeling my boots off after a day of fishing and being in relief that I can put on tennis shoes. Not with these! I fished four days straight and my feet were loving them!
301625,1,"Keen makes the best outdoor footware PERIOD! Excellent workmanship, great support and they last, do yourself a favor, buy a pair of Keen's"
144206,1,I have wanted these boots forever! I am ready for warm feet! I did not order a size down mainly because they didn't go below a size 5! They fit great! I have a very high arch and tend to have problems with boots! Not these boots!!
120163,0,Sized small.. Little toe on left foot hangs out No way to get full foot into it. This is my third Olowahu Flip FLop. The first was great and lasted forever. The second was like this one. Wore heal down in 3 months. Small Little Left Toe wont go into shoe or stay there if forced. Tore my little toenail back attempting to wear. I love Teva but wont buy another pair of these.
68725,0,This brush does a great job but once you mount it to the ground it's hard to clean out the trapped dirt residue.
284787,1,I have two pairs of Creation 8. I have a Wave Creation 7 that is also very good. But Creation 8 is even better. I just love it!!!!
373269,1,Although my wife only gave this shoe a rating of 4 she loves them! She actually purchased them to wear with a Disco costume. She received great comments on the shoes. The only thing she was disappointed in was that the shoe was not available in half sizes. I had to order one size up so the shoe was actually big. She has a narrow foot and the front of the shoe is very wide so her foot was slipping through the front. She said they were very comfortable and she was able to wear them most of the night.
159002,1,"These Chucks are top of the line, very comfortable, still rocking my cons five years strong, the great thing is you can walk in these cons all day with no discomfort or pain. GET THEM!"
107262,1,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
282157,1,"Very pleased with this purchase, great shoes, love the quality of Clarks! The Desert Treks are just as they say they are...GREAT SHOES!!"
200222,1,"This product was exactly what I expected. They are well made, comfortable and offerd at a reasonable price for the product."
362095,1,These were a gift for my son....he's been using them and says they're very comfortable with a good grip. Highly recommended.
128361,1,These are pretty comfortable sandals but they are very narrow. If you have a wide foot you would find this to be a problem. I've gotten used to them but I wish they had been a little wider
48929,1,"My order came in the original package and box (New!) Love the Sebago Dockside's. I have owned several pairs of the years. The only drawback is you have to wear them a lot at first to break them down because they will hurt your heels a bit for a few days, but after that you're good to go. They look absolutely awesome and go with any style you want to rock them with. Definitely recommend them."
83289,1,This was a gift so I can't testify to its durability but I slipped these on after I gave them to my sister in law. They were so comfortable. I'd love to have a pair for myself.
47150,1,This shoe holds up well under my 210 pound frame. The shoe also supports my orthotics well and fits perfectly (I am actually about a size 12 1/2). I still think this is the best heavy duty shoe for the money.
277879,1,"As most of the other reviews state, these are nice boots - both in looks and quality - for the price. I compared these boots directly with the more expensive Timberland White Ledge boots. I was disappointed with the Timberlands' cheap materials and construction. The Hi-Tec boots are clearly superior.However, if you have wide feet and order the wide model, know that you will not receive true wide (i.e. EE or W sizes) boots. Unlike the properly wide Timberlands, the wide version of the Hi-Tec boots are only slightly wider than a medium width set of shoes.The only other complaint I have for these boots is that they lack loops on the back to help slip them on/off.As for sizing, I find these boots comparable with Nike's sizing or 1/2 size bigger than New Balance or Timberland, e.g. Hi-Tec boots sized 9.5 are about 9.5 Nike, 9 New Balance, or 9 Timberland.If you need properly wide boots, I recommend Merrell as they accommodate wide feet very well."
305716,1,This is by far the most comfortable shoe..It is a outstanding walking shoedoes not need to be broken in...ready to walk or just wear
16115,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
32587,1,These boots are as cute as can be! Got them for my 10 yo daughter and she loves them. The stitching is nicely done and the silver toe tip dresses them up. She says they are very comfortable.
270806,1,They were well worth the price. Very comfortable and arrived timely. No problems with the fit. It was true to size.
68194,1,"Well made and durable. I was a little worried when I first purchased these because they look bulky and heavy, but the look and feel are amazing, definitely not heavy or bulky. Very comfortable for a long day moving around on your feet."
220682,1,Just love these shoes. They are very light and look great. Will order them again!
149850,0,"I bought these shoes over the summer to replace my NewBalance shoes. I figured the build quality would be similar and was just looking to save $20 or $30. Unfortunately, these shoes were a bit of a disappointment. I had them for about a week and the toe part of the shoe somehow tore. Then, about 2 weeks later, the heel part of the shoe came apart. I've only had these shoes for about 3 months and they're already completely work out. Next time I'll spend the extra money to get a pair of NewBalance shoes. I'd suggest you do the same."
28843,2,"The fit of these is not bad, I have no complaints - otherwise I wouldn't have bought them in the first place.However, the reason why I decided to go out of my way to rate these is because I believe the materials used in these shoes are susceptible to and promote shoe odor. Now, you say...""that's a matter of opinion and for all I know, your feet just stank!"" Two things: 1) I tend to be obsessive about hygiene. 2) I have a number of dress shoes of other brands that have seen a lot more usage than these, and have NOT this problem.I bought these no more than a month ago, and the best way to describe this odor is a strong ""new shoe smell,"" which escapes the shoe, even if you're wearing them! Sitting at a desk I can smell it, and it drives me quite simply nuts. I suspect that these shoes are awful breathers...as the feet do get noticeably more hot and sweaty, reacting with the materials (upper portion of the inside, I believe), giving the end result.Curious to know if there's anyone else with this issue.The only reason I wouldn't rate these a one is because they do look good and fit well. But the odor is a deal breaker. Using some Odor Eater insoles at the moment. Will report back later with the findings."
299102,1,"I purchase this shoes for work, they are very comfortable very good quality, a really recommended, it also look very goon on khakis."
336592,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
292861,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
389823,1,I find these shoes to be the most comfortable things in the world. They complement my clothes very well. But the down side is that with all of the snow we have recieved here on the east coast....wearing them outside is not a good idea. Especially if you want to keep you feet warm. But all in all.....I love my shoes.
228344,1,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
356176,1,After a little breaking in theses are easily the best sandles I have ever owned! I especially love the cork foot bed and how it contours to your foot!
133468,0,I love these shoes but they only last me about 4 months before the soles crack all the way across the bottom of the shoes where you bend at the toes. I have purchased several pairs of these shose because they are comfortable and are exactly what I was looking for. I am a small framed 110 lb female who wears these shoes for work several days a week and I wish the soles held up better.
183345,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
206314,0,"These shoes are fine if you can get the right size. I've ordered several in the same size and they were actually different. Watch the Youth versus Adult as they vary in width, but not length in the same size. They are a great shoe to wear in the summer, they dry quickly and can just get washed with the hose."
265577,1,Pretty comfortable from day one. I wish I would have searched the web more. Found them 20 bucks cheaper after purchasing these.
178203,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
257565,1,I bought my son his first pair of these and he wore them out (it took awhile and he wore them almost daily) The shoe is well constructed and he says they are very comfortable. They are a masculine looking sandal and perfect for everything from taking out the trash to wearing on a walk.
4983,1,"I use this shoe for training and for racing, for long runs and for interval workouts. My weekly mileage is in the 30-38 mile range, and the Green Silence is a nice, light ride. I believe the weight is advertised as 8.3 ounces, and without getting out my wife's food scale, I'd say that's a pretty accurate estimate. My sense is that there's a limit to the number of miles I'd take this shoe. The cushioning is limited, but the overall feel is pleasantly surprising. Short distances feel really smooth; longer distances slightly less so, compared to traditional trainers. The payoff, though, is the lightweight feel and speed--the exact qualities I want in a shoe when I'm looking to do faster training."
161777,1,"This is the second pair of this shoe that I have ordered; the first being black and brown. They are great for travel when trying to minimize the amount to take as they look great with all colors of slacks. Walking a yellow lab took it's toll on the soles (rubber) so the tops still looked good when the heels were shot. Overall, excellent value."

323880,1,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
47358,1,"I went to a running store a few years ago to get fitted for a shoe. Not only did I find out that I was wearing the wrong size for most of my life, I found a shoe that catered to my wide foot and gave me arch support. The Brooks Beast is the only running shoe I will buy. They have done a good job over the years making them lighter, but the comfort level and feel when running is awesome."
211042,1,The skin is really soft.The shoes look better than in the picture.The color Carmel looks amazing on my mom's feet.
191058,1,Very cute! My 6 year old gets so many positive comments every time she wears them. Good quality. We both love them.
322765,1,"I bought these winter boots for my 6yr old and I have to honestly say they are wonderful. These boots are warm and stylish. They do run a little small, I got a size 10 for my daughter which runs half a size big on her and I had to return them and get them 11.5 which is a bit roomy but with winter socks she'll be o.k. and worth buying."
112838,1,"I love this sandal, so much that I bought 2. Very comfy with cute sparkles."
140518,1,I love these shoes. I have about 5 pairs and I wear every day for about 6 months out of the year. Very comfy and much much better than the single strap kind. Of all the teva's I have a had (and its a lot) this is my favorite style.
68158,1,"I now have several pairs of Bonnie Lite Oxford Shoes - because when I find a shoe that is comfortableand in wide width, I purchase several at a time. I have black and brown. They are just right forwalking in big department stores and malls, as well as in my neighborhood. Comfort is importantto me, but also support and ""looks."" These shoes fill the bill for me. I hope to purchase navy andred when they are available!"
158211,1,The shoes are very cool. And so is the price. Fast shipping also.
195491,1,American made union made quality boots great material/I previously had timberland proline the sole tore in under a year. Redwings are being made in china now too.For high quality boots like these you're paying the same price as those competitors. Never go back to those shotty made in foreign sweatshop timberlands. what was i thinking?Customer for life!
46761,1,They are a little big but that is o.k. he will use them later on. I like the fact that they are a solid color which is the school requirement. Great quality!
293039,1,"These are exactly what my son wanted, and they are classic Dr. Martens boots. He keeps coming back to them, and they're always just right."
233688,1,"Absolutely love these bad boy vegan shoes, sole is stitched (always good to look for in a durable shoe) and after 6 months they are really holding up well!"
244664,1,This is one of the best USA made work boots. It is hard to beat considering the price and quality. My only complaint is the inside toe area should be lined in leather instead of thin cotton. The cotton lining wears too quickly. I am wearing my second pair and would buy a third.
108575,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
336104,0,"I purchased one pair for my mum a few months ago, those were made in Italy and they're great! So I ordered a econd pair, just got them and they're made in Mexico and are like the Italy ones, this are mush smales (even they're the same size) and les wider. Wish I had know this before and I would have not purchased them......"
210058,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
48996,2,"shoes, hard, rough, uncomfortable to use, they have hurt my feet, and I have almost no use them; regret that a brand like SEBAGO have concessions that discredit, I hope they give me some alternative change, thanks."
277957,1,"Had these for a little over six months now. I've been hiking in the forest, rock hopping, walking all day in the city in these shoes. My feet have never hurt after wearing them all day."
113804,1,"This boot is Great!I work 12 hour shifts, Very comfortable and keep feet dry. Soft leather make break in time easy. Have looked at other boots and feel this is the best boot for the buck. Sears use to sell this boot off the shelf and no longer do, witch left me looking on the web. Amazon had the best price and best policy for returns. Thank You Amazon!"
215075,1,"Bought these boots for my first winter in Minnesota. They are easy to pull on and off, keep my feet toasty, and look good, too!"
7796,1,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
17833,1,"It's very warm and nice looking, but it runs a bit small. Order a half size up."
330306,0,"Rockport Men's Margin Oxford: Comfortable, good show. but heals and sole of foot wear through. Rockport needs to improve on this."
323297,1,"I love these slippers, I've been looking fora a pair with leather soles for quite some time. Only problem is I disregarded the other comments about buying a bigger size. I have small feet and never have to worry about sizes being too small so with no 1/2 sizes available I went with my normal size. The first time I put them on it was like having my feet bound! The leather is stretching slowly and after ~2 weeks are quiet comfortable (doubtless they will mold perfectly to my feet with a little more time), but if I had simply purchased one size up I could have skipped the stretching phase..."
291301,1,"Good basic slipper. I'm a size 8 1/2 and bought the large...OKAY fit, maybe could have gone up a size since they are pretty close to the toes, but overall comfortable."
387126,1,"I like the comfort, warmth, and paddingof these slippers. They're easy to slip onand off."
335320,1,I bought these for my wife who is normally a ladies size 6. I bought her a big girls size 6 and they are actually a little big. Look to be about 1/2 size larger than normal shoe size for my wife. She is happy. Quality and Comfort is high as expected from Teva.
152861,1,"Purchased these for my 21 yr old daughter for Christmas. She loves them, says that they are soo comfortable."
261424,1,"the only problem i had with this shoe was the sizing, i usually wears 8 or 8.5 but the size i bought was 5.5 so it was a little bit unusual!!!"
363043,1,"I have always loved chucks, they are a classic. If you need more support in the arch, you can always add an arch support or insert. For me, they run true to size. A half size smaller is to narrow, since they run narrow in the toe anyway. I have wide feet, so if your feet are narrow, maybe this would not apply to you."
316700,1,My Reebok Mid cut Hightop sneakers are very comfortable and lightweight. I love wearing them because I have weak ankles and being mid cut they give my ankles the support I need. I would recomend these sneakers to anyone who has weak ankles.Thank YouCherokee Indian
311546,1,"Clarks used to be exclusively made in Britain or Ireland. Most Clarks sold in the US nowadays are made in China. The Parthenon is Chinese made, but so far as I can tell, the quality is as high as any Clarks made elsewhere. The British-made Clarks used the European scale and a size 8 on the European scale is almost like a size 8.5 to size 9 on the American scale. These Parthenons run true to the American scale and come in only medium width.I've worn these Clarks Parthenon boots almost everyday for four to five months. I can unabashedly say these are the most comfortable footwear I've ever worn. The shape of the footbed fit my feet like a custom fit. I am kind of a heel striker when I walk and these shoes have eliminated the heel and ankle pain I used to experience when walking on concrete pavement for more than 10 minutes. The polyurethane outer sole is very durable compared to those cheap Walmart or Kmart shoes. In fact the polyurethane outer soles seem to be more durable than the Vibram soles on my expensive hiking boots! The full grain leather upper is supple and does not require break-in. It isn't all that waterproof even when copiously coated with a waterproofing wax polish. I think the water comes in through the stitchings. On rainy days I usually have to wear something else.The brown style is dressy enough that they work equally well with my formal suits as with my khakis and blue jeans, but somehow the black style doesn't look good on me, especially not when I'm wearing suits. I can't explain why but the brown style just looks much better all around. The only real downside with these boots is that, since they are only half-high, my wool slacks almost invariably ride up and get caught at the top of the boots whenever I sit down and then get up. This always requires me to use my hands to fix. For this reason, I sometimes wish they were either just plain shoes or full-height boots and not half-height boots. The plus side is that half-height boots breathe much better and feel much less clammy than full-height boots. All in all, I am willing to put up with this inconvenience for the unparalleled comfort that these boots have offered my tender feet.I have since ordered 4 more pairs, two in black and two in brown just in case Clarks discontinues this model. I just couldn't resist the massively discounted prices from $40 to $60 a pair when Amazon ran those special promotions. Boots that fit my feet this well are hard to come by at any price."
127194,1,"I bought these for my son who will wear them rain, shine, or snow. He likes steel toes (the steel covers his toes more completely and the soles have better traction than the Dunham work shoes he had previously) and he doesn't mind that they are heavier than some shoes because they protect his feet so much better. The shoes are well built and give good support. This will be the only pair of shoes he plans to wear for the next year and they look like they'll last that long. It took a bit to break them in, but for a work/general purpose shoe it wasn't a lot of time. If you want light weight shoes these are not them. If you want something that will protect your feet better than the average athletic shoe on the otherhand...."
213318,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
224767,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
301069,1,Just what i was looking for. the product is in perfect condtion.i have been looking for these shoes for WEEKS and no one had my size.im really happy with my purchase
287869,2,"These are well-made, nice looking casual shoes. I've had them about 2 months now and they're holding up great. I work in the office and wear these about 3-4 days a week. My biggest complaint is that there is no cushioning in the shoes. The insole is very thin. After 1 week I bought Dr. Scholl's gel insoles just so these would feel comfortable. I wear these for about 9-10 hours per day so comfort is very important to me. The shoes are slightly longer than other shoes I've purchased, but I've been told that Clarks tend to run long. The soles don't have much tread, so I wonder what they'll be like on snowy and icy sidewalks this winter."
258936,1,"Shoes arrived in original box; pristine condition; exactly what I ordered.HOwever, we ordered the wrong size. Return was handled well; account to be credited for purchase price only. No shoes in stock in the size we needed, and it would be spring before any more arrived. When you see your size, order it ASAP."
220120,1,"The size fits perfectly, the color is exactly like the picture, and above all it's super super cute.Makes me want to purchase another color!"
232035,1,"Acquired as a gift for my son, who is an accomplished soccer player, and he uses them all the time. Great gift."
41843,1,"I am not sure why, but these particular shoes are getting rather difficult to find in retail stores in our area. I am on my feet a lot at work and do a lot of walking. For the price, these are probably the most comfortable and long lasting shoe I have ever worn. I have several pair of them because when I do find them, I buy two pair at a time.I must admit to being rather rough on shoes but these things hold up just as well as shoes that I have paid four and five times more for.These shoes give you plenty of toes room and the cushioning is wonderful. I tend to land rather hard on my heels when I walk and the cushion in these shoes is perfect.Of course as the shoes become a bit worn for the work place, they go into my outdoor walking and scrounging around shoe pile; they work wonderfully for that purpose also. The sole is quite even and stable which helps prevent ankle strain or sprain when moving over rough ground. I have one old pair; really, really old and beat-up, which I use for my creek wading. Of course it does take awhile to wear a pair of these out and they clean up quite well using only a damp cloth and a brushing now and then.For the price it is really rather difficult to beat these things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
341847,1,"Bought two pair of the shoes, alternating them for work. I love them. The black ones are sharp and both are very comfortable and convient to slip on and rush out the door if I have to. I suffer from pain in my achilles heel and the slip on design has certainly relieved this discomfort. The price was great and there was very little wait time for either pair."
72702,0,"I love these Eastland shoes but can't seem to find them anymore. I was excited to see them on Amazon as my old pair is looking quite worn. When I got them, they were too small! I guess I learned my lesson and won't purchase shoes online again. I just did my first ever return to Amazon and will see how that goes. By the way, I have worn the same size shoes for years!"
281202,1,"I received these shoes for Christmas and had to order another pair because they didn't fit. Sizes run big, I'm a size 13 and fit comfortably in a 12. My one gripe with this shoe is that you should wear mid-ankle or higher socks because lower styles tend to get bunched up. The only reason for 4 stars is that the sizes are big and it kept me from wearing these shoes a month ago! I will be buying more of Clark's brand."
135090,1,"I bought these for my boyfriend and when he first saw them he got the ""what ugly thing did you buy for me on Amazon?"" look on his face....but then he tried them on and now he wears them every night! I bought him the large size, his shoe size is around a ten usually....they fit perfect and as I said he loves them!"
37494,1,Title says it all. I had a pair of Nike sneakers that finally bit the dust after 4 years so I ordered these bad boys. After some breaking in they're by far my most worn shoes - they're ridiculously comfortable and the understated black design goes with almost anything I'm wearing. The huge 'tongue' can be annoying but it also makes these shoes very easy to slip into without having to untie the laces.
123751,1,These shoes are sweet. I also recommend the Garnet B-Ball Shoes.
15622,1,"My daughter wears high tops all the time. Nice to find this neutral color. She enjoys the converse brand, they hold up well."
348957,1,"These shoes are comfortable for getting around. Since it is a mans shoes I normally order down one size. There were no tens so I ordered the 10.5. The shoe fit fine, the 10 would not have given me the same comfort. I would recommend this as a walking shoe."
141485,1,This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out. I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle.
141797,1,Good value for the money. The soles provide more support than I anticipated. The only drawback is that they are definitely not as stylish as I had hoped.
258890,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
118704,1,"Definitely recommend. They might be just a little smaller then the street shoes, I bought size 13 for my daughter who normally wears size 11-12. There is some room to grow, not too much, just right. I had her foot measured at the store before purchasing and would recommend everyone to do so."
276416,1,"I was amazed at how light these boots are. Since I know my size perfectly when ordering boots thru the mail, they fit perfectly and are very very comfortable."
5818,1,"I really wish I could buy these sandals again. They are extremely comfortable and I love to carry a couple shots of rum to the beach with my when I go. I just grab me a soda and open my sandal and pour in a shot, its also a nice way to get your day goin when I crash at a friends house, if I wake up really thirsty I got myself a shot or 2 to put in my early saturday morning drink."
248074,1,Very competive prices and quick service equals a firm I will continue to do business with
226151,1,Very cute my husband is 67 but he still loves his converse allstars! Thanks!! Every thing is up to loving!
177453,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
10173,1,"My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day. He wanted ""work"" boots so he could be like his Daddy. Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long. He is very hard on footwear, but so far these seem to be holding up well. He even wears them to school on days he doesn't have gym."
172582,1,"I'm old fashioned I guess. I can't stand most new tennis shoe designs, I think most are downright ugly. These Reebocks are old school design, no nonsense, just comfortable shoes. I have been buying and wearing this style Reebock for at least twenty years. I hope Reebock keeps making them for another twenty years."
202881,1,"I bought a pair for me and another for my wife just before leaving for vacation to Hawaii and we are really happy with the result.The shoes are really comfortable and the feet can ""breathe"". The cord to tie is very useful and they are also waterproof!The only con is that it is really easy to get sand and pebbles depending on where you are and removing them is not that easy."
268783,1,"Since Rockport introduced the Men's ProWalker, I have purchased at least a dozen pairs. They are the most comfortable leisure shoe I have worn. They are durable and have a long life for everyday wearing. In today's economy, one can be sure of getting his money's worth in value."
201524,1,"I've had these for about 2 years now and I love them. Sperry's are comfy and go with everything. I wear them most everyday and I don't even think about it. I had the classic sahara color for a long time and decided to go a little more riske. Well this color is nearly as traditional and the contrast sole is a great look. They match with everything, and arguably with more than my sahara sperry's that look a little too similar to khaki color pants. Love them"
60639,1,"Bought as a gift for father who actually requested another pair of Hi-Tec boots for Christmas but after reading reviews regarding foot and ankle support selected the Altitude IV instead. Size fit great, color was dark chocolate and best of all was delivery... bought last minute before Christmas and was delivered to my house on Christmas Eve! Highly recommend for mountain hiking via my dad's comments."
133319,1,"After reading all the size discrepancy I was nervous about what size to get. I finally measured her foot with amazon's kids foot size measuring print out. According to that she was a size 11, 11.5, although her shoes she wears to school every day are size 10 and still are roomy! So I ordered 11's and they fit perfectly. I could have gone to 11.5 to have growing room, but the 11's are great and I didn't want to deal with the hassle, we'll just know to go a tad bigger next time. And, she loves the flowers on the inside, she mentions them every time she talks to people about taking ballet: ""And my shoes have FLOWERS inside them!"" So cute."
243904,1,"I am a highschool junior, who didn't start seriously running until track season of last year. I have a wide foot with low arches, and some amount of overpronation. I tried several pairs of Asics and Nikes last spring and over the summer, yet my knees were always sore, I was having ankle injuries, shin splints, etc. Finally, come XC season this year, one of the salesmen at a local shoe store told me I ""had to try"" these shoes. They were perfect. The shoes are supportive without being restrictive, and they corrected my overpronation without feeling unnatural (which was my complaint with one pair of Nikes I had.) These shoes have held up well. I've ran on average a little over 40 miles per week from the beginning of August until the middle of November and continued to run a little less than that for these past two weeks, and the shoes have held up very well. They feel as if they could very easily hold up another running season, though I've just ordered another pair of the same shoes to replace them.The shoes are supportive, yet non-restrictive and also light weight. The only complaint I have about them is that they seem to retain odor more than most running shoes. If you have feet that start to smell really bad (like mine) plan on using shoe deodorant.This is an excellent shoe for those with low arches, especially, but not only, those who require a wide toe box."
327943,1,"first of all, i am a big soccer fan and i have been playing the sport for more than 12 years, i play at least 3 times a week so i have tried aloooooooooooot of shoes,dont bother by the nike crab ( except for the talaria model for its light weight 7 lb ! ) ... this addidas shoe is really great, gives you great grib on the ball thanks to the leather exterior and curivng of the side. when you try it you might find it heavy so give it time (two games max) and you will see . great heel support and for the fashon lovers its nice looking."
362712,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
233892,1,"I wear these shoes everyday and I am on my feet most of the day. I have tried different shoes and I always come back to these. They last me about 5-6 months. Once the insole support is gone, I have to get a new pair. Aftermarket inserts don't work. It would be nice if they had a little more ventilation as they get hot when the weather is warmer. Good traction on ice and snow."
217273,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
81134,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
44239,1,"lighter and more breathable than anything i've worn before (great for hot summer days) - so comfortable, it's hard not to wear them around casually - i hope they hold up for awhile, but i'm ready to buy a new pair when these wear out - definitely buy .5-1 size bigger as recommended"
314617,1,"Wow, my first review. Naturally, I would review the T-Macs first, but I just love the Reebok Amaze classics. I got the baby blue and white. If you cool ghetto and urban, defintely it's a pick up. Comfortable, stylish, good ankle support, and lasts for a long time. I just keep buying more of it."
150749,1,"I love these shoes. They're great for walking all day, and I like the fact that the straps are adjustable in three different areas. And they're so cute!"
357746,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
371231,1,Received when they said it would be here... was exactly what they said it would be... and I am totally happy with it...
11183,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
95227,1,These are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn. They fit perfectly. Could walk around with these all day.
114115,1,"I now have several pairs of Bonnie Lite Oxford Shoes - because when I find a shoe that is comfortableand in wide width, I purchase several at a time. I have black and brown. They are just right forwalking in big department stores and malls, as well as in my neighborhood. Comfort is importantto me, but also support and ""looks."" These shoes fill the bill for me. I hope to purchase navy andred when they are available!"
180363,1,Paid prioty post for this as had no choice . It cost $50. Double the price of the shoes. The shoes above I paid for the slower postage. It cost $19 for the three pairs. Was told they would arrive in about 3 weeks. The boots in 3 to 4 days. The boots arrived as said and three other pairs arrived the very Next Day!!!!! Felt totally ripped off in regards to the boots!!!!!'
297652,0,"This loafer was a good buy for the price. However, it was a little narrow & not as comfortable as I had anticipated. I was really looking for a ""slipper"" type comfort. Soft leather with a grip sole was what I thought I would receive. I did not find that comfort in this shoe but all in all it was a good price."
155332,1,"I have been wearing Justin boots for over 8 years now and they are by far the best boots I have ever owned. Every few years I get the idea that this other brand of boots that cost a little less will work just as good but after a couple weeks of wearing them I am back in my Justins again. I would recomend these boots for anyone that wants a boot that looks good, last a long time, and will be comfortable dad after dad."
209460,1,"I waterproofed this boot with some snowax, and use it for all sorts of weather conditions and I never have had a leak or wetness inside of any kind.The boot keeps me warm in as low as 30 deg weather, rain or shine. It's hard for me to get on, since my instep is pretty large compared to the boot opening.But that's ok.Durability seems quite good.... I don't see any signs of failure like I have seen in some reviews. They seem quite solid and on track to last for 10 years plus."
214051,0,Bought this boot for my daughter at Christimas. She loves the boot and style but it runs small.Very disappointed because I ordered a size 9 which is her true size and it's too tight. They don't come in half sizes and the size 10 will be too big.
66469,1,"And as you wonder, what exactly is this &quot;shizzysweet&quot; that she speaks of, I will enumerate the qualities of the Comptons and you will understand. The body of the compton is made with a killer fabric, the orange is my favourite though I own both colors, that is thick and would take serious wear to do any kind of noticeable damage to them. The soles, and soul, are pretty substantial. Knowing lots of people who dig writing slogans and other assorted B.S. around the sole, the substantial sole gives space for soul. They're also good for those of us who are shoe-lacingly challenged (or time challenged) and just put the shoes on with the laces tied behind the tongue. You can slide them on like this without your feet sloshing all around in shoe and you falling over in front of your co-workers, looking like a dumb---er, okay, I'm getting off on a tangent. Whether you're a Ben Sherman sycophant or you've never heard of this Sherman guy before you will love these shoes and understand the &quot;shizzysweet&quot; label slapped on them."
125286,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
249282,1,Love these Sketchers shoes. They look and feel great. I have big feet and they do a great job of camouflaging them. They run true to size and are very comfortable.
273010,1,"These were a great buy, I had tried several different shoes and these were the best fit. I have slightly wider feet and the curved top of shoe is better for my toes than any other. They may be expensive but are more likely to fit the best!"
139631,1,"These boots are both comfortable and provide good ankle support. Unlike some boots with toe protection, the toes are not cramped by the toe cap. Side zip allows the wearer to put the boots on quickly, while laces permit adjustment when needed. Good looking boot, and with pants-over can be worn to town. Very lightweight, but appears to be solid Converse quality"
17017,0,"I am sure they are great on real grass with the right size. One thing I noted is that they are bigger than what the guide says. I am a 10.5 regularly but they feel like a 11 or 11.5! In addition to that, I got the worse shin splints and hip pain playing on turf and sun backed grass! Unimaginable pain. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the playing surface.Conclusion: Get these one size smaller, and use them on firm natural grass fields."
44800,1,Was looking for a good shoe for Formal Wear. Found them at a local Mens Clothing store. Decided to go on line and shop around. The exact same Shoe but for 15% less and free shipping. Total overall savings was 25%.I am very pleased.
165982,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
183366,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
250445,1,"We live in the country where my daughter runs, climbs everywhere and gets into everything. I bought these sandals for last summer (2009) for my 6 year old daughter. It almost met all my standards for a good shoe; 1) Sturdy, 2) Easy to clean (ran them under the faucet and scrubbed them clean), 3) Able to run in them, 4) Easy to put on, 5) Still looks great! After having worn them a whole summer, my daughter will be able to hand these down to her sister! Now that's value. The only minor annoyance was that the toe part of the sandal wore by mid-summer last year, but you can't really tell since the color is the same throughout. Perhaps my daughter drags her feet?"
288236,0,"I purchased these shoes because they were highly rated on Consumers Reports. I needed comfortable shoes for walking many hours at work. They felt good for about two weeks. The cushioning just didn't seem to provide comfort over a long period of time. The cushion inserts are very thin, like most other shoes. I had to purchase good over-the-counter (OTC) cushion inserts to provide the cushioning and support I need.My podiatrist examined the shoes and said they were good, but lacked the correct cushioning and support for me. I also purchased some custom-made inserts, designed for my feet, and I'm still breaking them in gradually.I don't like the all leather tops and side. They get too hot in the summer heat. I purchased two other pairs of shoes (Nike Running Shoes)to rotate through my wearing cycle. The inserts in the Nike's aren't any better, so I just move my OTC or custom inserts to whichever shoes I plan to where that day and everything seems to work out great! Lasting comfort seems to come from a good quality cushion insert that does not come with the shoe.My recommendation for anyone needing a good pair of walking shoes, is to purchase a good quality shoe then spend more money on cushioning inserts OTC or custom made for your feet."
222377,1,"This shoe was purchased for my wife. We go to 4-21 days long trekking trips in Turkey (Lycian Way, Aladag, Kackar) as well as frequent non-technical high altitude mountaineering (Mt Ararat, Himalayas-Nepal treks). After sensitive search my wife has selected this shoe to fit her needs better than other models/makes for our non-winter trekking/Non-thech backpacking activities. Few of our friends have been using the same shoe for similar purpose in our Club and have recommended us. So far , product performs well, especially for harsh ground/scree condition. It is very lightweight and robust. Good value."
183089,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
36857,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
344575,1,"These boots replaced a pair that had finally worn out after over 10 years of frequent wear. I was expecting and dreading an uncomfortable break-in period. To my surprise and immense joy, these boots -- size 9.5D -- slipped on easily and fit comfortably from the very first wearing. NB: I wear them with insoles and they fit snugly but are not tight.The soles of the boots provide sufficient and safe grip/traction on slippery surfaces but still slide well enough for dancing. They also take and hold a shine extremely well.I've had several occasions to wear them in rainy weather and my feet stay completely dry even after wading through shallow puddles.I wasn't happy with the tags on the exterior. They are easily removed.All in all, these boots are a great value. I wear them almost every day and highly recommend them to anyone wanting a comfortable, dressier style of cowboy boot."
205108,1,"I bought these boots in 2007 and in the first week of wearing them I hiked over 50 miles in the Sonoran desert and I think I got 1 hotspot on a heel that first week. They are undoubtedly the best boot I've ever had. My feet are small, with a narrow heel and ankle, and high arch, and these boots are narrow and fit my feet perfectly. They also have a hard-shank sole which I need for my high arches, and my feet never get tired in these boots because of that. My pair are actually coming apart on the seems near the toes and they rubbed too much around the ankle, but I was told that is untypical of the shoe and REI is refunding my entire purchase. And I'm buying them again!"
346725,1,I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them. They were a very good price and I will probably buy more.
258153,0,"I bought the blue hippos for my year old son who was starting to walk all over the place. the slippers fit ok, and though a bit chunky they were light enough for him. the reason that i gave these only three stars it that the toes on these are easily worn and after the second time they looked beat up."
273096,1,Great shoes for bouldering. Have not tried them out on real rock yet but I am happy with them. Five Ten recently came out with some new shoes so I am thinking I will go for those next.
315571,1,"I was hesitant to order shoes for our son online, but he is a size 13 shoe, and this was the only place I could find with his shoe size and style. We were/are very happy with the shoes!!! He wore them over the Christmas break and liked them. He brought them back to college. Thank you!!"
208890,1,Great product. Fit very well. True to size. No break-in period needed due to soft leather and quality product.
106140,1,I love this pair.These shoes are fabulous! I had them all summer.They sexy and easy to walk and what a charm shoe!!!And I bet more summers to come.Very comfy.As always A+++++ for Donald J Pliner !Fantastic buy!!Great price on amazon.You could not find better deal.
282545,1,Not much to say. These are great! I love the hemp as they absorb moisture and don't get as sweaty on hot days. This is my second pair of the EXACT same shoes.
68605,1,"Very pleased w/ this shoe brush. It is sturdy, works well to remove mud, and is attractive because it's compact in size. Would highly recommend it!"
172166,0,"i found this pair very stiff and heavy compared to my one other pair of rockport. adding to my review,after wearing these shoes for 6 weeks and walking about 4 miles a day, both in these and a pair of mephisto shoes, i am very disappointed in this model of rockport. still stiff , didn't breathe, and gave me blisters.i would give these 2 stars at most. still like my other rockports though."
78562,1,Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
272075,2,"As the title has said, this product looks nice but it's not comfortable at all. I had feet pain and back pain from these shoes. They're in the trash now."
231163,1,I ordered a pair of Rainbow Sandals a week before Christmas for my son as a gift. I wasn't sure if they would arrive in time and I was so happy when the sandals arrived a couple of days before Christmas!
77430,1,"I must be one of the few people who didn't own crocs. I thought they were ugly and no ""plastic"" shoe could possibly be comfortable. Boy, was I wrong (at least about the comfort!). I was complaining because standing in the kitchen preparing dinner was taking a toll on my back. My husband suggested trying his crocs. Even 2 sizes too big, they worked great. So I ordered some in my favorite color. I am so glad I did. No more back problems. I wear them around the house instead of slippers because crocs have more support. They do have cuter styles, and I don't know if they all offer the same support, but I will stick with my bright purple crocs."
40505,1,"Los zapatos son de muy buena calidad. Me quedaron un poco grande, pero no hubo problemas. Me agradaron... me cobraron 116mil por el envio a venezuela :-s ..ya saben q traer zapatos no vale mucho la pena, pero en general los zapatos son bien bonitos...."
281697,1,"These shoes(2 pair) arrived quickly and were very attractive. When I tried them on, the fit was wonderfully comfortable. They look great and will be a good shoe to wear during the warm months. They are dressy enough for almost any occasion. They also look nice with carpis or crop pants. I highly recommend these shoes."
195460,1,I GOT THESE SHOES FOR X MASS 06 THEY LASTED FOR A GOOD 2 1/2 YEARS BEFORE THE OUTER SIDE STARTED TO RIP. I WAS ABLE TO PLAY ABOUT 2O GAMES IN THEM BEFORE THE SOLE STARTED TO RIP Oh AND I USED THEM FOR PRACTICE AS WELL.
183076,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
87675,2,I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality.
352533,0,"These are nice slippers, I like them, but they're not what I was expecting. The size runs a bit short and narrow--not a lot, but not true to size. The thickness of the shoe liner between the pile and the rubber sole is a little thin. Sometimes I actually feel a ridge of the waffle shape inside the rubber sole poking into the bottom of my foot through the lining of the moccasin. The synthetic pile makes my feet sweat and then they feel cold. Guess I should have bought the moccasins that are true, breathable sheepskin. The materials seem to be of good quality, and I like the leather ties. The ties are actually threaded through the collar of the shoe so that you can tighten or loosen the fit. Yes, I will buy again, but I will go with the soft-sole, sheepskin moccasin one size larger."
327670,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
386471,1,"I used to be a sneaker salesman, and this is one of the more comfortable causal sneakers out there. I had a few pairs that lasted many years before having to buy a new pair. Also tends to look better as it gets a little dirtier... if that makes any sense."
126943,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
150123,1,"THESE SHOES MAYBE DONT HELP MY SON JUMP HIGHER, BUT THEY ARE MADE REALLY WELL AND STURDIER THAN MOST"
38598,0,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
147855,1,Found them....loved them....ordering was easy....shipping was speedy. The boots are just as described and I wear them all the time. I love the 'bomber jacket' leather. Makes them just different enough from most other Uggs but you still get the amazing comfort and style that's becoming classic. No complaints here.
68655,1,"Going shopping to buy shoes for my 96 year old Mom is difficult to impossible. I was able to go online since I had the brand and shoe size. I compared prices on several sites and Amazon offered the best. The shoes arrived quickly and they were exactly what I wanted. Mom is wearing her new shoes and the entire transaction was soo.. easy for me. Thanks, SFSoftspots Women's Annie Hi Oxford"
214570,1,"I just moved to NYC, and after our first blizzard, I realized I needed snow boots. I browsed, read the reviews, and decided on these boots. This was one of the best decisions of my life! These boots are warm! I can step in any puddle, in any snow embankment, and even walk across an inch of ice. I highly recommend them!"
46679,1,This is a great boot at the sale price. It's really comfortable and easy to slip on and off. Looks great with jeans. Kinda UGG looking but way less expensive.
376228,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
367851,1,"These shoes fit well, are comfortable but do not last a real long time since like many other brands the knobs on the tread of the shoe are hollow and as they wear down a hole developes and when walking in snow or water puddles your feet get wet from water coming in through the sole of the shoe. But at this low price I just replace them when the soles get a little worn."
157373,1,The slippers were just what my husband needed. The price was very reasonable too. The service was flawless.
199435,1,"these are the best boat shoes so well made, even wet, non slip on deck or dock I have several pairs, and these have more support in sole and arch, good price too."
60743,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
137767,1,This style of Keds are cute enough to wear with summer dresses and maxi skirts. They provide more arch support than ballet flats and are good for lots of walking.
9461,1,"It's soft, and it lasts. I bought my over 2 yrs ago. My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that. Great value."
48812,1,These are fantastic! Great fit and wonderful to wear. I plan on buying more in all colors later. It is very hard to find shoes that fit me but these fit amazingly.
263250,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in a very long while, and they fit like a glove! I haven't owned a pair of converse in well over 3 years, and I'm so happy I decided to buy a new pair. Will definitely keep buying from all-star for a long time to come."
299321,1,"The best footgear ever invented! You can hike, walk effortlessly on sand, run, bike, you name it, and your feet will feel like they're being massaged gently the whole time! Looks-wise, they are not the sexiest shoe that will ever grace your feet, but if you're not expected to dress to the nines, these will fit the bill. I wore my crocs everyday to work this past summer and my feet have never been happier. You'd think with such constant wear and the grime and slime of summer heat the crocs would smell funkadelic, but oh no! They were stink-free, even though my bare feet rubbed and sweated all over them, everyday, for 3 months!Don't waste your precious wads of cash on $100+ sneaks when you can easily buy 3 pairs of these feet-friendly shoe sandals. Your dogs will never be tired again!"
79556,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
20633,1,"No question, this is the best, most comfortable sandal you will ever own. My first Reef Smoothy pair lasted 10 years! I just bought a new pair and absolutely them them.I prefer the regular Smoothy over the Contour Smoothy. The Contour is still a nice sandal, but the pre-built ""natural"" contour already in the sandal may or may not be right for your foot. I like them, but there is not as much opportunity to individualize the sandal to YOUR specific foot. The regular Smoothy is a full flat surface, almost like a blank canvas. After only a couple of days of wearing the sandal, it is already shaping to my foot. After about a week, it is perfect, specific to the contours of MY foot.Both Smoothy sandals are great. But if you have a choice, stick with the original."
5127,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
269460,0,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
74678,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
80738,1,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
134029,1,"The Melissa shoe gives a perfect look to any outfit. The texture and the unusual varieties of colors this product gives can make any outfit seem like the best. The way the shoes shapes the foot and brings out your natural texture as well as the shoes color is awesome. No wonder this product is so popular among all teenage girls today. Melissa's are a great shoe, it brings out the best in you and whatever you may wear."
105380,1,Love the color of these boots. They are exceptionally comfortable! They put some fun into your step....not to mention your wardrobe! Definitely a must-have!
380330,1,Great product. More comfortable than they used to be and they seem to be very well made. I recommend this product
213497,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
277274,1,"It took me awhile to get over the ugliness of them but once I put them on, I couldn't take them off! They are actually more comfortable than bare feet!!I think they look great with jeans. I know have 3 pairs!!! A must buy!"
129892,1,Great looking shoe that can be dressed up or down. True to size and great dancing shoes with the leather soles.
194108,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
263394,1,I wear a men's 12 normally. Per the other product reviews I ordered these a half size larger at 12.5. Even with the extra size they are very snug. After 3 days all day wear though they haven't caused any blisters and the inner support feels great. My only other gripe is not readily apparent in the product photos. The tongue on this shoe is very long and comes up to the front of the ankle. I don't think it would be comfortable with crew or no show socks. Worn with long socks it hasn't been a major issue. The shoes look great and appear to be well constructed. Time will tell how they hold up.
346486,1,Receiver??? You are denied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adidas plus talented corner back equals devistating defense and victory against any offense!! Adidas is Victory!!
142519,0,"Bought a pair with the same UPC from a sports chain locally, so I got the right size. Mine were made in Mexico. Will use them primarily to wash my cars and work in the backyard. I don't know how long the strap will last. But it is in place so far, so I shouldn't complain yet. The front holes are positioned odd. The ""index"" finger is sticking out and unprotected. Why not skip this one hole or use a different pattern? Besides that, the crocs feel comfortable. They don't seem to mark floors and decks, which was my requirement. I guess they will do."
278269,1,"I purchased these hiking boots for a month-long trip to China which was going to include a lot of hiking and not a lot of packing space. Aside from the initial try on when first receiving these boots in the mail I did not wear these boots in before setting off to China, with any other boots this might have been a poor choice. My first experience of these boots then was on a 15 mile hike on the Great Wall, up rough terrain and through some snow, and at the end of the day my feet felt fine. These shoes seem to have really great support without being constrictive. They are comfortable, durable, waterproof, and best of all for me, they are warm without causing my feet to sweat, even during rigorous activity.Another plus for me was these shoes odor fighting powers, despite being worn for 30 days straight, often without a fresh change of socks due to lack of laundry facilities, they wore very well. These shoes have been everywhere from strange nightclubs in Beijing to open-air markets in Tibet and continue to be sturdy and functional boots. I would recommend for anyone looking for a versatile and comfortable boot for your next adventure."
77308,0,Already own a pair purchased about 2 years ago. Sizing is much smaller now even though I ordered the exact same shoe. The bottom of the shoe reads the same as before but it's about 1/2 inch shorter. Caution to order a larger size now!
347258,1,Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable !! You can wear them all day and no problems.I bought them for my daughter and she loves them .
139580,1,This boot fits perfect and only took a couple of wears to work in. The C width is a secure proper fit for a narrow foot. Steel toe is comfortable. A great work boot.
9933,1,These boots fit my son and he really likes them This is the first time I was successful in purchasing footwear on line and actually having them fit. Hooray!
164051,0,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
362612,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
182860,1,First worry when buying shoes is their age as leather can by dry. This pair has soft leather. I would buy the same again.
356664,1,"These flip flops are very comfortable, like the look. Washes up great. The best part is the novelty of the beer opener."
266757,1,Great buy. Size fit perfectly. Normal wear and tear is almost unnoticeable. I gave them a four because in the beginning they cut at the back of my ankle but after a month or so of wearing them out they now fit like a glove. Came before delivery date. I highly recommend them. :) :) :) :) :)
298330,1,"I got these shoes for my son last year for Christmas because he asked for them. I wasn't sure he'd wear them very much, but he wore them so often he asked for another pair this year. They wore very well, but he's in them all the time and he wanted a new pair. He says they're the most comfortable shoe he's ever owned."
312771,1,"These shoes are very comfy. I bought them for about 20 dollars at a Dilliards in Colorado. I got a bright orange pair that caught my eye. When you first get them to put them on, they are not the most comfy things just yet. But once you break into them after about a month or so of everyday wear, they DO feel like you are walking on marshmallows. Even though if you have unproportionatly large feet like me, these do not help, but are a great purchase anyway. Yes they are extremely ugly but i actually feel bad for the people who do not have them and are making fun of them. In conclusion, JUST BUY THEM ALREADY!"
281986,1,"These are by far the best quality sandals- period. Why?1. Premium materials and construction. These are made to last forever2. Ergonomic. They mold to your feet to give you custom, correct support for your feet. So comfy3. Terrific look4. Guaranteed against breakage5. Made in USA, not some cheap, inferior import manufacturerSeriously, I am very discerning of quality and only buy the best. You will be very pleased with Rainbow sandals."
101806,1,Great shoe for little dancers. It is perfect for my 3 year old daughter's beginning ballet class. She loves them and does not complain about the fit. The plus is that they are so adorable and sweet-looking!
60492,1,They look good. They are very comfortable. I have wide feet and high arches the EEE was a good choice. Not made in America... but not made in China. Indonesia is not Indiana but better than China.
99797,1,It skips on easily and fits like a glove. Comfortable. You can wear it the beach or polish it up and wear it as a formal shoe.
244058,1,"The service was unbelievably easy, and the product was shipped sooo fast! Thank you! This was my first purchase but it won't be my last"
349585,1,"I have 4 pairs of these shoes and I love them to death! They are as close to indestructable as any shoe I've ever owned. Then you're probably asking why I have so many. Well, the answer is that this is the only shoe I know of that comes in so many colors (I've seen at least 7 or 8 colors) and works with just about everything in your wardrobe! Jeans, khakis, whatever- they work, and I love 'em!!!"
177836,0,The only thing I was dissapointed about was that there was some brown markings on the white sole. It wiped off no problem. But brand new shoes shouldnt have to be wiped off straight out the package. Other then that they are great!
371212,0,"I bought this shoe without having tried it on (which could have been a mistake) and was lucky enough to find my feet fit. Because there are no laces and the tightening system isn't that great, it would be advised to go down a size for a tighter fit. One of the shoes at the seam rubs on my ankle causing discomfort, however this could simply be my ankle and may not affect others rather than a problem with the shoe itself. The shoes are somewhat heavy (don't expect to be able to jump any higher) and the leather is quite soft and wears easily. I give these shoes 3.5/5, loosing points due to their weight and discomfort they cause me (again may only be in my case), however they look great."
333124,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
222874,1,"In the past I had purchased my favorite slippers at Nordstroms, then they discontinued them a few years ago. I had looked for replacements for them everywhere and finally found the Slippers International 400P and I am so happy to have them, they are almost identical (sole material is just slightly different) it's great to have them back. My son's are now ordering them as well. Love these!!"
136316,1,"Couldn't find this particular color/design combo in stores, so was very happy to find it here at a great price!Converse shoes run a bit big, so make sure you order a good half to one size smaller than you would wear"
207971,1,I love this bag. I can't tell you how many comments I have received while carrying this cute seatbelt bag. I like that I can hang my sun glasses on the side (through one of the seatbelt loops) when I'm in a restaurant or store. Way to go Harvey!
353689,1,I am very particular about my boots. It only took a day to brake them in and they are very very comfortable. I would recommend buying these boots. I also just ordered ananother pair.
212238,1,"Like all Easy Spirit Shoes, these are great. Order arrived a few days after placing the order. High quality shoes at a great price."
145417,0,"I bought these for my granddaughter who received another pair form someone else. There is a slight difference on the bottom of the boots, the inside fur, the way the tags are sewn on the back of heel and inside, the feel of the outside suade, and also the seams. I have heard about fakes so I am checking it out carefully. They both look good but the differences made us stop and think about who is selling fake ones. It's a crime to do so...but I will report it if I find out they are fake.Any tips are more than welcomed."
73848,1,"Love this product! Confortable, waterproof and cute! The only negative is that the black button that hold the straps came off. Hope they have replacements!"
241542,1,"What can I say?I love this shoe,there awesome.They made me feel like I was walking on air everytime,I really want another pair of this great shoes.I love them so much,I might just buy 2 pairs lol."
376864,1,"My son loves these boots! He doesn't even take them off in the car (miracle!) I love them too because they are sooo easy to put on, very comfy (obviously:)) and cute too!"
203572,1,"Great style. feel good and fit well. Quality leather, good stiching, quality heal and sole with smooth finish. Will buy again in future."
237728,1,These were given to the boyfriend for his birthday... He's got big wide paddle feet and works in a hospital (such as me) but he works about a hundred more hours a week than me. He's been wearing them to work and LOVES the arch support...and they look ADORABLE with his scrubs.
62432,1,I need to change shoe size from 6N to 6M. You have no place to make a change. Other than that I like the on line ordering.George
98365,1,"None of the stores seem to have BLUE! Only black, which is similar to this brand. The sponge soaks in the ink, and I paint it on my shoes. Goes on quick and my shoes look like new. Love it!"
258390,1,My son thought these was so nice with the cartoon character on them.
85185,1,"I wear them around town, for comfort. I find them very comfortable, very easy to get on and off. I don't wear them enough to comment on odor issues.When they get wet, they do take some time to dry, but there's not much to get wet anyway."
351775,1,I purchase the Asics GT 2160 in Late October. The service and shipping at Amazon was quick and easy. The price was great and I didn't have to deal with the teenage mall shoe store salesperson...
186342,1,"These clogs are perfect. As an artist, student, Gardner, and a worker, this shoe is great for standing all day long without a lot of fatigue at the end of the day. It's as if they were made perfectly for my Sasquatchian feet! Plenty of room for my toes and plenty wide.They look cute, they are unique, and they wipe off with a swipe of a rag....no fuss! I bought the Birkenstock cork liner, which seemed uncomfortable at first, but broke in quite easily and conformed to my foot. The liners/insoles clean up easily as well and have maintained their good looks for over a year now."
284058,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
338464,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
40975,1,I love flip flop---what caused me stress fracture twice!!!!!!!My podiatrist recommend on reef!!!!!!The arch is perfect and mine is very high!!!!!!LOVE!!!!!!!!! LOVE!!!!!!! LOVE!!!!!!!!!
150661,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
109154,1,"I love the look of these shoes. They were a bit uncomfortable at first and caused a few blisters, but now that they are broken in they are comfortable."
219886,1,"Was very thankful these arrived so soon after ordering,was a last minute item...and my daughter loves them....she now has 2 pairs..and is planning on collecting them for different colors....Thank youShelia Sale/VA"
35679,1,very comfortable and easy to put on. my doctor recommend this type of sneakers because of their support system.
311578,1,"I've only owned one pair of Clarks prior, and after this experience, I'm convinced they are one of the best shoe manufacturers out there. They are soft, light-weight, and use good leather. Very comfortable, definitely would recommend them to others."
211053,1,"I bought these because everyone was raving about them and now so am I. These are my go to heels. I wear them all the time. They are so cute. They are very versatile and are perfect for work, dates, and nights out. The heel is the perfect height, tall enough to make a difference but short enough so you don't get super sore wearing them. They are the most comfortable stilettos I've ever owned but don't expect it to feel like slippers, they are heels and still hurt my feet every now and then. The black patent is hot and gives a little edge to any look. Nine west shoes run a tad big so either get your size or a half size down."
179757,1,Thank you for sending this fast and correct! These are my daughter's favorite shoes and when her old pair finally got holes in the soles she put these on her Birthday list. She unwrapped them and immediately they were on her feet!
371154,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
16571,1,"OK, So everyone knows Brikenstock shoes are good for your feet, especially sore tired at the end of the day achy feet. But when you have foot problems like I do - you really need to have several pairs around. For the rest of you - these shoes are great to put on after you kick your work shoes off. So much better than going bare foot!!I like these becuase they look dressy and sharp and not so hippy-ish like most of their sandals do.Even thought they are closed around the toes - they are still airy.I love Birks. I bought a pair for me and my daughter. A word of advice though. Try them on in a store first. Some Birk shoe lines - like these from their original line - have a high toe bar - the ridge under your toes on the inside sole. They may be too uncomfortable at first for some. After experience using these - you learn they help your toes grip the shoe as you walk.I only gave a 4 becuase I keep wishing Birkenstock would offer more shoes with their cushion over the cork foot bed. Those are so wonderful. But honestly I have no problem with the hardnes of these becuase it cups your foot and feels good.I think they look smart enough to wear a lot of places. Since I do not wear heels - these were a good shoe at a great price !!!"
78006,1,"used this shoe for 13 hours in the office, going up and down the 2 flights of stairs from one department to another. So comfy."
259464,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
128604,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
316314,1,These shoes have been my favorite purchase in a long time. I bought the red ones because red is my favorite color. the only bad thing about them was the fact that when i took my foot out of them the dye had rubbed off on my feet. a Cherry popsicle was not an exciting thing for me to have as a foot.
77937,0,"I love the look and design of this shoe. It's so stylishly retro, the ultimate sneaker. However, that's where the love ends.I've used Superfeet arch supports for years because I have very low arches and knee problems as a result. I don't typically care what kind of insoles shoes have when I'm shopping for new shoes, because I know I'll just pull them out and insert my Superfeet. However, to my dismay, the insoles in these shoes do not come out!! What shoe manufacturer makes shoes with non-removable insoles?!! Apparently Adidas. For me this is a deal-breaker, and I've returned them. Despite what I've read, these insoles have very little arch support."
318967,1,"I'm a big man with a wide feet, plus I work and walk on my feet for 8 hours a day. This shoe is perfect for someone who has to dress professional and plus it has style. I'm a Atlantic City casino worker and I have been buying this shoe for years, this is like my 20th pair. It's has enough comfort and cushion you don't need insoles. The wide width fits perfect to my fit everytime. The good thing about it is, it gives you a casual and professional look. I can wear them on my days off with a pair of slacks and shirt or at work with a business suit. This is the first time I bought them from Amazon. For only one reason, the price. I use to buy them them shoebuy.com but something told me to check here and they were a little cheaper. I guess if I have free shipping like shoebuy than I would have felt a big savings, but a few bucks was just as good. BIG MEN, WIDE FEET MEN, CASINO WORKERS...THIS SHOE IS FOR YOU. \O/"
174802,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
159602,1,"I have worn chucks for several years now and have always been pleased with the shoe, but this was my first purchase from the seller and I am very pleased with the service and quick shipment of the order..."
96455,1,I bought these for my son because his old shoes were falling apart. He really loves these. He said they were really comfortable and almost effortless walking. I dicided to get a pair for myself and I love them!
34058,2,"Be aware that this shoe--in a WIDE- is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide. The shoe runs narrow. However,it does come in an Extra Wide. Although the shoe has little to no arch support,it is, nevertheless a ""dressy"" alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet."
347989,0,"I got these shoes hoping to wear them to work, wanting to replace a pair of Rockport topsiders that are starting to wear out. The sole on these isn't really great for standing for 8 hours at a time, so now I just wear them for going out."
79720,0,The sole did not have as much support as most reefs. Cute but had to go back because I need the support.
31562,1,"I don't have too much carpet to vacumn, so this is perfect for me. I tried several other kinds but I don't like the heavy weight monster vacumn at all. There is only one master bedroom upstairs, and living room down stair come with Carpet, so ez to carry it every where. I am suprised how it work, it could clean my kitchen, stairs, and even wood floor very well. The only thing I worried about is the battery life, it takes hours to recharge, but last for about an hours or so. Good enought for me though."
154700,1,"I put shoes to the test, I am on my feet and moving for 12 hour shifts.I will buy these shoes again because they are shaped like my feet. I don't have those little slivers of feet that everyone else seems to have. If you were to take my shoes off and look at my feet, they would look more like a duck's foot than any standard shoe off the shelf.All the stuff people say about padded this and shock absorbing that, doesn't mean a darn thing if your foot is too wide for the shoe. My toes scream: ""Give me freedom to move or give me nakedness!""(I have very outspoken toes)."
155944,1,Good shoes. A little tight sure they will loosen up as I wear them. Overall I am happy with purchase
102122,1,"The fit is GREAT. The quality could be better, but at that price you can buy a new pair every month."
181347,1,"For fashion sneakers, Skechers continues to impress. These shoes look great and are very comfortable as well."
309588,1,I really like the Easy Spirit shoe products... this shoe Jumper is wonderful... the only one that I like better and is just about like it (but made better is the Easy Spirit Threshold - available only at JC Penney that I can figure out). The design and support are terrific!
339214,1,"The product is excellent, just send me the color is not requested, although in the case said White, the content was dirty unbleached white"
342263,1,I like these shoes. The only drawback is I constantly feel like I need to tie them tighter because they feel like they loosen easily. Good shoes though.
149400,1,"I bought these to wear when I want to step outside for a minute or make a run to the market, but they look good enough to wear with an outfit as well.I've had these for a little longer than a month and they are still comfortable and look good.They don't let your feet get too sweaty like some sandals and are snug enough not to flip and flop.I left them out in the sun for a a good amount of time and the footpad/clearpart got misshaped, but I think it's back to normal now after breaking them in again."
266221,1,I am from New Zealand and buying this shoe all the way from USA was an extreme decision. I got this shoe in June 2011. I have been using it for the last few months and the following points are worth mentioning.1. Great balance and fit. though initially a bit tight and takes a bit of wearing for proper fit which is quite natural for leather.2. wear at the back heel at minimum which is a common problem for me and in some cases shoes may almost wear out in a month. (I walk to my work and return with is about daily 5kms)3. They are really waterproof! Not a even any moistness inside! Just wonderful4. Elegant and good looking!5. Worth the money spend including the $25 shipping! Will buy again the same brand and product!
279647,1,"Timberland 50061 Newbuck Chukka is the same as this black chukka. This is THE most comfortable and lightweight all around no BS boot I've ever worn. There's no Thinsulate but it is very water ""Proof"" I'm sure you don't want to walk into a pool with them but again, they are great boots Make sure you get the 50061 they have a lighter sole than the other Timberland boots less ""Beefy"" I use them for work and for the gym as well. Just all around the best boots I've ever worn. For Deep snow I would say get an 8' at least boot but for hiking, gym, work from CA to NY the 50061 is great. The new buck gets dirty fast so get 2 pair. One for beating on and one for going out ""styling"" if you will. Again, very light weight, true to size can't beat em for under $100.00. Great for landscaping, hunting, you name it. If you need severe cold weather you may try something with an Insulate if not these are the best boots ever made. The Black model is a different # but exactly the same just in Black Leather."
62099,1,I bought these for my son. He had a pair he used for work (construction) and he wanted another pair that looked a bit nicer. He loves these and says they are very comfortable.
345882,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
165458,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for casual wear with my jeans when I did not want to wear my regular walking shoes. They are cute, stylish and comfortable for everyday wear, not recommended for heavy walking."
363175,1,"Came fast, look great, a great experience. The fit is amazing, the color is vibrant, and to know that it's a (red) product is awesome. Will defiantly recommend and buy from again."
120122,1,I wear them almost every day. They are comfortable for standing and walking for long periods of time. The only part is the strap across the top of my foot sometimes slides down and I have to fix it.
154680,0,These boots are high quality and we really like the fact they are made in the USA. My husband says they are a bit tight.
388232,1,"TROOP Footwear is back for the 2k3 and they are hot. These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
23545,1,My husband says that these are the most comfortable sandals he's ever worn. And the bottle opener is a cool little add-on.
292293,1,"I absolutely love these boots! Like all bearpaw boots they are very comfortable and toasty warm. I have owned just about every brand of boots you can imagine...many many pairs of cute winter boots and these are among my top 3 favorite! My other two favorite pairs of boots are bear traps and another pair of bearpaw boots. I have owned UGGS, and to be honest...they really are a waste of money. Bearpaw is just as good, they last just as long and for a fraction of the price. If you order a pair and there is something wrong with them.....just exchange them for another.....after all, manufactured items contain flaws on occasion!"
366216,0,I chose this product last year to use when fishing in the tropics in Australia as it it is open pattern and water proof. the shoes are very comfortable and were working well until I walk through some heavy mud. The end result is that the glue that binds the sole gave and I now have had to throw them out. I will get another pair but I will not wear them in mud as they are a bit expensive to throw away.
116853,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
262220,1,"This is my go-to walking shoe when sneakers just won't do. Just returned from walking at Belmont Lake State Park where I wore this Jocelyn shoe. Since I've purchased it, I've put it through its paces--from muddy trails in Maine to sidewalk rambles here on Long Island, and it has held up. Comfortable for sure. The material never seems to scuff, and simple clear gel polish keeps it shining. The heel hasn't shown any wear either. This is the second pair I've owned, and they last quite a long time. The only consession I've had to make was buying a cushioned insole product to ""beef up"" the cushioning which eventuals gets thin. It's true to size, but the extra wide width I bought had just enough toe room, not a lot of extra. I'd buy it again."
127099,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
319943,1,"I really like these! They are super comfortable and move nicely. However, sizing information is super confusing. The size chart is confusing so I looked to reviews for help. They were even more confusing. I ended up buying my street shoe size, and they are just a little too big. I probably could've gotten away with a 5 1/2 (I wear a 6). But other than that they are great!"
137879,1,Mi hermano qued&oacute; encantado con su regalo. Como siempre de excelente calidad y acabado. Son bellisimas
204630,1,"i love these flip flops. they're so much more comfortable than my rainbows. i only wish i had discovered them sooner. they're soft on my feet, yet i can still wear them a decent distance (as far as flip flops go)."
297911,1,"I love these shoes. I have them in black and I have had lots of compliments (from men and women) about them. I tend to wear them with patterned black knee highs in winter. They are very comfortable, although they take a little getting used to due to they are a little heavier than most of my other shoes. I would definitely recommend them."
146136,1,"WE received the Ugg boots before Christmas, since the boots were a Christmas present for my daughter, I was very please with the quick response. My daughter loved the boots and wears them every chance she gets. She says they are very warm and set a fashion statement with her friends. Thanks AMAZON.COM for the great service!!!!!"
272369,1,"True to size and comfortable fit. Seems to be durable, would recommend to others."
359506,1,"Just an impressive product. Comfortable, easy to wear, pick the right color and they kind of go with anything. I am just a comfort guy when it comes to shoes and clothes. I put these on at home, when i go out to the store, whatever. They fit right based on the description they give, delivery was right on time and the price was right. No complaints!"
273400,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
168636,1,These are so lovely and comfortable iam going to buy me another pair of these.
256816,2,"Doesn't fit the way I want it to. Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused, I cannot return them."
296342,1,"This isn't a review but just a message on the off chance that anyone representing Corcoran reads it.I live in the UK and it is virtually impossible to get these boots online in Europe. The ones I've finally managed to find cost an absolute fortune (185) which I'm still going to pay as I may not get another chance to buy any -since these ones will no doubt quickly sell out.There must be a huge potential market in the UK and Europe just from armed forces personel alone, such is the reputation of Corcoran over here. So for what it's worth, please for the love of god try and make Corcoran boots available on Amazon to the European market -I beg you!Regards, Liam."
280944,0,"While the price and width availability was attractive, these shoes are not for the serious walker. They offer little in support and left me with sore feet and a serious blister on my right heel, even after several days' worth of comfortable wear. If you want a cute, inexpensive shoe for casual wear, they're a good value for the price. If you're looking for a walking/exercise shoe, invest the money in something else."
213039,1,"MRS BOWLES WAS ""VERY PLEASED "" WITH THE PRODUCT, THE SPEED OF DEV., AND THE ACCURACY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS.WE FELT LIKE WE ""WERE FAVORITE CUSTOMERS""...."
262856,1,Bought item for my bro...so all i can say is delivery was on time...Thank You!
161505,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
81501,1,"On a recent visit, my daughter had lamented about the trouble that she was having finding Chuck Taylor Converse shoes in royal blue. She claimed that she and my father in law had been trying unsuccessfully for sometime to find the shoes. With my recent successes purchasing things on Amazon, I went in, found the shoes, ordered them, and before we were done with the conversation had them on their way.They arrived within the week, and she is happy, which makes me happy."
219093,1,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat.I received 2 pairs of nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat White.when requesting the colour on the order form, you have 2 options for wheat. The option for Wheat White is not separate from regular wheat.I am now stuck with 2 pairs of the wrong colour. I live in Ireland and therefore would be very expensive for me to send them back to you.I am very dissapointed with my purchases. Unless you can rectify the situation for me I will not be recommending your service to family and friends.Thanking youRachel Costello"
244888,1,very comfortable boots that breathe very well. I used mink oil to weather treat them and it darkened them up a little more than i would have liked. Other weather treatment methods may be preferable. no complaints they are the most comfortable pair of work boots I have maybe ever had.
48359,0,"I thought I would try some Havianas because I have been seeing them all over the internet. When I was a kid we always used to have what we called ""zoris"" for most of the summer and part of the rest of the year. Growing up in California, these were the obligatory shoes for kids. And cheap. Havianas aren't cheap, but I thought I would try a pair to see if they were sturdier than discount store thong flip flops. The one problem with thong flip flops is they wear out. And a lot of the ones you can purchase at discount stores are made of very cheap materials, not rubber, like they used to do back in the day. These appear to be made of rubber, and it seems like they will last longer than the discount ones. That being said, they probably won't last all that much longer, and they also have very high straps for some weird reason. You can tell this from the photo. I don't have skinny feet; my feet are somewhat akin to a ducks and are thick, but these were very loose and when wearing a thong sandal, you don't want loose straps. I purchased another pair in another color and they were the same so I am assuming this is true for all Havianas. Big box retailers, some of who sell here on Amazon I was happy to find, are now making thongs in more rubber-like materials and I bought some really sturdy retro ones the other day for $2.50. So this was the last pair of Havianas I will be purchasing, regardless of the cute patterns and colors they have. Save your money and just buy another pair of the color you like best at the big box store or here on Amazon so when the first ones wear out, you still have the same color. I could buy 4 pairs and have the same thong for a lot longer than these Havianas will last me, that's for sure."
277386,0,"I purchased a pair of altitude iv boots from amazon a week ago. I had a chance to wear and test them yesterday. I was very unsatisfied with the way that they preformed. The ""cleat like"" sole made it impossible to walk up a slightly inclined damp board. If I was able to return these shoes I would without hesitation, but instead I am stuck with a pair of boots that I feel are useless bordering on unsafe. These boots are one dimensional; they seem to work well if you only walk on soft earth or dirt. If you plan to wear these in to town... don't buy. They seem to be affordable, but found them cheaper at my local outdoor store.**Update**While I stand behind what I said above... These boots did turn out to be very comfortable. The footbed provides good arch support. They are very much a hiking/ snow clearing boot. Great if you don't intend to wear them to work. The rubber on a work boot like (timberland pro) is very different and allows the wearer to walk up a wet inclined board while these are better suited for a muddy inclined path."
5586,1,I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
321226,1,"I absolutely loved these shoes in the pic, and I'd bought them to go with a bridesmaid's dress. The color matched perfectly, but of course, a three-inch heel is not exactly meant to be worn for 8 hours of walking, pictures, and dancing! The shoe is a little narrower than most, and I would say it runs about a half size small overall. They look absolutely smashing, but make sure you've got an alternative (preferrably a flat, soft one) for those long party nights!"
171637,0,"I received my first pair but I found the shoe to be too big. It's about 1/2 size too large but it seemed to be good quality. I sent back the first pair and ordered the smaller pair. However, it did not seem as good as the first. The removable padding was lifting out of the shoes. They are comfortable but not the quality I was expecting. If I were not leaving my home state I would have returned them. They are comfortable and Bargain Outfitters reimbursed me for my first pair and included the shipping which was awesome. So basically, the shoes are not what I would really like but the company was very good and they shipped out quickly."
322966,0,"The shape is good ,but the color and it's arrangement doesn't match."
373286,1,i like this produce very well. i use it when i ride my bike. the only problem is that i need to wear a sweat band under it because it can get very wet and the money inside can get wet also.
167449,1,This is my sixth pair of Traveltime shoes. The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I am especially happy when I can get a good price on them.
280779,1,This is the third pair of Clarks Desert Trek Boot I purchased. Love this boot. Comfortable and rugged. I say buy and pair and be as pleased as I have been.
365539,2,"the shipping time was great, but they sent me low tops instead of high tops. they said if i send them back they'll send me the right ones but i shouldn't have to, they should've got it right the first time."
164731,1,I have a difficult time finding shoes that will work for me. Most stores do not carry fashionable women's shoes in wide widths. I am enjoying this pair of Easy Spirit Shoes in the color red. I would purchase these again without hesitation.
145477,1,"Aside from being super comfy, these UGGS have a subtle tropical print pattern and the color is unique. Very happy with this purchase!"
215405,2,"I will never buy anything from this company again. I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law's wedding, they were not what she wanted, we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge. Boy they are reaaly making money off customers."
285139,0,"This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price. But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B. A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available. Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days. I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present."
241964,1,I had no idea how these would work out for me. Turns out I love the way they look and they got here super fast. I am incredibly satisfied.
125718,1,"just in time and just what i needed. This are just like the first reebok shoes i got as a little kid. Light, confortable. They also fit just perfect. Strongly recomend this product."
389029,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
230447,1,"I purchased these boots to replace a pair of burlys that were quite old; they had cracked along the top of the foot near the ankle. My husband uses them to slosh through the hilly woods on particularly soggy days as well as for wading in streams. I am told they are completely waterproof, quite comfy, have awesome traction and the fit is mostly true to size. They maybe run a fraction big, so to be a perfect fit when wearing thick socks. He's very happy with these boots. My father has been wearing LaCrosse boots for as long as I can remember and these latest boots continue in the tradition. I didn't give them a 5 for a purely girlie minor detail. I think some people might roll their eyes now, but here goes, they smell bad. Despite the advertising that they are scent free, it took a couple weeks of airing out to get rid of the rubber boot smell. It doesn't matter so much for us, but if you are planning to use them for hunting I would recommend buying them early so that they have time to lose that smell. Otherwise they are perfect!"
259023,1,"Because I live in the city, I do not have time or transportation to get items such as these. It was so convenient and I saved a little $$$!"
288117,0,"I wish I didnt buy these, if you wear them barefoot they really hurt the soles of your feet. Quite simply the Speedo sandals I bought at Costco a few years ago are FAR more comfortable. If you plan on putting on thick socks whenever you wear these, then they may work better for you."
99790,1,"I have been wearing Birk clogs off and on for 20+ years. I always seem to come back to them. They take a tiny bit of time to break in, but then they are perfectly formed to your foot. I then proceed to wear the same pair for years. If you have a shoe repair place near you, they can resole and recondition your birks pretty darn easily.One hint from years of wearing these is make sure you keep the cork beds in the back of the shoe coated with a sealant. There are products out there for this. Just reseal the cork like twice a year or something."
186159,1,"Awesome shoes that I've bought several times over the years. I love the nondescript style and the (somewhat) retro look. Low key, nothing flashy but very cool.They're getting harder to find. Here's hoping Reebok keeps making these."
97720,0,"Grew up wearing Clarks desert boots, but that was two lifetimes ago. These are lower cut and easy to collapse and roll on your ankle. I even tried adding an additional eyelet but they just aren't working out. I'd love to get half price for them."
338174,1,Outstanding shoes! Just like I remembered from high school years ago. I was glad to see them make a comeback and the price is great too.
329709,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."

25881,1,"This really is the best shoe I have found for training on pavement. It is very cushioned, and I notice less leg pain than with the various kinds I was trying before these. It wears like iron - I get probably 50% more life than from a pair than from other trainers I have used. Part of that is due to the fact that the uppers are still made with real animal hides, not synthetic. I put 600 miles on my last pair and visually it looked almost brand new.Oh, the best part: they're one of the few shoes still made in the USA by American workers."
340087,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."

All my teammates had miserable blisters and shinsplints on the walk, all except myself and one another teammate. We were wearing the Asic 2070. Although made for running, the Asic 2070 is comfortable, durable and light weight, all the important features in a shoe for a serious walker."

84111,0,"I ordered these shoes because I had a previous pair of Dockers shoesthat were very similar and very comfortable, but I could no longerfind in the stores.

324923,1,"It's worth the money to buy a quality product like this. Less expensive moccasins/slippers don't fit as well, don't feel as good, don't look as nice, and don't last as long. Finally, after a long search, my husband is happy and his feet keep warm in the winter."
182657,2,"I didn't notice it when looking at the online pictures, but these boots were the ugliest things I've ever put on my feet, and I am no high-end shoe wearer. Honestly, they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid. Thankfully, I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on, I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer. Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge."
16958,1,"let me preface by saying that my previous shoes were $350 (I pre-ordered and received them the day they came out) bright orange, F50 prime, that weighed 5 oz each. COOL! is what everybody thought about those rocket boots. I still love them even though they are all stretched and worn out after about a year of daily use. I also have my older F50 adizero chameleons (now cleaned up and for display) and those were more than double the price of the copa as well. Now, I still prefer the orange primes over my new copas when it is wet and muddy, because they are plastic they can be hosed off easily and forgotten about until needed again. I knew I needed to move away from F50s when they came out with the micoach computerized model. because I dislike micoach and it's generally very-buggy software. (a former micoach pacer addict, here).NOT HOT...You need to take care of them. I tried the shower trick when they were new and treat them often about once a week at least with leatherfood from eurosport. Traction is slightly less. They do not run as fast. (if you haven't worn out several pairs of top line F50s then you will probably just say ""lame excuse, you just can't run as fast as you want to""... my 100m PR is 11s even and I can do a 5k in 16:50) They just don't feel as fast as the TOTL synthetics; in football speed isn't everything.So the copa traction is not as good, the speed is not as good. They are more than double the weight. So... what makes these shoes worthy of a 5 star review???SMOKING HOT...here the magic of the copa comes in. Whatever hesitation I would have, that extra touch I always felt I needed before letting off a shot or pass, it's gone. I am finally at the point where I can start learning juggling tricks. I've been playing since I was 4 and up through HS of course, but about a year ago I really stepped up my game. I worked hard to get where I am, and I'm not letting shoes take the credit for that. but I do think they help.Some day, adidas (and nike and friends) will figure out how to make a plastic shoe with better touch than K-leather. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to have your boot custom made exactly to your foot as precision-measured by a robot. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to print your own designs on your boots in any colour of the rainbow. but that day has not yet come. Everybody in the world will be able to afford a pair, and they will last forever. unless you want a new pair, and then the old boots will instantly turn into delicious cookies and beer. but that day has not yet come. Until that day comes I don't see anything better than copas, for me.If you look in the dictionary under football cleat you will see a picture of adidas copa. I'm no superstar; I pay to play, I don't get paid to play. I'm like everybody who just wants to have fun on the field and if you are the same, you should at least consider your next shoes a pair of copas too.That being said, if you've been wearing copas for the last four hundred years, and would never, ever, consider anything else, go out and try on the latest obscenely-expensive, all-synthetic, high-fashion boot. You may just be pleasantly surprised. At least enjoy modern technology once in a while. I will be buying another pair of F50s before long. I am simply addicted to the speed and the colours.P.S. Messi wears F50s, sure. but he wears very special leather F50s, not plastic ones. If I want to be like messi I will wear his shirt of which I have several. Not his latest adidas boot..."

11096,1,"I am very pleased with these shoes! They arrived quickly and look great. Thanks to everyone who mentioned these shoes run a 1/2 size smaller. I normally wear an 8 1/2, but took a chance and ordered these in an 8 and they fit perfectly. Very cute shoes, will probably order in other colors!"
274480,0,These were my first pair of boots. Bought them for motorcycle safety training (needed footwear that covered the ankles) & been using them sparingly over the last year. The shoes are a nice dark shade of black but the lace rings are a little too shiny for my liking. Price could be cheaper too. No other complaints.

110286,1,"I got the shoes right before my trip to Europe. I had been in pain on my knees and ankles that made it painful to walk. I was so afraid that I would not be able to enjoy the trip because of all these problems. I searched the web to try to find a good pair of shoes to help me but did not really expect much. I read the reviews about this shoes and decided to give it a try. To my happy surprise, I was able to do all activities during the trip including long hiking and climbing hills. At a time, I tried to change to different shoes but all problems came back that I change back to this shoes immediately. Now I can't wear any shoes without pain except this one. I am thinking about buying more."
373742,1,These shoes are replacements for dome I have had for a long time...not worn them yet nut expect same quality as before.
306164,0,"these shoes aren't the best but, for $30, they're ok. they're good to beat up, get dirty, and abuse. the soles, especially in the front part, are thinner then ideal but for this price one can't be too picky or demanding. if you're looking for high performance running shoes pass on these but if you want low cost, decent, running shoes buy 'em."
282401,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
37419,2,"Dumbest. Shoe. Ever. The SQUEAKING ruins them. Not only is it LOUD, it gets LOUDER with wear. You will sound like an IDIOT when you wear these shoes. Inside, you can hear them at least 15 yards away. Outside, unless a bus is passing by, you still hear them when you walk. Plus, the QUALITY IS BAD. The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months. The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe, causing severe discomfort. Mainly, THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT. Who's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school? YOU. Who's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym? YOU. Who's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas? YOU. I bought these so I could do martial arts, but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting (thank goodness I'm not trying to be a Ninja!), and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes. OH, and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe, rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable?"

153457,2,I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow. Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly. Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide. I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes. I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
327614,1,These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected.
212348,0,These are awesome on my running shoes and cross trainers. They work best on icy surfaces. I also tried them in my snow boots though and they don't work and they are not very helpful in thick snow.

305412,1,"I would have given 5 but I have been buyer these for a long time and I feel the quality is falling just a bit. If a manufacturer in the US would make something as comfortable and as nice looking, I love this style I would buy them as I really hate the fact they are made in China."
124864,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
147226,1,Firstable I have to say that the service was perfect!!! They were perfectly in time and I really like them. They are warm and confortable. You must buy a smaller size. I usually wear 8/5-9 and I bought 8. Thank you Amazon!! and Happy Holidays to everybody!
383485,1,"I love this shoe. It's dressy, but casual enough for every day summer wear, and it's comfortable for walking around every day. I bought one years ago at a retail store, then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and couldn't find anything else that came close. I found these here, and ordered the same ones I had before, and am very happy about it. Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6!"
325865,0,"These shoes were uncomfortable, not nearly as comfortable as the comparable shoe in birkenstock. The footbed is not quite the same."
50841,0,The style and fit are fantastic but........ my pair has an odor from day 1 that I just can't get rid of. I even get busted by my team members. I really do like these shoes though and would hope they all don't have the problem I am still experiencing. PS I'm sure I could have sent them back for a different pair.
305548,1,This was the seventh or eighth purchase of this make and model shoes so obvioulsy I am very satisfied with them.
99869,1,"I bought these heels for a wedding I was going to. Not sure if these are really wedding shoes, but whatever. I love wearing flats and it's really hard for me to walk in heels but these were actually not that bad, I managed to walk around in these on different occasions and not twist my ankle or look really awkward. These are super cute and basic so they work for a multitude of occasions."
112870,1,"The backpack arrived as scheduled. It looked like I expected and worked as expected. No surprises -- a good thing. The handle is short, but perfect for my elementary-age daughter. It is easy for her to maneuver, roll, pickup, etc. Everything works. We are pleased that the product matched our expectations."
339011,1,They are the shoe of shoes. I own multiple pair in different colors. They are great shoes and will last you... Be carful they can rub your skin raw if you don't properly tighten them.i could wear these shoes for days.
106759,1,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
283335,1,"I purchased black Life-Stride Malibu sandals during the summer. They are comfortable and I love to wear them all the time. They look nice with shorts, jeans or dresses. The temperature is often warm here so I wear them often."
332803,0,"I bought a pair of these and got a pair for Christmas. I truly loved them, despite their clunkiness. They are really comforatble and durable. However, I started noticing that my feet were getting really rough. The same was happening to my boyfriend, who was also wearing them all the time. It took us a while to figure out the connection. We were slathering on the lotion and using a foot file every night. Suddenly we put it together. Once we stopped wearing the crocs, our feet got soft again. If you wear socks, it prevents the problem, but it looks pretty dorky. I hope they find a way to fix this problem, because I would love to buy more. But until they do I have to give them up if I ever expect a foot rub from my boyfriend, or the evil eye from the pedicurist."
383769,0,I bought these shoes for myself. They look nice but there is no arch support and they just don't fit all that well. They are sitting in my closet and will probably end up at the local Goodwill.
112381,1,"I have these DARLING Betsey's in both the black and the dark blue print; the fit is very good for my small size five foot. The shoes feel a bit stiff,( I'm not sure if that will change with wear, since they are made of fabric, not leather) and are EXTREMELY HEAVY for contemporary shoes, which is why I gave them a rating of only four of five stars."
376306,2,I never received this item. It was sent to the wrong address and the company wasn't very helpful in helping us. We asked for a refund and got that.
341559,1,"Very comfortable and good arch support. These are roomy shoes so they are great for adding orthotics for even more customized fit. I often wear a 9, but with these an 8 1/2 is just right. This is my second pair."
11763,1,"I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart. They were so very comfortable, and worked well with different types of outfits, including shorts and capris. The only problem, (which other people have mentioned), is that they do tend to run narrow, so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe, I think that they are a great value.Addendum: I now have three pairs of these shoes, in different colors. Except for the times that I need to wear sneakers, I find that I am wearing a pair of the sandals, to the exclusion of all my other shoes.Update: I now have four pairs of these shoes. No matter what I am wearing, I seem to always go back to one of these ""Mimosas""."

195832,0,"Very sexy shoe. I bought this shoe for a wedding that I was in. The shoe matched perfectly. I was concerned that the shoe was a bit too risque for the wedding, but it actually turned out to be a perfect complement. The shoe arrived very quickly and the price was just right. The shoe was easy to walk-in at first, but I must admit that after about 4 hours my foot was a bit uncomfortable, but the first time that I ever put the shoe on was that day and I spent some time walking around and dancing, so it's to be expected to some degree- That's the reason for the 3 stars."
145685,1,I have to say these are one of my favorite brands ever. in fact i now own 12 pairs of ugg boots they really are comfortable whether you wear them as slippers or for everyday. but i have to warn you because of the flat sole they are not that great for walking long distances unless you put in an insole. i have to say my favorite ones i own are the classic tall lavender the classic tall patchwork and the sunset in teal. definitely worth the money because they last long my oldest pair is over 5 years old and going strong.
124650,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
178230,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
94172,1,I bought these shoes for my mum. She has wide feet and has a hard time finding shoes that fit. This pair just made the grade.
274525,1,"I wear these for my everyday general use. I'm usually pretty rough on shoes and found these last me a good long time. Very comfortable, even out of the box. I bought my first pair of these about 3 years ago, and had to get another when they started wearing out. More than likely will buy another pair in 3 years if they're still available."
308295,1,Arrived in 2 days.Still the same wonderful shoes I remember from high school 25 years ago.
296751,0,Good-looking shoes but not to trek in. What you see on the outside is the only layer - you step into a thin layer of suede that will not stand up to elements. The bottom is rubbery and sort of gluey and the inside is thin.
204372,1,"I just received my new Danner boots a couple of days ago. They feel great. No break in period was needed. These boots are true to size. I have worn these in the snow for 8 hours and my feet were warm and dry. They only have 200 grams of Thinsalate but that seems to be pleanty for my climate zone. They do seem a little stiff, but that was to be expected with double leather on the boot uppers. This boot is made in the USA and are recraftable. I had my last pair of Danners for 25 years. They are still in good shap, my foot just got too big for the boot. The quality of my new Danners seems just as good as my last pair."

7573,1,"Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price .Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price .Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I don't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots .After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good .Even though they are black, they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs .They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them ."
287132,1,i wear a wide shoe and have a hard time finding one that's comfortable under $100. i was skeptical about buying the rockport prowalker. well i've been wearing the shoe for a month now and am very pleased with the way they feel. imagine a shoe that feels this good under $50.00. i will definitely buy this shoe again.
122043,1,it pleases to me to say to them that all I leave myself satisfied very
238944,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
127603,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
255461,1,"Over the last 15 years or so, I've owned probably 5 or 6 pairs of these, some in white, some in black, and one in blue. I keep coming back to them periodically because they are just a well-balanced, awesome shoe! The price is always reasonable on them (usually around $30). They look good - I'd even say they are timeless in this respect. When I buy a brand new pair, I always feel an extra spring in my step, as they feel nice and nimble. Also, as a bonus, you can throw them in the washing machine! I can't say that about my beloved Adidas and Puma hi-tops. Anyway, if you're looking for a truly classic pair of sneakers, I can definitely recommend these."
14527,1,I was surprised to find out how light these moccasins felt. They are so soft and comfortable! You hardly realize you are wearing them. These are a nice shoe to wear on the hot days of summer. Highly recommend them.

73444,1,"If you wear a 7.5 size shoe, order the S/M or W6-7. I ordered a W8-9 and they were way too big, returned them with no problem and got the right size."
13067,1,I was surprised to find out how light these moccasins felt. They are so soft and comfortable! You hardly realize you are wearing them. These are a nice shoe to wear on the hot days of summer. Highly recommend them.
114213,1,"These ballet slippers are perfect. However, I don't know if they have possibly changed the sizing because I read the other reviews and followed their suggestion to order a half-size larger. And of course, they are too big now. Not terribly so, but enough that I wish I would have ordered my daughter's regular size. Oh, well. Four-year-olds grow fast, so I'm sure she'll grow into these by the time the dance recital comes around!I did measure her feet with a tape measure and compared it to the sizing chart provided. She measured right at an 11, so I ordered an 11.5. I definitely recommend measuring with a tape measure and ordering true to size."
123372,1,"perfect pair of 45"" flat neon yellow shoelaces for my chuck low tops. I love them, they're worth every penny."
317325,1,When I bought my first pair they were very comfortable and the fit was just about perfect. Didn't have to add any cushion at all. 2nd pair the same way. I would rank these 4.5 stars if I could. The tip of the toe on the 2nd pair came loose but that was because I wore them for as long as I could and it was finally time to get a new pair. These are the best I've found for me.
154828,1,"The quality of these shoes are nice and I think that they will last a while. There was some confusion about which size to order and I wish that I would have just followed the sizing guide provided. In regular shoes my daughter wears about a 10.5 and I ordered her a 12 for these ballet shoes, which is too big. I did measure her feet though and they are about 6.25 inches. Have I had followed the sizing guide I would have gotten her an 11 which would have fit perfectly. No biggie though. The elastic bow tie, that is pictured, is not just for looks it actually tightens the shoe around the foot."
145389,1,"I finally decided to buy these boots after seeing how popular they are. They are very comfortable and durable. Much better than all those imitation boots, the quality is far superior. These are definitely worth the 195$ if you can afford it."
144596,1,Uggs are always so comfy. My feet are always so happy in Uggs. The blue is great with jeans. The best
1176,1,"took these boots backpacking this past weekend and they performed above expectation. waterproofing stood up to mud and stream crossings. After looking at more expensive brands I am more than happy I bought the Hi-Tec Altitude. After 18 miles these boots were still comfortable with no blisters on my feet. Affordable, lightweight,rugged,waterproof comfortable and stylish. If you overlook these you are missing out on a superb value."
151153,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
15342,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
383047,1,Awesome pair of shoes. Absolutely love them. Its not available now but will buy again if it becomes available here.
336920,1,"I originally bought these to finish off my Tenth Doctor costume, but they're actually really nice shoes. I wear them often and they are quite comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the colored band on the sole has started to come up on one of them... It isn't glued to the shoe very well. But for what I paid for them, I'm willing to let that slide."
324014,1,"I bought these shoe trees for my size 13 M shoes and they are nice cedar trees for the money; however, they are a touch small (short). They fit in the shoes, but don't fit tightly as shoes trees really should to maintain shoe shape, especially in the toe box area. If you are a 13M, I would consider ordering the next larger size (if there is one)."
32780,1,This is my first pair of Allen Edmonds and I am very happy with my purchase from Amazon. A $78.00 purchase for a high end pair of shoes is unbeleivable. They fit great and are very comfortable considering I never wear loafers but decided to take the jump. Mostly wear oxfords but decided to wear loafers with tan khakis ann looks great. Great buy and will shop for brown pair now for same price.
325900,1,I have wore them on several occasions and they were comfortable from the very first day. They are lined and the cushioned sole is very comfortable. I would buy another pair for a similar price
253922,0,"I recently received my taupe colored shoes and they were nice and comfy. The shoes have a nice shine to them and the stitching is well done. However, even though you can get a clear picture of what you're buying the shoe is odd in shape. I had to put on some boot cut pants to tone down the length of the shoe. I had someone scream out that it resembled and elf's shoe. Great buy just find some pants that you can sport them nicely with."
90637,0,i got a pair for less than 3O but not completely satisfied. the style looks like it is for men >50 yr olds. The size fit bigger than regular. you should buy 1/2 size less than your true size
17593,1,I have always been. Big Vans fan. I never owned the classics but after buying them I love them. Really comfortable and are made much better than other company's shoes that are made to look like vans.
289950,1,"I bought a pair of these almost 2 years ago, and they're still just about the only shoes I wear. They're (obviously) durable, and extremely comfortable right out of the box. Sizing chart seems pretty accurate- I wear a US 12, and the 46 fits perfectly. I've worn them all over the US, but like most SUV's sold here, they spend 90% of their time in civilized environs. Worn most often trudging around the streets of NY, which has probably been their greatest test of waterproofness. Only one shortcoming for urban wearers: wet traction. Smooth, wet surfaces can leave you looking like Bambi on ice. Will not hesitate to buy another pair."
313121,1,"This cost me about $60 less than buying it at a local store. Good quality, good fit. I'd buy it again."
29716,1,I gave this to my wife whom went to The Ohio State and was very happy to receive the Ohio State Crocs. They were received in a timely manner and was well represented.
194912,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
97190,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
316584,1,"This is the third pair of these sneakers that I have owned, I love them. I play a lot of racquetball and these sneakers give me the support I like and can stand up to the test. I would recommend these sneakers."
145413,1,"These boots were purchased to replace a pair I bought four years ago (which I wore on the regular until holes in the soles forced me to throw them away). New, they are just as soft and warm as I remember. The boots seem to fit slightly differently than my originals. I had/have a 10 in both. The new boots seem to fit a bit bigger than the originals. Even so, I am happy and eventually I'll stop tripping over that extra centimeter of boot."
269829,1,Good price and great service. It's always good to be taken care of. I'll be back. Will recomend to one and all.
176237,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
244953,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
90292,1,I bought these for my adult daughter and she absolutely loved them. They were my favorite Christmas present that I have anyone and they got just the reaction I wanted from her.
82179,1,my son likes them very much although i would have preferred them to have a more flexible sole. Anyway i'm satisfied with the purchase.
142228,1,"I really spent some on-line time searching for a good running/workout shoe. These are perfect. I put them on and went for a run, no break in was necessary! I'm going to need another pair in a few months."
389339,1,"Converse All-Stars are the all-American shoe, and the black monochrome goes with everything. Seriously; I've worn these to the opera."
185120,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
330256,1,I recently switched from a being a regular Bostonian customer. The Rockport is as comfortable as the old Bostonians that I used to buy.
260344,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
256847,1,"I walk five miles every night and absolutely love these shoes. They are very comfortable, good arches, my feet never feel tired or sore after walking,"
162281,1,"I have been wanting these shoes for some time now but when I would go to buy them, they didnt carry my size. People would just tell me that chucks didnt come in half sizes and would want me to by a size that didnt fit me. I knew better went online and got them cheaper and with free shipping. I love the internet"
80327,1,Now that my daughter has received the correct size the sneakers are perfect. I had no bad experience with this vendor. Keep up the good work.
51283,1,"I have always had trouble finding a shoe that fits. I have a wide toe box, a narrow heel and I pronate. My podiatrist recommended these running shoes and I'm loving them. I have a stable gait without feeling my knees are going to give out. I feel confident with my running ability again. They are true to size, supportive and have a nice style/color."
249127,0,"These shoes look so elegant and have that ""red-carpet"" look. However, this pair hurt your feel very badly. I just tried them on for second, and i had to get out of them, because my feet cannt take them any longer. So i had to return them to the seller. Somehow, I realize that Chinese Laundry shoes have very good design but they are uncomfortable to wear. So i recommend not buy this product. save money for your better purchase !!!"
285356,1,Top of the line work boot for the man that wants comfort with a fair price
101404,0,"These are cute shoes to wear with some nice work slacks, but they are not very comfortable. There is not much softness to the inside of the shoe and they are pretty rigid to walk in. The front of the shoe does not go far back so unless you have very long pants when you walk your socks will show, so wear nice matching trouser socks with these. I like them okay, but I can't wear them all day without my dogs barking!"
76804,1,"I use these shoes for tapping, but they are so attractive without the taps, I could have used them as street shoes. Based on what another buyer said, I bought them larger than my normal size and they are wonderfully comfortable. Love them!"
327856,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
306199,1,"Very comfortable. Also do not scuff easily. Overall, a great value."
325762,0,Usually you have to order dr martens a size smaller than it is listed UK 12 = US 13 but in this case they sent me the US size instead of the UK size. Everyone else I've ever gotten dr martens from always goes by the UK size. Just be careful if you order from The Sportsman's Guide that you order the US size and not the UK size. Vendors need to be consistent about which size they list. Now my shoes are 1 size too small.
274565,1,Been wearing Etnies for years but for some reason they have lost some of their quality and comfort recently. Decided to give these eS's a try. Worn them a few times already and I am more than impressed. I generally live in skate shoes when not at work and these have been impressive. I wear either a 14 or 15 depending on the style and manufacturer and these fit great and are extremely comfortable.
86451,1,"As a daily runner and marathoner, I was in the market for a new pair of running shoes. I considered the Nike Shox, but after a few tries with them I decided to go the alternate route and picked up these new Adidas.Wow.The UltraRide blows away the Shox in terms of support, comfort, and stability. The ""cool"" factor is also very high with these shoes.Recommended over Shox"
363410,1,"Greetings, the purchase was made as effective as I have in my hands the product without any sort of trouble. Completely safe.Saludos, la compra fue efectuada de efectiva, ya tengo en mis manos el producto, sin ningun tipo de inconvenientes. Completamente seguro."
368555,1,"Excellent...very soft sole as usual..happy w/the color choice..stands out..I really prefer Havaianas Top flip-flops over any of their styles that they offer because of the butter soft sole, it's much thicker...another happy purchase & my flippies arrived very promptly....these flip-flops are SUPREME..:)"
181312,1,"Sperry stopped making this shoe in 2003 yet it is still available through Amazon. Someone is hoarding these shoes. I have worn them for decades and am sorry to see them fade from the market. Sperry, are you listening?"
357874,1,fast delivery and brand new! in box and should order in 1/2 size bigger im a 7 so 7 1/2 fit just great
383646,1,"I love this shoe. It's dressy, but casual enough for every day summer wear, and it's comfortable for walking around every day. I bought one years ago at a retail store, then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and couldn't find anything else that came close. I found these here, and ordered the same ones I had before, and am very happy about it. Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6!"
122614,1,"Sooooo comfy. I brought a pair of these for work as I am a vet nurse and am on my feet all day, but I find I wear them every chance I can (I've since purchased a second pair and have put them away). I also use them to go for my morning walk and get a lot of compliments on them. I recommend these to anyone."
233190,1,This is a wonderful soft comfortable shoe that's perfect for every day wear but can take you into the evening as well. I bought two of the same in different colors. Highly recommend.
301975,1,"I have the almost exact same pair in black and just love them! The leather is very soft, the heel is 2.25"", which is a nice height for work and play, and the toe is pointy but comfortable.I found these same exact boots on another shoe website for $90, so the price here can't be beat!"
15771,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
76472,0,"ordered these for my wife, pretty much what you'd expect for the price. Not bad for fun club wear, but not for every day unless you want to reorder monthly. Sizes do run small, which was a bummer as the shoes were a birthday present that she couldn't wear."
238742,0,"I have regular/slim feet but always have a tight toe-box on heels and shoes. I was hoping this would stretch the toe box area. Unfortunately this was made to stretch not only the toe, but the front half of the shoe including the sides. I didn't want the sides wide, just more room in the front. Just didn't work for what I needed. Also, I'm an 8 1/2 and think the size down would've been better."
294461,1,i am very pleased with my purchase! i purchased these boots for my sons birthday they arrived sooner than expected in great condition! i had standard shipping and they arrived two days after i placed my order which was great so that i could complete my sons wardrobe for his birthday party! they were in good condition and authenic timberland quality!!! i would highly reccomend this seller to someone else!
256483,0,"Couldn't find this color anywhere else, thankfully they had it. It was cheaper than the stores too, only bad thing is that the sizes are general so &#34;medium&#34; was big on me and i wear a women's 8."
349742,1,"The are the most comfortable and durable flip flops I've ever owned. This was my second pair -- the others are still going, just wanted a back up to alternate."
350635,1,"I now have 2 pairs of these Ugg Tasman slippers, which I wear everywhere. They are comfortable, warm and do not slip on the icy sidewalks. I just jump in them and go, no socks! They run pretty much true to size and look great. I am very pleased with my Ugg Slippers."
20290,1,"Service was exellent, my shoes are great I recommend this shoes to any one, the BEST SHOES for thoes who work 12 hour day"
49554,1,has anyone else bought them? i want to know if they would fit well over my muscular calves? i don't have thin legs. before making this purchase i would really like to know about the fitting. i hate returning items. thanks in advance!
335077,0,"After reading the reviews I decided to give these tennis shoes a try. They are not very comfortable to me. They are made for people with narrow feet. I had to leave the strings loose until the shoe stretched/broke-in. Even after they broke in they are still too tight for a Tennis Shoe. As far as support, they do help and when on your feet for long periods you do not feel the fatigue as with other brands. If they were wide enough I would rate them higher."
167071,1,"Wow, my first review. Naturally, I would review the T-Macs first, but I just love the Reebok Amaze classics. I got the baby blue and white. If you cool ghetto and urban, defintely it's a pick up. Comfortable, stylish, good ankle support, and lasts for a long time. I just keep buying more of it."
95064,1,"I wear 7.5 wide in New Balance. I ordered the 7.5 wide in these, but they are too big. When I wear out these shoes, I'll buy the size 7. For now, I guess I have to wear thick socks. Otherwise, they seem pretty comfy."
4676,1,"These are so cute, but they seem to run very big. I purchased these for my daughter in the smallest size (2-3) and they are still huge. I wish they had a smaller size as I really wanted these for my daughter to wear in the winter. I am going to keep them in hopes that she will grow into them. They are so darn cute and soft!!!!"
128754,1,"Very cute with jeans, comfortable at first, did a lot of walking my first time wearing them and by the end of the day my feet were killing me..I still love them though."
296189,0,"I have a sloped concrete driveway that gets very slippery in the winter. The Yaktrax totally elimanted the slipping problem while removing snow. I wore them 3-4 times for a total of about 3-4 hours. Then one of the rubber straps with the spring gripper ripped lose on each Yaktrax while I was wearing them for the 4th time. I had them over hiking shoes, so that may have contributed to the failure. The Yaktrax are very light and would be good to have for an emergency. But for frequent use, I would be concerned about durability."
218127,1,Great purchase! Great service! Great delivery! my boyfriend was very happy with his present. Thank you for making it so easy
159420,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
36117,1,Tremendo zapato Clarks entrega rapida buen precio comodo y de buen material se recomienda el producto saludos desde Venezuela .......
87068,0,"The shoe is nice overall; it just didn't look good or feel good on my foot. Although I was disappointed, I would NOT discourage anyone from purchasing that shoe."
28996,1,"I'm standing on my feet for over 9 hours a day in these shoes, and I've got to say, they wear as good today as the very first time I wore them probably a couple of years ago. They are so comfortable that the only time I don't wear them is when I have to dress up!They are great with my uniform, great with jeans. Just about anywhere I have to go, they can take me! I think I had to replace the shoestrings, but other than that, they still look great, and feel better than barefoot. They have perfect support for my feet (and having had a heelspur, that's VERY important!) I'd have to say they are the best wearing pair of shoes I've ever owned, and considering what I've paid in the past for a pair of ""comfortable"" shoes, I could get 3 pairs of these for less and come out WAAAYY ahead.....lol."
111825,1,"I had plantar fasciitis last year, and had to get serious about shoe support. I also have narrow feet, and, as a result, many brands don't fit correctly. Naot Kayla sandals feel great and look cute. Thanks, Naot!"
274573,1,"I was looking for a pair of high-top shoes for walking when I found a review of Hi-Tec's Altitude IV Hiking Boot. They sounded what I had been looking for, so I purchased a pair.I have been pleased with the fit and comfort of the boots, and the short break-in period. I thought at first that the soles might be a little too aggressive for my needs, but they have worked out fine. The jury is still out on the durability, since I have only worn them for about a month, but I am very happy with the purchase. I like the looks of the boots as well."
357567,0,"I'm normally a size 8, but the shoe was small especially around the toes. I returned it and am waiting to receive a size 8.5. However, the shoe was very sturdy, nice, and good quality."
220920,1,"I received so many compliments on these shoes!! The only thing that I don't like is the fact that is really hard to tied them up to my leg. For some reason the string becomes really loose as you start walking.Other than that is perfect, I just have to tie it really hard"
386225,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
92962,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
157378,2,"I tried on these slippers on precisely one time, then returned them to the box. They weren't horrible, just not real comfortable, and I got the feeling they wouldn't be particularly warm. But to be fair, I didn't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency. I just didn't like the feel of them.For my money, better to pay a little more and get better quality."
277574,0,"These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
167488,1,I have a very hard time finding narrow comfortable shoes and these are great! I have three pair in different colors.
382869,1,We bought these shoes for my mother-in-law. Her feet were swelling some and her other tennis shoes hurt her feet. We wanted to buy something a little wider & that seemed more flexible. She now wears them when she goes on her morning walk & other times during the day...she really loves them!
177606,1,"Cute, comfortable, and cheap! I love these shoes so much I bought two pairs (different colors of course) and I still want more!"
270496,1,"I owned a pair of these years ago, loved them and decided to get another pair. These are good fit but a little stiff. I'm hoping that will go away once I break them in and scuff them up a bit so they don't look so neon white.Overall, a great pair of shoes for walking."
225186,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
205060,0,"I wanted to love these boots. They fit my narrow, low volume/high arch/instep really well. But after a couple hours of hiking, the edge of the tongue, which creates a firm ridge, starts to bruise my leg just above my ankle bone. Maybe it isn't soft and padded enough. I have very narrow ankles/legs and tie the upper portion of the boot snugly so it won't slip and maybe it pushes the tongue into my leg too much. I tried lacing them with the tongue on the outside but it wouldn't stay that way very well and wasn't real comfortable. It felt sorta like having shin splints by the end of the day. I'm so bummed cuz I think these could have finally been the ones!"
126241,1,"I've never owned this brand before. But, I liked what I saw in the picture... They simply looked comfortable. And I was right. Their light weight, style and color was just what I was looking for.From my experience with these great shoes, I would buy this brand again."
358051,1,"I have been using these shoes for salsa and tango dancing since last year and a half. They fit perfectly well and have been a great companion for my twice a week dancing nights.They have nails struck into the heels and they can be very slippery on a smooth floor. Dancing shoes are meant to have less friction, but nails do not serve that purpose. Also the sole is not very strong, so if you dance for a long time, your feet might ache. But they are the cheapest shoes I have ever bought and hence I cannot complain much.If you are just beginning to dance, these might be the best choice, once you know your steps you can graduate to better ones."
322708,1,"The shoe fits perfectly, works wonderfully, and is of good quality. The only problem I had with these shoes is that the material around the top of them is scratchy and hurts if I don't wear tights/socks. I'm not sure if most ballet shoes are like that at first, but all in all they're my favorite shoes that I own."
11009,0,"I purchased these as replacements for Allen Edmonds Eastport Boat Shoes that I purchased 3+ years ago. The previous pair were great shoes and I would give them a 5 star rating. The only reason I tossed them was the stitching came loose around the side of one toe. AE does not re-condition these shoes.The coloring of the leather and laces is different from the previous set, not bad just different. The sole is exactly the same as the original (and that was very long lasting). The stitching appears different,.. just a tad thinner than the previous version,..and they are made in the Dominican Republic now. They are just as comfortable as the ""originals"",..so based on sole and comfort (+) and thinner stitching and no longer made in USA (-), I give them three stars,..if they wear as well as the previous and last as long,.. I will up the rating...worn for casual wear at office and out in town once to twice a week,.... occasionally while actual boating."
226919,1,"Purchased for my daughter. She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size. I would order 1/2 size smaller."
121427,1,Exactly what I wanted and $20 cheaper than the store. My boy rocks and so does his shoes!! Only wish they were available at that price in my size........uhg!!!
8724,1,"I ran my first marathon ever yesterday (Grandma's Marathon, Duluth,MN)and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands. I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles. After reading Runners World review of the latests, I ordered this pair from Amazon.com. It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it. The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned. The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends' advice, I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet, I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister. I highly recommend this product. Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon!"
134612,1,I bought a pair of these in 1999 as work shoes; at the time I worked at a dress shop and was a teaching student. They were wonderful for commuting on the bus and student teaching. But it's been 13 years now and the shoes have seen better days. The inside is completely ruined and they have a slightly funky smell (as 13 yr old shoes often will) but they're still the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I keep meaning to buy a new pair but never seem to get around to it. I love these shoes. Every few years I get the urge to toss them out (they're old and dirty and ripped up inside) but the moment I try them on again I remember why I haven't before. They are SOOOO comfy!!!Favorite pair of shoes EVER!
251277,1,"Owned a pair of these sandals previously but a bad little puppy chewed one of them up. The replacements are as good as my original pair. Extremely comfortable, excellent quality, fit just right and can be worn all day without tiring the feet. There is a break in period but after that a pleasure to wear."
303984,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
124999,1,"I have been wearing boots for over five decades, since I was a small child. I have worn NONE better than the ones Browning makes (or has made for them). This is, with out reservation, the most comfortable boot I have ever worn. I favor the sole for good traction and added confidence. The boot is higher (10"") than most I have recently worn, but that too adds to the feel I like.One negative comment: The boots are a little hard to pull on or take off because Browning has changed to smaller eyelets than I remember on earlier models and they are plastic, not metal from years passed. This causes the laces to be a little hard to pull tight or loosen.Would a but again? Yes Siree!!"
344086,1,The shoes were in excellent quality and the size and the color were correct. Very good product. I am very happy with my purchase.
327444,0,"Light-up shoes are not my first choice, but these look decent. Nothing about the design is particularly out of character with any boy's shoe, even older kids. I would rate them four or five stars, except that one month after wearing the shoes three to four times a week, the lights have ""gone out"" one of the shoes."
32968,1,"I'm a 185 pound neutral runner, averaging about 20-40 miles per week in preparation for a marathon. For my flat feet and normal volume feet, these shoes are perfect for me. I've tried Nikes and they are generally too narrow. Price is right if you can find them on sale - $70 vs $120 new."
44257,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
202326,1,Practically a work of shoe art. Solid construction. Exceptionally comfortable. Made in America... love that!! I predict these boots will last a very long time and will become an all time favorite!!
154595,1,"I never thought I would find something like this especially in time for Christmas, thank you so much- they are awesome looking and the recipient will absolutely LOVE them as a Christmas Gift. I will be a returning customer for life."
294778,1,"Order a 1/2 size up. This is the perfect boot for an average to narrow foot. Solid, thick leather upper -- slender attractive profile. Thick enough sole to protect the upper from rubbing the ground, even when they stretch from breaking in. Too pretty to come from America -- but it does! Far more substantial then the cheap junk you get from China, and not as fragile as the soft, exotic, but impractical shoes I've gotten from Italy. I've looked very hard and can only find a handful of footwear manufacturers left in the USA -- most of them make a shoe like Redwings or 'nurse's shoes,' and indeed the other styles FootThrills makes are very 'nurse-like.'I love these boots, and will be buying the brown too -- and a pair for a friend. Totally competitive price for a quality boot, all things being equal -- why not buy Made in USA? [Sorry, it's my thing!]"
40737,1,"I love these flip flops, they are so comfortable and have a built in arch support. They are well build and are currently molding to my feet. I love Reef flip flops."
238462,1,Very stylish and sexy for an inexpensive shoe. The comfort level is ok however adding pads makes them feel much better.
260273,1,I ordered these and when I got them they were everything I thought they would be. I love em!
72302,1,Shoes are true to size. Will be getting them in black too! Shoes are comfortable and look / feel well made.
115237,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
141184,1,"this is the most comfortable running shoe ever. you feel like you are running on air. Also, they look great. :)"
322140,1,The shoes seem to be a good quality. They have nice coloring & very supple. I would recommend these shoes for anyone needing ballet shoes.
256380,1,"I really love crocs, they are super wonderful. They last a long time, my old ones lasted about four years. I wear them in water and they are washable. They worked very will for me. I would recommmend them to anyone and everyone. A other thing I like about the croc brand is that they new thing like boots! But mostle that they come in LOADS of colors. Like I said ""I would recommend these shoes to anyone and everyone!""."
82582,0,"Very good quality boat shoe. Superior to comparable brands.Nevertheless, the shoe's (M) could be misleading.As user of Timberland's brand, among others, Dockers is definitely Narrow."
7224,1,The 'leather' doesn't seems to be of the same quality as they have been since purchasing these for several years.Also the fit is different but still satisfied with the sneaker.
332954,1,"They arrived fast, are comfortable, and look good (which is what matters in high school!)."
118732,1,"This was perfect for the 3 year old's first ballet class. She looked like a perfect little ballerina. Only problem, as with most shoes with ties for kids that age is that come undone easily."
206884,0,"I received my first pair but I found the shoe to be too big. It's about 1/2 size too large but it seemed to be good quality. I sent back the first pair and ordered the smaller pair. However, it did not seem as good as the first. The removable padding was lifting out of the shoes. They are comfortable but not the quality I was expecting. If I were not leaving my home state I would have returned them. They are comfortable and Bargain Outfitters reimbursed me for my first pair and included the shipping which was awesome. So basically, the shoes are not what I would really like but the company was very good and they shipped out quickly."
329471,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
111056,0,"I have had these for a few weeks now. When I first started wearing them the soles were too hard. There really isn't any cushion in the boot, other than the thin insole. The outer sole of the boot seems to be a much harder rubber than I am used to. I believe this combination is what was causing me some discomfort in my knees. I bought a pair of third party cushioned insoles and that seems to have taken care of the problem. I have worn Nike boots for many years, but saw these online and decided to give them a try. Maybe I am just too used to Nike. Other than the cushioning issue, the rest of the boot seems decently made."
41314,1,This is a really great sandal. I have bought them in the past and have found them to be very comfortable. Not like regular flip flops. The narrow strap makes them very fashionable along with the many colors they come in. After wearing them for awhile they seem to mold to your foot shape. What I like most about them is they have a built in arch which is great for people like me who have a low arch or are flatfooted. Also the price at Amazon.com is a great buy compared to what I have payed for them in the past at other places.
214612,0,"These boots are well made, attractive and warm. They are very heavy, though. The weight is noticeable even for short distances. Also, if you are a 1/2 size, they only come in full sizes. Go down a 1/2 size. I went up and once I wore them a bit and they broke in, they are loose now."
128594,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
79741,0,"My husband has some reef sandals and I've worn them on occasion and found them to be comfortable. I ordered a pair when I started swimming. These are of good quality, but they are not half as comfortable as those my husband owns. The strap on these is strangely placed, further than I'd like from the toe portion, leaving a lot of foam around your toes (is this for toe stubbing protection?), and it is not comfortable for me at all. As I wear these a total of twenty minutes per wear it is fine. Husband has now informed me (he's a flip flop lover, I never wear them) that I have to try many on before I find my perfect fit. So, if you have narrow/medium feet and longish toes, you might have just found your slipper, Cinderella. If you, like me, have wide feet, average toes, and wear a 9.5, these might not work for you."
386534,1,I believe running shoes is all they do. These are comfy and retro-cool.
161471,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
281245,1,MY FIRST PAIR OF CLARKS. THIS PAIR OF SHOES HAS NOW BECOME MY FAVORITES. LOOK GOOD WITH ANY KIND OF PANTS. I WILL BE A FAN FOR LIFE....
56204,1,"They are just right for my flat narrow feet, i will be wearing these shoes all summer-- they go with evrything.Elaine"
285765,1,"I have found athletic/walking shoes to be cheap and without support. Today, shoes are marketed as being lightweight which in my book does not make a good shoe. Eastland shoes provide the support that my feet need."
354268,0,"This boots are warm and comfortable, but they are much shorter than 10"".It is misleading to advertise them as 10"" when they are in fact 8""."
369308,1,"I got these sneakers for my husband after months of searching in stores. New Balance must not make them too much anymore. Anyway, our entire family owned a pair at one point and we must say it is by far the most comfortable, lightweight sneakers we have ever worn. Considering the price and comfort it is an excellent deal."
251999,0,"I sent these shoes back because they were too small.I could have got 1/2 size larger. But, I wasn't sure 1/2 size would work. Probably would have. I recently broke my ankle.It's a nice looking shoe. I'm an old timer and like the retro look. Not into outer space shoes of today.The padding wasn't that good. I've had a lot of shoes with better padding."
143806,0,It is so good to me. and size is also perfect. but one is error. good has scratch in logo 'N'
380545,0,"It's a very good product (Capezio), high quality but the heel is too high for students that are doing character dancing for the first time; beginners should start with a 3/4"" heel... ...unfortunatelly, I just learned that!"
224756,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
241623,1,I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job. This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements. Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants. (make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable.
129755,1,"Finally found a shoe brand on line that is well constructed, excellent quality, and fits my narrow foot, plus being on sale. Will be back for more. And the shipping was fast also!"
197936,1,"I bought these shoes a few years ago for walking around, but didn't wear them much because of how uncomfortable they are for long walks and/or running.However, I've found that these shoes make excellent and inexpensive shoes for weight lifting, especially during squats, as well as for heavy bag work when boxing. These shoes have very little cushioning other than the hard rubber soles, but this gives you an excellent and stable plant so that your can perform squats with much better traction and balance than in heavily cushioned running shoes.The material of the outsole, the bottom of the shoe, is such that it gives you traction when you need it, can be easily avoided when you don't. My feet are squarely planted for squats, lunges, and heavy lifting - they don't slide. They plant well, and I get good form.However, when I'm doing heavy bag work, they are extremely easy to pivot in and let me easily pivot my feet and hips to delivery quick and strong punches and round house kicks to heavy bags - a much better feeling than even going barefoot, unless I were to use a lot of talcum powder on my feet."
97637,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
246637,1,"Good pair of shoes, reached in time and nice to wear them. Excellent dress shoes. Get just a bit warm in summers for hotter regions."
368164,0,They fit but I do not like the feel of the flip flop :( Ive been wanting to try these for years and feel let down
46932,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
130656,1,First things first...I AM NEW TO BALLROOM DANCING.The shoe seemed a bit expensive and I am glad I bought it a little large because the shoe is very snug fitting. I have no idea if should be that way or not but it is. Keep that in mind before you order. If you have wide feet you might want to look for a wide size if available. The shoe is nice and light and allows for controlled sliding across the dance floor.
373808,1,quite comfortable and light on the feet. actually warm without the socks. nice snuck fit. This is a good shoe.
41677,1,"This shoe has no ""break in"" period. This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have every worn straight from the box. I hope they hold up, seems to."
200019,1,"These are just awesome, lightweight and flexible with great support. Very comfortable, Nice looking too!"
323759,1,These shoes are very comfortable right out of the box. I love how they look great with a pair of black dress slacks or a pair of jeans paired with a black belt for a nice business casual look.
102404,1,"I buy it for a gift and the person who reseved it is very happy, they was in time and very good packing."
58324,1,"Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit, color, style and comfort. Washable, and wearable right out of the box, I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult"
299993,1,"Bought a pair in brown for walking my large dog. They provide me excellent support on our 2-3 mile daily walks. In fact, I liked them so well I bought this second pair. I highly recommend them. They run a little longer than other American brand shoes and I knew that from previous Clark's purchases."
54346,1,"They are the one pair of shoes you can't go wrong with. Wear them with shorts or jeans, always looks great!"
104395,1,"My grandson loved them,he has a hard time to find shoes,because of his foot size(14),so he was glad when I found them.The price on these are very reasonable & fast delivery."
308956,1,"Very comfortable work boot. Most comfortable work boot I have had yet. Do not know about the durability yet, if they last a year it will be worth every penny.12-20-2011 This boot is still holding pretty strong. I am starting to notice more foot fatigue at end of the work day. If you use a toe cover/guard - tuff toe always!"
20462,1,"Some products are a nice surprise - like this one. The shoes are nice, standard, white, going to the mall types but there's a twist: the black converse star can be changed out for one of nearly any color! Really, they come with several different colored logo stars that slide in and out easily so that your sneaks always match your outfit. Very cool feature!"
90524,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
34277,1,"These are the best wrestling shoes I have ever worn, and ever seen to date. The Velcro top makes matches much simpler since you don't have to tape your laces. The shoe is very comfortable and has an excellent look, I just wish I could get my hands on a pair again!"
316415,1,"Shoe is fine,but the laces won't stay tied,... I had to stitch them so they would stay tied..."
58460,1,"I can always get my narrow in width size - and the clean lines are perfect for all my casual needs. Mainly, though the size and width is perfect for me."
117161,1,I bought these as a present for my Dad & he loved them!They fit perfect & the quality is great.he was very happy =)
16272,0,"I was a little disappointed when I received my pair as they looked like they were poorly constructed. Initially, it felt like I was walking on cardboard. However, after wearing the shoes for a little while, they actually became quite comfortable."
290986,1,I have been wearing these shoes for about a month now and they feel great (only took about three days to break them in) they are indeed waterproof. I have walked through many rain storms and my feet are always dry. They seem to keep a shine well and the sole seems to wear down at a normal rate. I would suggest this show! :)
12380,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
162519,1,"Do not buy the first time! Without them I can not go skiing - legs are cold, with them I can go skiing for hours!"
352158,1,"Very lightweight, confortable and keep my feet cool. I highly recommend these sneakers. They may seem priced high, but they are worth the money."
72213,1,"These boots start off pretty hard on the feet. Once they are broken in they are very comfortable, considering how high the heel is. I've noticed that sometimes my legs and feet get a little sweaty if it's hot. But, the side zippers let you take em off quickly. The laces you should tie up tight, otherwise the tongue of the boots will move around constantly. Other than that the laces are mostly for show.I love these boots, they are very comfortable considering how high the heels are. They are worth the price in my opinion. Great for shows, or wearing out. Once they're broken in they're perfect anytime."
161393,1,"These shoes are what I was looking for..but, they do run a little big. So be sure to get a size down from your regular size. I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe..They are comfortable and you cant beat the price..shipping was pretty face as well."
119615,1,"I had to buy several Converse All-Star shoes for my newly formed basketball league. The wife recommended buying them at the German retail giant Kohl's. She wanted to use the 30% off coupon. But for some reason them Germans don't want to carry the in-between shoe sizes for those rare instances of humans that fit somewhere in the middle of 10 and 11.Thanks to the a seller on the Amazon Marketplace, I was able to get a pair at a comparable price that was shipped merely a day later after ordering! Yay to my new league getting to finally play their first game!"
311030,1,"I love these shoes. They are wonderfully comfortable, roomy yet supportive, and do not cut off the circulation, so as to make the foot swell. I like that they come in several widths. I have two pairs of them. ""Wash and wear"" is a bit misleading, since the directions are merely to wipe them with a wet cloth."
247154,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
57814,1,I'm very happy with this purchase. I love my new navy Keds! They came quickly and fit great!
142119,1,I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them. The last pair I had had something different about the instep that wasn't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful! I like them because they're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now!
28948,1,"I very much liked the shoe, but due to the fact that I have very narrow feet, it didn't fit. Great service ordering through Amazon."
374468,1,These shoes are broken in right out of the box. Comfortable enough to play or work in all day long. This is my second pair and I will buy another when the time comes.
328544,1,"This is an all-around great pair of wrestling shoes! I train MMA a little bit and with some of the drills the mats basically shave off the skin on my feet and I used to get blisters too! With these I get great grip and protection for my feet and if you tie them up correctly then you get good ankle support too.One thing, keep off of carpet while wearing them. Pet hair and lint sticks to the bottom like glue (the bottom is rubber in some areas) and therefore reduces traction until you clean them off (lick your finger and rub the rubber and it takes the dirt off).They are very comfortable too, and I have big feet so it's hard to find comfy shoes. I'd wear these everywhere if they didnt wet through so bad in rain and snow."
222047,1,but the soles didn't last longonce I took them to the shoe guy in chinatown to rebuild them with sturdy soles --- I got a great shoe
296723,1,"These are a great fit and are a good shoe for walking, the office and in casual settings.I will be ordering some brown suede Desert Treks soon."
240714,0,"These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use. There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles. I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same. On the positive, they are true to size. I wear a size 8 and they fit."
268398,0,"Shoe reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. Everyone is different, and what one likes may not be liked by others. I have tried several shoes over years and try to change them. I did not find these Adidas as comfortable as others. For me Brooks Brothers have been very comfortable for me. In stores we can try shoes and then buy. In amazon, one relies on reviews and unfortunately i cannot give a 5 star to this shoe as it did not feel comfortable to me."
143925,1,"These are them. Everyone wants them. They blew up this year and everyone is getting special colors, but the real deal are the gray suede."
132045,1,"These are classics! But dont buy any, cuz I want to be the only awesome person in the world."
16658,1,"The moment you put them on...they are broken in i.e. they do not give you blisters. They are light weight and they do not slide around on your foot and they are easy to ""cut"" with. Overall, these shoes are great and they seem to last a long time."
208514,0,"THE SHOES WERE CUTE, HOWEVER THE SIZES WERE NOT ACCURATE. I USUALLY WEAR A 9 - 9.5, AND ORDERED THE SIZE 10 AND THERE WAS NO WAY THEY WOULD FIT, NOT EVEN CLOSE. SO I HAD TO RETURN THEM."
100875,1,"These ballet shoes are nice quality and my 3 and 4 year old girls seem to really like them. I had to order a number of pairs to finally find the right fit. They seem to run a bit wide to me. The narrow sized worked well for my 3 year old. The &#34;lace&#34; would never stay tied, no matter the knot I used. Our dance teacher told us to use clear nail polish and it would keep the knot from untying. I, however, decided to just clip it off and it hasn't affected the fit."
275582,1,These boots are extremely comfortable and very waterproof. I use them for powerwasher and stay dry and comfortable even though I am on my feet for many hours.
220056,0,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
100680,1,"I ordered this pair of topsiders, looking for some cute summery shoes. (Gold Metallic) They are fantastic! I already own 1 pair of Sperrys (Bluefish 2 eye in Linen/oat) so I know how comfortable they are and how great they look with pants, shorts, skirts, and dresses. The color is almost exactly like the picture, more of a gold than silver. They are a different style than the pair I am used to, so I did order 1/2 size smaller than my other (7.5) I tried they on at my local Macy's, and knew I needed a little smaller since they have less padding and smaller sole than the Bluefish. The only thing I didn't anticipate in since the shoes are a metallic leather, when my feet sweat, they kind of squeak from the inside leather rubbing on my feet. I bought some slim socks that are made to hide in flats at Target and that solves the problem (They probably don't smell as bad either!) I was slightly disappointed with the leather cord they used as shoelaces. It feels kind of cheap and it's REALLY stiff. They may just need some time to soften up a bit, but for now they're hard to tie and keep tied. I could always buy some leather cord at Michael's too, but I'm hoping they soften. These are great shoes and I LOVE them! Have been wearing them 4 times a week for the past 4 months! I recommend them to anyone looking for cute summery shoes."
352562,2,"I'm not very pleased with these slippers. They don't fit very good and keep slipping off my heels, making it a little difficult to walk safely. What is your return policy? Respectfully,"
145372,0,"Being a female college student, I felt a necessity to own a pair or two of Uggs. Everybody wears them, but after my first winter in Michigan, I don't really understand why. Although they are super warm, they aren't waterproof (sucks for slushy days and wet snow), they don't have good traction (difficult to walk on snow and ice), and being made of sheepshin, they're difficult to clean. The salt put on the roads here damages them. I own the Ugg cleaning/care kit, and even that isn't enough to keep my Uggs looking good.I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who lives in a snowy place. Invest in some real snowboots."
7970,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
215929,1,"These were for my brother who requires sturdy and supportive sneakers with velcro closures for daily use. The extra wide width was a bonus, and they're very comfortable for him. They also arrived within very quickly. We're very satisfied."
364986,1,"I have been a fan of Converse since the day I saw Will Smith unpack a brand new pair in the movie iRobot. I wanted one for myself, where else amazon is the best place to buy. The Product price is very affordable except the shipping and handling costs. They are a bit high to Sri Lanka. Would be great if they are low too."
232568,1,Great product and very true to size. I would buy this product again. Thanks for making a shoe for a real woman....
154136,1,"I bought these shoes for Halloween to go with my Steve Zissou costume, and actually wear them all the time. They're so light and comfortable, I simply love them."
266021,1,These boots feel and fit great. I am interested in how long they will hold up. They look pretty sturdy. I will put them to the test for sure.
69063,1,"although i got my usual size, it was longer than i expected it to be, but it's very comfy and light. I like what i got!"
301225,1,"I have always like Grasshopper shoes and was pleased to see Amazon had a pair that would suit my needs. They arrived promptly, but sad to say, they were the wrong size. I had omitted to notice they were a W width and I have a narrow foot. The cost and trouble of returning them is not worth it, and nobody here that I know of wears a size 11W, so I'm stuck with them."
383158,1,"I love these shoes and have them in blue, white and black. I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts. fit true to size."
91291,1,"I bought these sandals for my mom because they looked nice and were from Softspots a company I love. She hasn't worn them out yet but reportrd them to be very comfortable. Just what we were looking for. Excellent product as usual. I highly recommend,"
266349,2,These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone.
124253,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
324759,1,"Ordering my third pair, no break in time,look fabulous too. I wear these boots about sixty hours a week for work and still are the first pair of shoes I grab to wear when I am not going to work. They will stretch fast so should be snug when first bought."
215755,1,"I am a highschool junior, who didn't start seriously running until track season of last year. I have a wide foot with low arches, and some amount of overpronation. I tried several pairs of Asics and Nikes last spring and over the summer, yet my knees were always sore, I was having ankle injuries, shin splints, etc. Finally, come XC season this year, one of the salesmen at a local shoe store told me I ""had to try"" these shoes. They were perfect. The shoes are supportive without being restrictive, and they corrected my overpronation without feeling unnatural (which was my complaint with one pair of Nikes I had.) These shoes have held up well. I've ran on average a little over 40 miles per week from the beginning of August until the middle of November and continued to run a little less than that for these past two weeks, and the shoes have held up very well. They feel as if they could very easily hold up another running season, though I've just ordered another pair of the same shoes to replace them.The shoes are supportive, yet non-restrictive and also light weight. The only complaint I have about them is that they seem to retain odor more than most running shoes. If you have feet that start to smell really bad (like mine) plan on using shoe deodorant.This is an excellent shoe for those with low arches, especially, but not only, those who require a wide toe box."
339875,1,These are awsome. just like shown. shipping took a while but it was over christmas so it makes sense. Just as nice as the pictures showed! Love the new CHucks
244195,1,"I really thought these were going to be cheaply made super small pouches.I was REALLY wrong. The construction is at least as durable as my $45.00 M.O.L.L.E. mag carrier, and they are large enough for an Iphone, an extra mag, and still has room for other items.If you are looking for good gear, Rothco items have served me well. Any time I look for gear Army Universe and Rothco are two names I look at FIRST."
363534,1,"These shoes are great,they can be worn down with jeans and a tee or worn with nice dress clothes.I'm getting the ones in pink.Get these shoes if considering.Very comfy also[Holla Back]"
348944,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
49715,0,The boot is attractive but the pictures make it seem as if the upper portion of the boot is more rigid but in reality it is not rigid at all. More flexible and doesn't look as good as if it was rigid.
52755,1,"Out of all 4 of my current Air Force military boots, this has to be the favorite. Wearing them, they feel like running shoes. They don't feel like your wearing you heavy combat boots. They're not steel or safety toed, they have a box toe only. If you want one of those installed in this, you're going to have to find a shoe guy somewhere in town to do it (I've seen them charge $50-people told me it's still worth it since they can only have steel toed boots in their job). If you're in the military, buy them at your MCSS (Military Clothing Sales Store) on base. At AAFES, they're under a hundred dollars ($98.95) and not tax of course. I do recommend you buy these. You have an excuse not to shine the rest of the boot since it has cloth and no worries of having it crack at the flexing point. I accidentally used a hose to wash vehicles, and the water didn't go through the cloth. They're not water proof, they're water resistant, so don't walk through a lake in them unless you have to. They dry fast since it's mostly cloth and not leather. My opinion, they look better than regular leather boots and require less polishing. If you do want someone to steel toe them and find a person to do it, they usually recommend to buy a half size larger than your foot."
95278,1,"I love them I wear them every day and have for 10 years now. They are great to work around the farm, ride and show my horses, and go to town. Super Super comfy! Ariats are great boots!"
59907,1,"I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
62340,1,These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price. I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe.
95866,1,I own 6 pairs of these shoes in different colors. They are classic flats! I wear them to work and for both casual and semi-formal events. You simply cannot beat them for comfort and style!
169133,1,nice shoe...pretty comfortable...just runs really small. From past reviews elsewhere I knew to order a full size up. I did and am so glad.
228400,1,Bought item for my bro...so all i can say is delivery was on time...Thank You!
177742,1,"I've worn these boots on week long backpacking trips through Yellowstone, Grand Canyon and Big Bend National Parks. They breath relatively well versus a full leather upper boot. The Vibram sole has excellent traction and is high quality. The boot is relatively water resistant, although it does not have a Gore-tex liner but water has never soaked through the boot. I really think Gore-tex liners are unnecessary unless you like to hike in very rainy areas. I've replaced the insoles with Spenco Backpackers for extra support under load. The only problem I've encountered is the rubber toe protection, which is part of the sole, has started to delaminate from the shoe. Great boot overall."
114594,1,"I ordered this with skepticism due to the confusion with sizes from other users. I took a chance and ordered for my 3 1/2 years old a size 9.5 M and it fits her perfectly. If it is a bit ""wide"", you can tighten the string to better fit the child's feet. I'm very happy with it and so is she. She didn't want to take them off."
3407,1,My husband loves these shoes. We always buy more than one pair at a time so he always has a pair.
315061,0,"I've owned 3 pairs of these.The soles are marking. If you stomp on something or drag your feet, you will leave dark thick black marks.The toe likes to come unglued from the sole. I reccomend shoe goo.The leather, if it can be called such, is coated with plastic of some sort. It's not spit shineable.The boots are decently light and somewhat wearable."
292173,1,"I look at photos of myself that are at least 15 years old and I'm wearing the Grasshopper Ashland or the canvas counterpart. I love these sneakers because they are so comfortable, stylish, and have a slight heel. I have had type 1 diabetes for 40 years and cannot wear sandals. These are great with shorts or jeans year round. I look fit and healthy for a 51 year old woman. It cracked me up when these shoes were delivered with a catalogue in the box featuring 85 year old women. So I say, whether you're 35 or 85, these are a great shoe choice."
322078,1,"After a year of looking at these shoes I finally decided to purchase a pair. I normally wear Vans or Converse but I found that I wear them down pretty quickly so I was looking for a change. Once my shoes were delivered I tried them on and instantly knew these were going to be my new favorite shoes. The soles are thick which is good for someone like me who walks everywhere and wears down shoes fairly quickly. The shoes come with extra cushion on the inside which provides perfect arch support so I don't feel as flat footed. I no longer feel like I'm walking around barefoot the way I did with my Converse. I was worried about the sizing being that I had never tried them on before but they fit perfectly, not too big and not too snug. I would recommend these shoes to everyone. In fact I already convinced my roommate to purchase a pair for herself."
145115,1,"Bought this for my wife and she loved them! Warm, comfy, etc., but they're not great in the snow. Not much more to say. Overall a good product...just wish they were less expensive! :-)"
252835,1,I've been looking at these or some time and saw them for $79 bucks.They normally go for over a hundred and I couldn't pass them up. I normally wear size 10 and they fit perfect. Really like the beeswax leather they stay nice and clean compared to the suede. Got them in quick 5 day via ups ground too. Now I'm a happy hipster!
155373,1,"Great buy, much better than wooden models! I needed to put some rubbing alcohol to help the leather stretch easier, the wooden kind disintegreated, these held up nicely and will last a long time."
351579,1,"This is the 3rd pair of Incans I have purchased. I prefer the model that has a little more structure around the sole but it is hard to find. This model, the neoprene upper one, is very comfy. It feels good with no socks on and washes well after you stink it up from wearing no socks. If you are buying this thinking like I did that it would be a velcro version of the Rhod casual you will be surprised. Though it looks very similar and has the same sole it is a much less substantial shoe. I am a big Tsubo fan but be warned they do no wear well, maybe it is because they are so comfortable that you wear them every day. I have one pair of Tsubos that seem to wear well and they have a leather upper but they fit a little snug so I never wear them all day. Tsubos are like kids shoes very flexible and compliant. They are addictive. They feel good the first time you put them on."
33727,1,i love these shoes. i ware them alot. i have three pairs red black and royal blue. one bad thing about them is you can not get shoelaces for them in the stores. i had to get them offline.
88676,2,I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality.
174266,1,"Even though these shoes are no longer made in England, their quality remains high.Very comfortable and easy to wear from Day One. Fits ""business casual"" or other""with a suit"" use too."
251972,0,"The shoe itself is decent. I've worn this style of Reebok for many, many years. Comfortable. Unfortunately, the high top is not high enough. The ultras, which are the high tops that I used to wear, are only available in very large sizes now and I can't wear them. They were high enough. Ah well, have to find another brand now that still makes the high tops high enough for me."
29017,1,"I bought a brown pair, then had to get this black pair. I'm a girl with wide feet (no, I'm not 300 lbs.), but I can hardly find walking/running shoes that fit right. I wear an 8Wide in Women's, but a 7M in Men's. They're comfortable with lots of cushion on the bottom. Worth every penny, but I'd also add some waterproofing spray to make them last a bit longer. I also like that they make me an inch taller, so I can reach the ground better with my scooter. Worth the money, folks, and a good deal for what you get."
246756,1,I have a 3 year old who is hard on shoes. These are good inexpensive boots that last a while . Its definitely worth the money
23625,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
200438,1,This was eactly what I was looking for. Perfect fit. Prompt Delivery.
111530,1,These shoes are awesome! they look great with everything. you will not be sorry you bought them.
368365,0,"THE SHOE SUPPOSED IS WIDE BUT IS NORMAL, I DONT KNOW WHY THE SIZE IS SO STRECH BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED"
377463,1,"While looking for a good pair of slippers for my husband I found these! They had to have good ratings, style and be comfortable! Well, these do not disappoint! He loves them and can even comfortably walk outside! A little pricey for slippers, but soooo worth it! I would buy them again! Heck, now I want a pair just like 'em!"
355565,2,"Sent with no box and unmatching tissue paper. These are my 3rd pair (First from this co.) but these are starting to fall apart after just a few times walking around (not skating or anything....actually just DRIVING around....not even walking.)I called and emailed numerous times trying to get a box. (Even though I paid full price for the shoes, I was willing to pay extra for the box.)No response from sellers for weeks....then got an email, ""So, you want us to send you a box?"" We don't have it anymore.""All of this makes me think they are cheap knockoffs...Very poor customer service/communication.Shoulda just bought them at the skateshop.=("
29477,1,"Great for walking, light weight and no strings to come untied. Very comfortable and hold up pretty good, I buy a new pair once a year."
305393,1,I'm using this shoe now because it is easy to get on. I prefer the world class walking shoe by rockport but it is harder to get on for me.
119196,2,"i am very interested in getting a pair of Puma Riberas, first i looked at the Puma website, but they do not ship to Canada. Now i've come here and found them, but you do not have any sizes higher than 8.5, what is the deal with that? If theres anyway i you could swing me a pair of Puma Riberas size 10 please let me know"
131085,1,"I have now had these shoes for a year and am still wearing them. They have been the best shoe, fit wise, comfort wise and price wise! I would certainly recommend them."
203669,1,"If you have to stand or walk a lot at work or on specific days, these shoes are perfect for you. They are comfortable & look good. I would recommend you to buy a half size up for your socks. Great buy!"
114188,1,The first pair that I got didn't fit and they were the wrong color. I sent them back and had the correct one within days. Perfect service and great product. Thank you! They made my 5 year old's day!
229891,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
79313,1,I have a very picky daughter when it comes to clothing... We went all over the place looking for some new shoes for school... She couldn't find anything that she liked so when I got home I gave her Amazon.com and had her look here.... She quickly picked these shoes and I ordered them.... They arrived three days later and she loves them.....Not one complaint!
219509,1,Product arrived as promised and in good condition. Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes.
127585,1,"These boots are even better than I had hoped. I bought them for a gift, and he absolutely LOVED them!! They shipped super fast and were true to size. He put them on out of the box and said they fit like they were made for him. I couldn't be happier."
13162,1,Definitely going to shop on Amazon at Roadrunners again. I got a great deal and then an extra $30 off because I bought 2 pairs. These Asics are a great go-to shoe for the intermediate runner.
68964,2,"I am a school teacher and have used the Florsheim Magna Force for the past 10 years. This year I decided to switch to the Florsheim Men's Noble Oxford. The heal of the Oxford has a rubber shock absorber bubble for ""more comfort"". The shock absorber bubble literally burst and ripped on both shoes. This may have been a defect but being that both shoes had the same problem troubles me. The company I used was endless.com and they have a great free return policy for a full refund. I decided not to buy the Noble Oxford's and instead will buy another Florsheim without the shock absorber bubble at the bottom of the heal."
11715,1,"Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors. Shoes are comfortable and sturdy, great for walking."
356606,2,"Like the fit, the style, the comfort-- but I have owned these sandals for &lt;3 months, and they are already starting to show significant wear at the toes (rubber is starting to ""fray""). For the price, I expected them to certainly weather the summer, but I'm not sure that will be the case (particularly since we have ""long"" summers here). I bought these to replace a pair of O'Neills I had for 3 years-- unfortunately they stopped making the model I liked/owned, so these were as close as I could find, but the quality is just not there-- definitely lacking. I would not recommend these, regardless of how ""novel"" the bottle opener on the bottom is. Who opens a drink with a shoe, after all (dirty-- eck!)?"
385235,1,"the shoes are very comfortable and were very well priced, however the styling is a little outdated with the big squared off front, but hey, function over fashion!"
353161,1,"I have had these shoes for 2 months, not a problem noted, seamless design, to spots for irritation, and I have not had any problems with sqeaking."
16763,0,"I am sure they are great on real grass with the right size. One thing I noted is that they are bigger than what the guide says. I am a 10.5 regularly but they feel like a 11 or 11.5! In addition to that, I got the worse shin splints and hip pain playing on turf and sun backed grass! Unimaginable pain. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the playing surface.Conclusion: Get these one size smaller, and use them on firm natural grass fields."
383865,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
200215,1,I have been purchasing these shoes for several years and have never been disappointed in the quality and comfort of these shoes. They always meet my expectations.
66962,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
291786,1,"I ordered these boots in black for my toddler son's cowboy costume. These boots are way better than costume quality. They are absolutely beautiful and well made. They will last my son a long time and are perfect for every day play. They run true to size so don't worry about the fit. I love these boots, they are worth every penny."
172169,1,"Love em, love em, love em.... I think these boots are fabulous.... Comfy, cute, and cheap--If that ain't the trifecta i don't what is! Just buy 'em"
234278,1,"Great score. These shoes are all around nice shoes. They fit the bill for me. I bought a black pair first. I like simple, great fit, easy cleaning, styleish, modern, light, and a fair price.Arrived on time and well packed."
22049,1,"Could not be more satisfied. Probably the most comfortable casual boot I have ever had. I now wear these every day to work... in an office setting. Great style, and are holding up just fine. Short period for break in and now they are perfect. I hope they still have this style when I need a new pair, but the way it looks it may be quite a while."
188772,1,These have got to be the most comfortable shoes in the world! I love KEENs but these are even more comfortable that my other pair (flip flops). These are nice enough to wear to work. They look good no matter what you're wearing. They are worth every penny!
210698,1,I have purchased this same shoe in 3 colors over the years.I love Mocs and especially those made of deerskin or moose hide as they are supple and conform to the contour of you feet and then fit like a glove.I say - buy them.
53662,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
371546,1,This pair of boots is very light in weight and comfortable to wear. Very good for the cold weather. Nice boots. 5 starts
261036,1,"This is the second Converse Low Top I bought this week because of sizing error(my fault). I ordered a size 10 in Mens the first time because I'm a legit size 10.5 Mens in every other shoe I wear. The shoes were received quickly by mail and the quality is great. When I tried them on, I had a good amount of space inside the shoes to move my toes which was too much for me. These size 9.5 shoes are a perfect fit. The sellers advice is spot on about sizing. Order 1 size down from your usual shoe size if you want a good fit. Other than that, these shoes are great for casual walking and weight training. I use them for dead lifting and squatting. Definitely recommend these shoes to anyone!"
34136,1,"The shoes were perfect but my Mother needed a 9.5 N and the shoe came in as a 9N and I had to return it. It cost me $15.00 to return the shoe and I wanted the right size but I received the credit for the shoes only on my credit card but not for the shipping either way! So I wasn't happy and probably won't use this service again.Thanks,kathy"
325312,0,Actual size was about a full size maybe even two sizes smaller than what they were labeled as. Had to return them. Pink glitter was all over the floor by just trying on one shoe so beware of glitter shedding
254022,1,"They had the right variety and a low price. It was a timely delivery, just what I ordered."
316792,1,"I was cautious in &quot;breaking in&quot; this shoe for fear of toe problems from another shoe brand. However, there was no problem with breaking in THIS shoe. Definitely will stick with the Ozweego Classic. Very lightweight, stylish but most of all COMFORTABLE."
49061,1,"When I saw these shoes at the store, the sales guy told me Runner's World voted them #1. I looked at him suspiciously and thought, ""Reebok makes a good *running* shoe!?"" He saw my face and said, ""I know, even the RW article said 'we can't believe we're saying this, but...'"" So, I tried them on and they fit wonderfully!Although I have fairly wide feet, there isn't any tightness and the heel holds well. Decent stability, good cushioning.... I like that the arch allows your foot to flex (unlike most stability shoes out there these days - the ones with the rigid arch that lays flat on the road). I also have a flat foot and over-pronate; I wear my orthotics in the shoes and still take my regular size.So far, my longest run in these shoes has been about 45 minutes or 5.5 miles. I've worn them about 5 times. I'll update the review if I find anything wrong.Oh - I bought these shoes for $59 at Sports Basement in San Francisco. They were such a great price I bought two pair. But mine are blue, not that nice gray color ;-)"
77576,1,"I can walk all day in these shoes. The first time I wore them was running from work to the opera, and I remember thinking to myself as I dashed on and off the metro-- I'm not hurting!! The height is perfect. I got them in black but am now looking for a backup pair as well as another pair in beige or red. These run true to size and show no toe cleavage. Hard to slip in these, too."
148013,2,These are cheap copies of the SAS originals. I purchased and returned a pair of these imitations. The SAS shoes were comfortable from the instant I put my feet into them. Not so the copies.
242523,1,"Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel"
145525,1,"The boots are ALIVE. When I put my foot inside, the shearling wrapped around and through my toes and foot. Wonderful! Even a half size too small, I didn't want to take them off. Needless to say, I returned them. I did not reorder the long boot because if you have big legs, your pants won't fit inside. I am going to order the Ultimate Short Boot so that my pants will fit over them. As always, AMAAZON service is great."
145752,1,"Its a bit overrated and overpriced, but uggs classic boots are super warm and cozy to wear. I do like the tall boots because of the fold down looks that you can get out of one boot. Problem is that the sole support is not that great. For the amount of money, I expect to be able to walk in these boots as if they were sneakers. I am a size 7.5, but a 7 fit me perfectly."
87550,1,I LOVE these SHOES!!!! My mom got them first at some store. She couldn't remember where so I searched for them on Amazon. Found them! They are so cute and COMFORTABLE!!!LOVE THEM!!!!
91097,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
155184,0,"After reading the reviews I decided to give these tennis shoes a try. They are not very comfortable to me. They are made for people with narrow feet. I had to leave the strings loose until the shoe stretched/broke-in. Even after they broke in they are still too tight for a Tennis Shoe. As far as support, they do help and when on your feet for long periods you do not feel the fatigue as with other brands. If they were wide enough I would rate them higher."
273025,1,"This is just one man's opinion, so take it for what it's worth, but i honestly believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would realize that sandals are for big sweaty comic book readers, and he would wear the sleek aerodynamic adidas Men's Tuscany NYL size 9 (i assume that Jesus' feet are a size 9). That's all speculation however, so now for some Tuscany facts:a.) just looking at these shoes makes you faster2.) they are orange, so you won't get shotd.) i personally own 7 pairs of these speed shoesI suggest these shoes to everyone and everything...men, women, animals, children, creatures, and everything else."
179778,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
318655,0,"Now, if you're a typical person, you'd probably find this shoe to be soft under foot. However, I stand for hours a day (teaching) and I found this shoe to be lacking. It ain't soft enough for my long-suffering feet and it's certainly less comfortable than a typical running shoe. If your workplace allows you to wear running shoes, just do it. You'll be happy you did. In that case, may I recommend to you the Asics GT-2170? It has a super-soft MIDSOLE, which is the IMPORTANT PART for comfort. I'm basically a shoe expert at this point in my life, and I must advise those who are looking for a comfortable shoe--I mean really soft!--to LOOK UNDER THE INSOLE AND PRESS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE MIDSOLE. If the midsole (under the insole) is hard, or even hard-ish, you will NOT be comfortable unless you have numb feet that are immune to pressure. So don't be fooled by super-soft-feeling insoles made of puffy, fluffy, light foam. They will compress on top of a hard midsole, and you'll be hurtin' and as irritated as two wet cats in a bag."
102332,1,"The fit is GREAT. The quality could be better, but at that price you can buy a new pair every month."
88552,1,"I usually get a 9.5W in sandals, but the footbed was too long in this shoe and the back straps were way too loose. I reordered in a 9W and they fit a lot better, not perfectly.. but they are really cute. I throught they were pretty comfortable until I could feel the side of the zipper on one shoe cutting into my big toe. Hopefully it won't happen again!"
89989,1,"In case of excessive rain and slush this winter I ordered these CLC Rain Wear size 10 boots. They looked good and when I tried them on wearing the heavy socks I will use with these in winter, they fit well.My normal size is a 9 wide. I like to wear thick socks for comfort and warmth so the size 10 in these boots was just right. They are comfortable, look well-made, have a decent tread that will grip mud, snow, and slush for better safety walking.For people who complain about the top part irritating the leg, well, just tuck your pants in the boot. Or, better yet, wear thick socks, like skiers use, which come up the calf almost to the knee. These will give greater comfort and reduce/eliminate any irritation to the flesh on the leg.Everybody needs boots like these, sometimes. Like now. There is no guarantee you won't have to face flooding conditions, walk in heavy mud, or deal with slush everywhere all winter. These will keep your regular leather shoes and boots from being ruined - at little cost, too! RECOMMENDED."
204152,1,"I'm surprised to hear these fell apart on someone. We bought these about 5 months ago and they get worn frequently. They have a nice rubberized sole, wash well (we don't put them in the dryer - we air dry) and they keep our daughters feet super warm (she wears a 13-1) and the sole is great for our hardwood floors and stairs. No slipping. Highly recommend these for quality & functionality (and cuteness of course :)"
233472,1,"I ordered this product because i wanted a stash pocket like other ipath shoes. I was disappointed when i opened the box to find no stash pockets in the tongue. Its a, great comfortable shoe other than that."
154984,1,"These where the brand I wanted, came quickly, and fit well. They where also at a great price compared to getting in the local dance shop."
91637,1,"These boots certainly 'send a message' when wearing them. I just wish they were available in 3"" heels and no platform. I love what it does to guys when I do wear them! They fit well and the material stretches to fit a little so they look great. Just be careful walking on the platforms!"
306719,1,"This is an incredibly comfortable and stylish.the correct sizewonderful velvety nubuckI received many compliments and praiseI am glad to have these boots!They are worth every penny, I recommend to all"
268291,2,No problem with the delivery. The actual clog is very heavy and each step is a battle to keep the shoe on. After wearing them for a very short time my legs and feet began to hurt!
37715,1,Danner makes some truly outstanding boots. I don&#8217;t buy there china made products but a pay the big bucks for their USA made footwear. You wear shoes or boot roughly half of your life. It pays to buy the best.
304036,1,this is my second pair of darongas. they are the most comfortable shoe i own and i wear them with everything and always get lots of compliments. i hope addias never stops making them.
256829,1,Spira Men's Classic Leather Walking Shoe is an excellent shoe. It feels good when walking. I don't have as much backache when wearing these shoes.
357630,1,"These cute dance shoes were just perfect for my daughter to wear in an upcoming musical at her high school. Luckly her friend ordered them prior to us, and took other reviewers suggestions to order a size up to heart. My daughter wears a size 8 usually but a size 9 in these fit perfectly! We were lucky to have her friends shoes to try for sizing before we ordered or I might have gone with only a half size larger. She states they are comfortable and easy to dance in. I recommend these just be sure to order a full size larger!!"
253953,1,The shoe I bought was extremely cool! The last time I had a shoe like this was about three years ago. Its a Vans Omar Hassan all black super suede pretty much like this design. The difference was eS was more rugged and tough looking than the Omar Hassan series. I would love to see eS create more designs in the same super suede all black series. You can wear it likewise in semi-formal attire. My only regret is that I didnt bought a spare one for the future.
95436,1,"Great product just what I wanted color is perfect also size, I love these sandals. I've had these before, only different colors, so I knew the size and they always fit. Fast shipping also. Thanks."
220586,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
140358,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
176056,2,Most uncomfortable boot ever. Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get. I hope they ( break in ) some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash. JUNK JUNK JUNK
200959,1,I have been purchasing these shoes for several years and have never been disappointed in the quality and comfort of these shoes. They always meet my expectations.
171849,1,Very nice shoes. Comfortable and aggressive at the same time. The heel on them is amazing. It makes me want to heel hook everything! I got mine in a half size smaller than my normal shoes.
136674,1,"Lord, could Converse have got it any more right? One thinks not. The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more. They are stylish, available in colours that vary from orange to pink, the more comtemporary leather versions, low cut and high cut. These baby's contour the foot so well,it's almost like walking on air! The canvas hugs the ankles, providing support...but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex (they look great on guys and girls) and they can be dressed down with jeans, or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants. These shoes are definitely to die for."
156547,1,I had these before and they ware great.Long lasting and a good shoe. Buy themand you will never go backto the old ones.Kay
207803,1,"I am a runner and have worn the ""response"" for the past three years. It has great cushion, stability and a wider toe box than other brands. I haven't had a blister in years! The breathable mesh keeps my feet cool on long runs and they last - I've put over 800 miles on this latest pair."
350415,0,"I bought these for a four-week vacation in which these were the only shoes I could use as I travel very light. I bought the sandals because they looked well ventilated, they are waterproof and based on the price should be well constructed.Pros: The foot bed conforms to your feet over a periodThey are very comfortable even when walking for several miles over uneven surfaces.They are well constructed and show no wear after walking 300+ miles.Cons: The toe cap will make your toes sweatThey dry very slowly and should not be considered if you are in and out of water... unless you are ok with your feet being wet for 4+ hours.They hold on to odor. After 4 or 5 days, I needed to wash the shoes every evening due to the smell (and they were never fully dry in morning after 8+hours of drying). I have owned Birkenstocks, Tevas and other sandals and never had the same level of issues with odor.These are ok sandals but I wouldn't buy them again."
314417,1,"Resists moisture really well. My feet have stayed dry during snowy/wet weather. Only time will tell about summer time wear on hot and rainy days. However, it's taking longer than I had anticipated for the instep to break in, so my feet feel a bit tired by the end of my work day. Other than that, it's a great boot."
318511,1,I have been ordering this shoe for my wife for years and she will wear nothing else for comfort and fit
299803,1,"Great purchase -- good price, easy. what more could you want."
93690,1,"With these boots I've walked through floods, traversed slums, worked with the poor, did some constructions, worked at farms, as a humanitarian all across Asia Pacific this past year. Let me tell you these boots have been through some tough conditions and they still look and feel good after a little over a year of rugged use. Sole is still in tack and the laces are still in good condition, the outer wear looks just as it did when I bought it with a few rugged battle dings from my volunteer work.One of the highlighted features of the boot is the waterproof claim, and at feet level right bellow the laces it's able to do just that. I tested this beyond typical conditions if you will...After some heavy weather I was volunteering at a farm and a rain catcher needed draining, except its drain was clogged and it wasnt visible enough to pull out due to build up, so we had to manually bucket out the water. While some of the local farmers had rain boots on, many of the volunteers had none and were warned not to enter the pool because the water probably harbored some diseases. Realizing I had the ""waterproof"" plate bellow the bootlace I decided to test it out, and it worked! After several hours of standing in water helping clear out the rain catcher my feet were completely dry! (at one point I thought water had seeped in but later found out the water was just cooling off the shoe) Of course anything above the waterproof logo would seep in, its just commonsense after that since the lacing is open.In terms of style, it looked awesome when I bought it (got the ""charcoal"" one), and the minor dings I got from my volunteer work just added more value to it.I have since bestowed on it the title of my ""World Proof Boots""If you don't have a pair, you're missing out in a world of action my friend!"
313642,1,"Budget Jungle Boots Avalible From ""[...]"" - Constant wetness is the main problem in the jungle, with the need for ankle support and protection from sharp sticks and rocks. With rubber soles, these boots keep out water from damp ground while allowing the feet to breath through the canvas uppers. After wading a river, the action of walking squirts water out of special steel vents in the instep. The cleats are wide and deep for good grip on wet ground. This is very good boots!"
259270,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
297584,1,"I'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a &quot;speciality sport&quot; shoe. When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago, the comments I got from friends were along the lines of &quot;I thought they made baseball [or volleyball] shoes.&quot;But, trust me: Mizuno makes great running shoes. The Wave Rider is - in my mind - the best 'cushion' shoe on the market today. With this seventh generation release of the model, Mizuno demonstrates it understands three important things about running shoes:- Most runners want a good high-mileage shoe for under $100. [The Wave Rider has stayed under $90 retail for all seven model releases.]- When runners find a shoe they like, they get ripped when the company either drops the model or radically re-imagines it for the next release. The Wave Rider has been incrementally tweaked and improved over the years, but the basic shoe remains the same.- I'm a runner. I don't want a hip, street shoe where style is first, running mechanics second. The Wave Rider is where it ought to be on the spectrum: there's a nod towards style, but I don't feel like a fashion victim.One sizing note: I traditionally take an 11 in all other types of shoes, but I need an 11.5 for the Wave Rider. That's been very consistent throughout the years."
344841,0,"I was a little more than disappointed to see ""Made In China"" in these boots (I was led to believe that Justin were all Made in the USA, and that's part of the reason I bought these). In that respect, the product info was misleading.Also; the felt lining in the heel area only lasted a few wearings before it tore and bunched up, so I can't walk very far without feeling like I've got a blister coming on. The black rubber sole just seems cheap, and they feel off-balance (compared to other boots that I own) when I'm walking in them.Overall, I'm disappointed with the manufacturing and quality, but will probably still keep them since I sit at a desk most of the time.If you're going to work or walk in these boots, I don't recommend them."
320220,1,My daughter needed shoes for her dance class. I found these on amazon and I liked that they were in leather and the price even with shipping could not be beat elsewhere. I ordered the 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly. They are lightweight. Very soft leather with no break in period. Shipping was speedy just in time for her to start her class! Highly recommended to all
334453,1,I don't remember exactly how long I have owned my first pair of these boots but I know they are at least 6 to 7 years old and still going strong. They have been my daily wear boots for at least 5 of those years and have seen hundreds if not over a thousand miles. They are by far the most comfortable boots I have ever owned. The square toes give you plenty of room and the insoles are perfect. The soles are finally wearing through but are definitely still good enough for daily use. I use them for everything from hiking in the summer to snow blowing in the winter. I apply waterproofing (sno-seal) once a year and I have never gotten wet feet. I intend on using my new boots as more formal boots while still using my old ones for daily use. I simply cannot say enough good things about these boots!!!!
58561,1,"I love these shoes! And after you get them broken in (takes a little while), they are adorable and comfy! But they are definitely not for people with wide feet. They seem to run a little narrower than shoes I normally buy. But they're fantastic shoes nonetheless!"
152435,1,"Loved the Sanuks, the fit is perfect as always and the colors are so vibrant. I've had several people comment on them. I've owned numerous pair of Sanuk's and I think this pair is my favorite by far."
121161,1,"These are traditional leather brogues- or oxford wingtips in US speak - as some have noted in previous reviews they need 'wearing in' as the leather is stiff when new but they mould to the foot and quickly form into excellent fitting footwear. Great price, great presentation. Hard to beat for value/function/price."
238037,1,"I have been looking for a shoe like this at shoe stores. No luck. This was probably more money than I wanted to spend, but they are extremely comfortable and I really love them. The tan color goes with just about everything! The last pair I had (not this brand, but leather) lasted forever--so I guess I can't complain about the price. You get what you pay for!"
244970,1,"Just bought this for my son's school uniform and I like that its very light weight and the soles have a little cushion, lets hope this last until the end of school year. I will definitely buy this again for next year."
142163,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
188307,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
263128,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
363900,1,I LOVE these slippers. My boyfriend got them for me after I wore the last pair literally to shreds. I love putting them on as soon as I get home from work and being on my feet all day. It's like heaven for my tootsies. I love these slippers almost as much as I love him! Thank you Baby!
137959,1,"Love these shoes! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best! Great price and super fast shipping! Couldn't,t be happier!"
278254,1,"Excellent! Great product, great fit. Best price anywhere. Actually I still have these and wear them every day. I am actually going to order another pair very soon. Thanx"
1565,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
198655,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
349610,1,its a good place to buy ur shoes u get ur products on time.
51270,1,"But I love these! I can't believe I spent so many years buying cheap alternatives! The first time I put them on, I couldn't believe the amount of support that was offered. Every single centimeter of my foot was supported. I work with severely handicapped children, and my body goes through alot at work. The pain in my feet and knees disapeared when I started wearing these shoes."
37831,1,"The only casual shoe my husband will wear. He wears them to work every day, and goes through about 2 pair a year. He is hard on shoes and these hold up very well. He says they are the most comfortable shoe he can find. Most stores no longer carry this style. I was very happy to find them with the help of Amazon.com."
126718,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
375873,1,"I have very flat feet and have to put arch support in my shoes or else I'm in a lot of pain. After much searching and trying different brands, these are all I wear now. Theywear very good and stay nice looking."
148909,1,"These are very nice looking boots, classey but yet they can be worn with jeans. The company is very professional and their right on it, no complaints about anything!"
304140,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
154880,1,didnt have a problem with these they are exactly as you see them. the right color and true to size
279477,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
154990,1,Great shoe very cute. True to size and good quality My 2 yr old lives them. She wears a 6.5. The first pair I ordered were (6.5) fit just right so I returned and ordered a 7. That was perfect with just a little room to grow.
181547,1,"Great boots,waterproof,attractive,fit true to size,highly recommended. Looks identical to photo,genuine Timberland boots. Great on rainy days,clean up well. Identical to the man's version of this boot."
281170,1,i ordered 2 pairs of these.... the wheat and the white these things fit great!! i went clubbing the 1st night in a.pair... they didn't put the ole..new shoe crunch on my toes. Plus they look great
274356,1,"They really do keep any water from getting in, and they are quite warm! Don't know what I'd do without them with winter coming along."
241625,1,The shoe itself is cute! Very bright colorful...and well pink. The only worry/complaint i have is that maybe its a bit too big? Maybe the reviews i read after i bought the item scared me making me wish that i would have gone down a size. So instead of an 8 maybe a 7.5 would have been nice? Well what can you do...you cant shrink em and they are cute. Im sure i can work it all out! The delivery estimate of the package was right on time. The seller was awesome! So all in all its pretty good :P
322113,1,"I've been doing ballet-style workout DVDs at home lately, and wanted a pair of ballet shoes to use for those workouts so that I'd have better grip and support. I can't speak to how well these work for ballet classes, but I thought that my review might help others like me who are buying these for the same reason.Based on some reviews, I ended up ordering these at first one size larger than what I usually wear in my street shoes. The 8.5 that I bought (instead of my usual 7.5) were huge, but (thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy), I returned these and ordered a 7.5, which fit perfectly.The ribbon at the front of the shoe can be pulled tight to adjust the width of them, and they are very comfortable. They don't have a split sole on the bottom; instead, the sole is one long piece that stretches down the length of the shoe.If you're looking for some at-home ballet-style workouts, I also recommend Mary Helen Bowers'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body WorkoutandBallet Beautiful: Body Blastand Leah Sarago's four workouts, especially her newest oneBallet Body Signature Series: Total Body. All of these are a lot of fun to do, and make me feel like a ballerina!"
156095,1,"great quality! the strap over the foot is nice and thick, seems very comfortable. the bottom of the shoe if we'll put together."
199661,1,NIce pair to have at 14$. The heel is not too high or low its exactly that we want to be..
21132,1,"I've got these shoes in 10EEEE size for Grandma. Her feet and ankles swell with water. She has trouble finding socks that will fit, forget the shoes! But these ones were different. She easily put her foot in, velcro opened all way up, and first thing she said: - feels comfortable."
341824,1,"Didn't have time to ""break"" my new shoes in before leaving for a trip to New York City. Didn't need to. I put them on for our flight (nice to be able to just slip them off to go through security) and wore them the entire time walking for miles each day seeing the sights of NYC. Very comfortable, true to size. Plan to buy another pair (in a different color). I got the black/silver ones - not much silver, they are a shiney black with black fabric. Highly recommend for anyone planning a trip where you will be doing lots of walking and want something a little dressier than athletic shoes."
160272,1,"No hay zapatos mas c&oacute;modos y duraderos que estos cl&aacute;sicos... Lucen con todo tipo de vestimenta y como dicen, lo cl&aacute;sico nunca pasa de moda."
311040,1,"My husband loves these shoes because they slip on just like a loafer. With the elastic collar they grip his foot well so that he can easily walk on uneven terrain. The wash and wear function is a real plus in our climate. While I have thrown an older pair in the washer, I usually wash them with a brush and rinse off. They wear well and hold their shape even after washing. This is the third pair I have purchased."
272039,1,"HELP!, I need somebody, HELP! Not just anybody....and soforth. I cant buy these shoes ANYWHERE!!! Ive searched all over and they either dont have them in my size or I just cant buy them. this site wont let me buy them cuz it isnt listened as a product i can buy... i have no idea why. If any1 has any information on where i can get my hands on these shoes please email me at: stevemosca@hotmail.com"
359710,1,"I bought these for my son for track season. They held up superbly during training season as well as track season. He had no problems breaking them in. They were used for running on grass, sand, mulch and concrete with no problems. He has been using them for running since track season has ended. They still look fantastic and are not showing substantial wear.I believe they are worth the money because they didn't cause him pain or any foot problems. We will buy a new pair each season. I highly recommend these."
381585,1,After I got the right size these where the most comfortable dress shoes. I don't dance I just wanted a pair of dress shoe that I could actually walk in. I had to get a whole size larger then my normal tennis shoes. I normally where a 9 But I had to get a 10. I first got a 9.5 but they were just a bit to small. Unfortunately the company has a restocking fee which make sending them back cost almost as much as the shoes. So do yourself a favor and get a whole size larger.
150293,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
381539,1,I bought these shoes for my 15 year old daughter to wear on stage while acting. I was apprehensive about ordering on-line because she has a wide foot and typically has a hard time finding shoes that fit. I ordered a half size up in wide and they were a perfect fit. They are comfortable on her and easy to walk around in. I'm sure she will get a lot of wear out of them.
299713,0,"The color of the shoe is much, much darker than the photo on Amazon. The picture looks medium brown. I suppose with &#34;antique coconut&#34; I should have realized that they meant the very dark outside of the coconut and not believed the &#34;picture&#34; as reference"
70783,1,I got these shoes as a birthday gift for my mother and she just loves them! She has knee problems so I was looking for a shoe that would provide stability and help her workout without pain. These do a great job!
37717,1,I love the style of this boot so much~~ Everything is perfect expect its weight. Next time I think I will buy a less heavier danner boot.
55962,1,These Keds are hard to find anymore. They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort. She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive.
359601,1,"I had always wondered why so many people were wearing around such an unattractive shoe. Then I decided to get a pair because I needed something to wear around in the garden that I could easily wash off. When I put them on, I finally understood. These shoes are soooooo comfortable!! I also always imagined that feet would get really sweaty inside this 'rubber' shoe, but that's not the case at all. They are very well ventilated. The lack of sweat is probably also due to the fact that there is a LOT of extra room inside the shoe - the sizing on this style runs really large. I could definitely have gone with a size under my usual size.I have now discovered that Crocs also makes lots of other (much cuter) styles, and I've ordered several pair!"
131404,1,"I've been wearing these flip flops since the day they arrived, about a month ago. They actually provide good arch support! I walk a lot, and my feet are not tired at all after several miles; they are almost as good as my running shoes. They EVA footbed molds to your feet after about a week; during the breaking-in period they strap irritated my feet a little but nothing to the point of blistering. I would definitely recommend these flip flops.When I decided that I needed an upgrade from less durable foam flip flops (I was wearing a pair from Victoria's Secret) I was debating between these and Rainbows; I eventually chose these because it took less time and effort to break them in, and for the price I got these at, I could buy three pairs of Reefs for the price of one pair of Rainbows. I am completely satisfied with my decision."
266204,0,"I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
231450,1,"These are perfectly comfortable, I have had these boots before, so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget. I wear a ladies 5.5-6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great!"
23389,1,I bought these flip flops for my husband. He received a pair from his son but they were a size too big. He enjoyed them still and wore the heck out of them. When I saw these at such a great price I had to get them for him! I bought the size that fits his foot better and he has thoroughly enjoyed them!
56155,1,"This is probably my 10th pair of these sneakers. I wear them to death. Not fancy...comfortable...goes with all casual clothing and very ""smart"" looking. Very Audrey Hepburn."
108603,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
99611,1,"Buy it, the special volleyball shoe, its beautifull and confotable, the price is the 40% from the original price."
101599,1,"As a crossdresser, it is extremely hard for me to find nice heels in a womens 13.5 that don't look like old lady shoes! These are fantastic, comfortable, and very sleek looking!"
245297,1,"Back to the trusty Alley Cats! I Discovered sketchers boot/style shoes about 10-12 years ago. Now they are refered to as Oxfords. Loved the style(they look great for every most occasions) and at that time they were in style. Well, I usually would buy a new pair of Skechers every year same type of shoe the Skechers oxford boot/shoe. Then about 4-5 years ago I saw everyone wearing these what looked like ""Bowling Shoes"" made by Shechers. So, wanting to stay somewhat stylish, I strayed and been wearing multiple versions of these ""stupid flat-footed stylish bowling shoes"". Well basically I've had horrible back pain for the last 4 years. Been to all kinds doctor's, they all had different reasons never really fixing anything. I had just assumed the back pain was due to age(42). I got sick of trying to find some good comfortable shoes stylish shoes. Decided I'd try what worked before... And after a few days of wearing the old Alley Cat's... I'm happy to say ""I'm Back"". And for some reason my back pain is gone. Hard to explain, but the ""thick sole"" and arch support, roominess are what works for me. 3 pair of these later... feet/back/my stance feel great! I don't care what the newest styles are, THESE ARE CLASSIC'S and I'll wear them to the Grave!"
168925,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
269354,1,i wear a wide shoe and have a hard time finding one that's comfortable under $100. i was skeptical about buying the rockport prowalker. well i've been wearing the shoe for a month now and am very pleased with the way they feel. imagine a shoe that feels this good under $50.00. i will definitely buy this shoe again.
72715,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for YEARS! My sisters tease me about my ""ugly"" shoes but they're so comfortable that I don't care-let them tease! I wear these in both black and brown and they're actually the only shoe I wear. I am a postal employee with a walking city route and walk about 12 miles each day and these are the shoes I wear. I love them! The leather relaxes fairly quick but does not really stretch out. After about 6 months of everyday walk and wear the bottom cracks but that's to be expected, I'm HARD on these shoes and they're still sooo comfortable!"
81830,1,"Another great shoe from stride rite, these shoes lasted through 2 or 3 washings and the lights still worked and they looked great."
149365,1,"These things fit good (if you use a half size, I recommend you round up though), are very comfortable and look good to boot. I have had these stolen off of me TWICE and went back and bought a new pair both times. They're that good. If you ever feel like they're dirty you can just throw them in the washing machine and they will look as good as new."
389776,1,they are so confortable and so cool and nice too wear.i love them and i would buy 10 more if i could.
286230,1,These boots were okay. One side of one of the boots was a little crinkled but when my niece put her foot in it it straightened out. Little disappointed because the boots never came with any type of receipt or invoice.
367379,1,I love these shoes! They are comfortable and stylish. I have gotten nothing but great complements from them. Well worth the money!
65631,1,"I bought these boots for both every day wear and dress they just dont wear well they look good to, I had found another pair of boots for stepping out at a local store and tried to cancel the order but it shipped out before I could. When I recieved the boots I checked them out I was very impressed with the workmanship and decided to keep them!"
347216,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
32344,1,"This is a fabulous running shoe, good for high mileage in tremendous comfort. Lots of stability. I actually use it mostly offroad trailrunning (prefer this over trail-running shoes) but trailrunning does take a toll. Good for 400 miles."
207479,1,"This is the shoe I am currently using for basketball. It is very sturdy, well built, and strong. It took a while to break them in and because of the synthetic upper they sort of squeak when you walk. But besides this minor annoyance they are overall a decent ball shoe for a reasonable price. I really like the three response pads....seems to give you extra traction and support. All around good shoe."
15317,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
352971,1,"I bought these shoes to wear to my college classes. The hard sole is good for outdoors, however they are slippers and it is hard to walk any distance in them. If you are walking more than 1/2 a mile, it gets difficult to keep these shoes on your feet. You constantly have to use your toes to grip them and they will flip off of your heels. I would suggest them, as long as you don't plan on going far in them. Also, the grey is really cute and looks nice with jeans!"
130599,1,"I like the look of most of the a3's but this one is a bit goofy looking in my opinion. Like the other a3's it is a good quality shoe, light and cool and well constructed. Amazon has great prices on these for some reason. It keeps me coming back."
383655,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
321647,0,"I gave it a 3 star rating because although the moccasins are nice looking, they are not true to size and that in itself, presents a problem for the person wearing them."
91744,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
167677,1,"I've always been the weirdo who hated flipflops despite their enormous popularity. I hated seeing all the hundreds of cute styles that I just couldn't wear because they went between my toes and it made me so uncomfortable that I couldn't stand it. This is the first flip flop I've ever bought and now I wear it basically every day. I've gone back and bought more pairs and would pay twice what they are listed and still be super happy. They aren't just a flipflop I can wear... they are truly the single most comfortable shoe I've ever worn IN MY LIFE! They have a bit of arch-support, the cute criss-cross straps provide support spread across the foot so it isn't all pulling between the toes, and the shoe itself is super-squishy. I am totally in love with this shoe!!!"
278285,1,Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!
119484,1,"They are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn. Bought a for a friend & my daughter, who also love them"
7291,1,"These are the only shoes that I can fast walk in. I walk 5 miles a day. After a while other shoes tend to rub my feet. The Romy have plenty of room, a thick cushioning and are very well made. I love them. I wore the last pair I had for 1 year and hated to throw them away because they were still comfortable. but I figured that after a year it was time to get a new pair. You can't go wrong with these shoes."
105851,1,Bought for my daughter. She loves the fit and they look very cute on. She is very trendy so these fit the bill nicely.
81839,1,I am getting ready to order my third pair of these very comfortable shoes - they last about 3-4 years.
327038,0,"These sandals are really cute and look great, but they are not really comfortable and I don't wear them if I have to be on my feet for a long time. The fabric between the toes is not as soft as others I own and sometimes bothers me. I have other reef sandals that feel much better."
239840,0,I recently had foot surgery and was looking for a nice wide plain sneaker. These are really cute but not wide enough. I would order the widest they offer. I will be giving these away and ordering the wider one. I really like them
197043,2,"Having read another review that said these slippers ran small, I ordered the next size up but it was too small. I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger. This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere."
106380,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
162207,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
261588,1,The shipping was fast and the shoe was true to size. Thank you so much! I now have a new favorite pair of shoes :)
186624,1,This is my second pair of Propet Walkers. I love the velcro closures and the support that these walkers provide. I've never washed them but like the idea if I ever needed to.
377663,1,Real smooth sneaker! Make sure you keep them clean though. The dirt is hard to get off if you don't take care.Great color.
340025,1,I got these for my son's 14th birthday. He was so excited he threw them on on the spot. He has worn them about a month now and they are still his favorites.
272448,2,"This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I've ordered. I LOVED the first pair. They were so comfortable, light weight, fit secure on my feet and provided arch support. So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season. I don't know what's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered. The straps were all over the place, some were way too loose, others too snug. They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn, so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund. Have not received yet. I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time. Again, I have had another pair of those, and the new ones were not as comfortable. Foot bed was harder than first pair, straps not uniform as to fit. TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY???"
29266,1,I have bought my second pair after I wore out my first pair. They are lightweight and probably more suited for day hikes and short backpacks rather than extended trips. waterproof and only problem I had was the toe seam started to come unglued and a quick trip to shoe repair and $6 fixed me up. I really like these boots and are the most comfortable hiking boot I have ever owned and I am 63 and have been hiking over 40 years
34253,1,"I love, love, love these shoes! I'm petite and these give plenty of height to my short legs. They go with everything. Super comfy and I actually find it hard NOT to wear them everyday. By far, my favorite pair of shoes!"
546,1,"After having worn these boots for hundreds of miles in several different countries for over a year, I can safely say that they are a great pair of hiking boots for general purposes and I highly recommend them to anyone.Don't look any further."
215749,1,"The customer ratings speak volumes. Yes, this is a comfortable and highly functional shoe. Yet, I had never seen the Propet brand in any shoe store, and that includes several states. I first became aware of this brand on Amazon. thank you, Amazon! This was the first Propet I ordered and since then, have ordered several more. However, I do wish that all the colors in all sizes were available. I would be purchasing more if that becomes the case."
9822,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
372859,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
322121,1,"Always love this one better than other Capezio ballet slippers.The best part is it's true to the size. It's not necessary to buy half size bigger than your normal size as I always do when I buy other dance shoes, such as capezio-Julia."
83949,0,"Straps run a little tight, but the actual sole of the shoe is the right size.."
282048,1,"Excellent ballet shoes. Just remember to buy a size bigger, 'cause they run a bit small. I'm usually a 7 o 7.5, and I had to get an 8."
4242,1,"took these boots backpacking this past weekend and they performed above expectation. waterproofing stood up to mud and stream crossings. After looking at more expensive brands I am more than happy I bought the Hi-Tec Altitude. After 18 miles these boots were still comfortable with no blisters on my feet. Affordable, lightweight,rugged,waterproof comfortable and stylish. If you overlook these you are missing out on a superb value."
353721,1,comfortable and made in the USA!! Danner boots can be recrafted as well when sole is worn out. Great boots.
108615,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
166182,1,"My husband is thrilled with these. He wanted a slipper that he could slip on and not have to tie or finagle and this one meets the bill. His other requirement was that the sole be suitable for outdoors for a quick pop out the door. These have a non-skid sole and he says they're very comfy on the inside too.Please note that the widths are little snug. So if you wear an M width, you may want to go up one."
300527,1,"Thanks a lot!!! Good brand, good shoes, I like it very much! Classic shoes, I recomendate this item to my friends!"
2037,1,"I ordered these and only the very next day the price went down by $20.But aside from that they have been a really good pair of boots.They had them in my size(15) which are hard for me to find.They arrived very quickly I believe within 4 days.Very comfortable,the only bad thing was that the laces only lasted about 2 weeks.I guess because the eyelets are made of metal."
287312,1,"I keep buying these shoes because they are so comfortable and last so long. Whenever a pair finally wears out, I order another pair of the exact same shoe. This is a very good product and they arrived in just three days."
235019,1,These shoes were very nice and just what I was looking for but I had to return them because theydid not fit.
201444,2,"So I ordered these shoes, thinking they would look just like the picture. I was wrong, they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver. I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw. The shoes were not only the color I didn't want, but also HUGE,WIDE & not what I expected. They came in a nice box though, but besides that I would not Buy these. I was so disappointed & I paid $71.00 for these? There's So many shoes out there...that you can BUY for less..& look just as good. I shouldn't' have paid this much for these shoes.."
80597,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
37168,1,"They are the one pair of shoes you can't go wrong with. Wear them with shorts or jeans, always looks great!"
364662,1,I'm a huge sneaker freak and have to say these shoes are some of my favorites. Comfortable and stylish they look great with my 511 skinny leg jeans. I will always keep a pair of these in my collection.
169947,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
389102,1,They looked great when i got them and are still holding up good. This coming from someone that wears out shoes like no other. haha
198400,1,came in time my son loved it and excellent quality and true to size i would buy more for him in a different color
329527,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
112088,1,"I loved them!!! I bought these shoes for a friend to paint, and they were the perfect canvas! Not only are they cute now, but they're also comfortable !"
257485,0,"It took me a month to be able to wear these shoes comfortably. the rubber/plastic is not easily moldable and I got many blisters, etc. I didn't give up, used lots of bandaids and they are now comfortable. I wear them every day and they are great around the water, but I prefer my regular leather Birkenstocks for comfort."
136427,1,"These all black Chuck's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online. They shipped in a timely fashion. Great Kicks, good deal."
282368,0,"Low stars because I never got to them try out. Bought the desert boot ankle high a little before. Oxford length was ok, but wrap around top of foot was way tight. Might try a 1/2 size larger on these. The desert boot ran a full size below just like another reviewer mentioned. I'd go 1/2 size below normal size on the oxford."
156518,1,"This shoe looks great, feels great and you cannot beat the price. All my friends just love them! Looking for another pair!"
79575,1,Fast shipping. Thank You!! I bought these for my son. I may buy a 2nd pair. He normally wears a size 14 but in these I bought a 13 and they fit fine. He loves them.
316711,1,Great Basketball Shoes. My son who is 50 years old has worn these for many years and will not wear any other shoe Goes to show age doesn't matter.
257568,1,"This is the first bike shoe that ever fit me well. My normal shoe size is 14EEEE, and the size 50 Mega Dominator fits me perfectly!I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but as far as I can tell, it's a great all-around bike shoe. The fit provided by the two velcro straps are greatly enhanced by the third strap mechanism.Great service too. The clasping mechanism on one of my shoes broke off. I went to the local bike shop where I had bought the shoes; they ordered the replacement part from Sidi, and in just a few days, I had a very easy-to-install replacement mechanism free of charge!"
98889,1,I needed new shoes and was looking at having to spend $300 + because I needed arch support. These are working well and look good enough to wear to the office. They arrived quickly too.
17359,1,these are the only sneakers that do not hurt arthritic bunions...VERY highly recommend.No hard canvas or leather...nylon that comforms to feet...extremely comfortable... I wear an 8.5 shoe but size 9 in this sneaker
334676,1,My son loves these shoes. He says it's like walking on a cloud. They run big so order a half size smaller. Casual enough for everyday but can be dressed up for nice events.
225113,1,"I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. The color is vibrant and full of life! Also, converse are great shoes."
89220,1,Although this product came marked Birko it is the same as the original Birkenstocks I have had in the past. It is the same fine product.
228002,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
15584,1,I'm very satisfied with this order! Great shoes and got here in 2 days like it said they would. Would recommend to others!
319717,0,"bought these for work because I stand all night( I bartend) on concrete. I have Plantar Fasciitis and these are barely ok. There are much better shoes out there. I wish I could return them. oh well - there are better shoes at being ""The Body Shoe"" I'm surte. all)"
210971,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
314871,1,"My husband wears these as his work boots in the kitchen, we had to add some insoles for more comfort but they are holding up well and he really likes them"
252801,0,"Okay--A little plastic looking, I have faux leather boots by other brands and they don't look quite so plastic. Otherwise comfortable."
40321,1,I bought the reefs for my daughter and she loves them and says they are very comfortable.
232311,1,I have a 3 year old who is hard on shoes. These are good inexpensive boots that last a while . Its definitely worth the money
32665,1,"Arrived in good condition. My daughter is a size 6 1/2-7, so I ordered these in size 8.5. This was the smallest size available at the time, and after reading other reviews thought it would be smart to order larger in case they fit small and hard to put on. I would say the size is pretty true to fit. The 8.5 were pretty big for my 2/12 year old. She isn't wearing them much since they are a little too big in size, and they go high up in the leg so it's hard for her to walk. I had a hard time finding a pair online that were pink, not too high, and would ship to Canada. Overall, the product meets the description expectations, I just wish I found ones that went mid calf and would ship to Canada."
175677,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
160126,1,"Came perfect without any problems, they were the size I ordered and everything was exactly how it was suppose to be. I bought them for my girlfriend and she loves them!"
49537,1,"Great comfort and quality. I've had this shoe for a few months now. First time I tried it on I noticed a serious improvement in my enjoyment and energy for the run. Great cushioning, although this is a very light shoe --- fit for racing, not for training."
249173,1,"Excellent quality, extremely comfortable slipper. Please purchase atleast one size bigger then your normal size. I wear a size 9, but purchased a size 10. Thank goodness I did because they fit like a glove. Other then that a great slipper."
179586,1,"The shoes are great, and the shipping time was reasonable, as was the price. A warning: not all types can be shipped to Canada, which is frustrating to find out just as you're finishing up an order."
174677,1,"MRS BOWLES WAS ""VERY PLEASED "" WITH THE PRODUCT, THE SPEED OF DEV., AND THE ACCURACY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS.WE FELT LIKE WE ""WERE FAVORITE CUSTOMERS""...."
234586,1,The most adorable baby shoes. They're easy to get on and off and hold up pretty well to a newly walking toddler.
247983,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
248140,1,"I started wearing these shoes when I was 19. Five years later, I've gone through two pairs (about to buy my third), but they've been my one and only pair of shoes. I just haven't had the desire to wear anything else. I've worn them for nearly 12 hours a day, every single day, year-round, working at a job during the day that requires constant movement, and then walking around the city at night. You can't really tell by looking at them that they've been literally everywhere with me. They could use a bit of a polish, but other than that, nothing's worn down. I suppose if I wore more shoes, I would only need one pair of these, and they'd last longer. But thats not stopping me."
99956,1,"I have made these shoes my summer shoes the last 5 years, one pair white, one pair brown. Love this since I can just slip them on and go. Good enough for my work and great for casual. And they hold up well!! When they get too wore for everyday they become yard shoes. And the best part is I don't need to wear socks!!"
355909,0,After wearing these shoes for a couple of weeks I think they are descent.They felt a little low around the ankle at first but I dont notice that any more. Soles are very quiet and have good flex. I walk a lot and find that the inserts dont have great cushion but may be alright for others.
203165,1,"I love these shoes. They can be worn for many occasions. If you get them dirty, no problem, just throw them in the washing machine and let them air dry. They come out just like new, every time."
24255,1,"These boots are perfect. I was looking for black boots, with little to no heel, light weight, knee high, lace up with a buckle and reasonable price. It arrived early with a few minor scuffs but not noticeable when I put them on. I wear a size 6 and ordered the boots in a size 6 and they are a perfect fit. The laces make it so it is adjustable so it fits my calves well. They are soooo surprisingly light weight!! It makes them very comfortable and easy to wear. Great boots for a good price. I am very happy with them."
20258,0,"Just a shoe, for all the ratings and hoopla and price. I expected more.They really look good. They don't feel bad. I just thought they would provide more cushion and support like a sneaker."
11060,1,"Absolutely beautiful boot and can't wait to wear them. We don't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can. Sorry I can't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport, I doubt I will be disappointed."
12849,1,The butterfly is so cute! It's nice to have something distinguishing without having to get a crazy color. I use these shoes for powerlifting as well as everyday wear. I visited the seller's website and they have a pretty large variety of designs. Would like to see some in kids' sizes but I couldn't be happier with my new Chucks!
274623,0,The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller.
123297,0,"This is a good looking shoe. But they are narrow. I was surprised because I have bought many pairs in the past and never had this problem. The bad thing is I bought 3 pair and all of them are them same, narrow. I wish now I had bought a 1/2 size bigger."
204898,1,"I think this is the best shoe dryer out there. We have a great competing company based out here in the west, but theirs is plastic and doesn't look a nice."
9554,1,My friend recommended this to me. I love them! I wear them almost everyday! I stand and work on concret most of the day. They are wonderful!! I will buy more!
274855,1,"Excellent hiking or everyday boot.Extremely good value and fit.Hardly any ""breakin"" required.I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in a hard wearing boot,for the money."
373555,1,Received these today and put them on right away. All I can say is my feet are in heaven! If you want a quality house shoe look no further. These are so comfortable I'm sighing with contentment.
111623,1,These shoes are very narrow so it is important that you as the consumer buy a whole size bigger if you are interested. Other wise they are comfortable and stylish.
178733,1,"This pair of converse was just what I expected; they were one my son's Christmas presents. The colors available were more varied than those I'd seen in local stores and the price was better. This item arrived sooner than promised, too. Needless to say, my son was pleased."
23573,1,"Alone. On the streets of Playa, searching for size 5 Pampers, I longed for refreshment and inspiration. Spotting a corner bodega, I determined that a cervaza was the only remedy. After making my purchase and setting out renewed on my mission, I realized my fatal error. The cap did not twist off. Distraught, I accepted it was not meant to be...it was then that I remembered the hidden church key in the bottom of my Fanning Sandals (Men Sizes 4-15). My mission and my faith were saved."
186003,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
132868,1,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these boots! They are absolutely the most comfy boots I've ever owned! Cute AND perfect for tromping around the hills on the farm. I had a perfect pair of boots back when I was about 12 or 13 -- loved them like crazy and wore them til they fell apart. No boots have ever compared -- 'til now!! Thank you Ariat. These have quickly become my daily go-to shoes. In fact, the last three days, I have planned my outfits so I could wear the boots! :)"
83444,1,"I love these so much. When my last pair died, I bought them here. When that pair dies, I'll buy more. I hope they never stop making them."
338559,1,Great purchase! Great service! Great delivery! my boyfriend was very happy with his present. Thank you for making it so easy
2326,2,"I have owned these boots for several years now. They fit well, are quite comfortable, and seem watertight. However, about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica. We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall. The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots. Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems. I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping, especially if there is moss. Thus, I discounted the warning. Later, at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones. I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks. I had never experienced anything so slick. The others in my party did not have the same problems. I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers, but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes. I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot, which did not pose the same problem of slipping. One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet. Ironically, even though these boots seem to be waterproof, you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick. They seem to work fine on rough ground, even when wet. Finally, after wearing these boots for several seasons (primarily when I am outside in snow and slush), they have developed some very annoying squeaks. So, it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise. Otherwise, these boots have been fine."
305431,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
87246,1,I bought the Eurelle Slippers for my husband's birthday. They arrived quicker than I expected. He loves them and wears them every day.
369968,1,"My wife says it's a very comfortable shoe but a bad color, and she asked why they don't make it in classic white. She also asked why Reebok doesn't make more women's shoes in a size 10.5, which is large enough to accommodate her orthotics as well as socks. Reebok has been her favorite manufacturer for years and she's sorry to have to start buying from others now that she has to buy a larger size than in the past. All in all, however, she says they fit very well, are light enough and are a great product for a very reasonable price."
54123,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
295570,1,I have several pairs of these and have poor balance and a bum foot. This allows me to walk my dog in the park on days I would never have before. All of the dog walkers and others would not be without them. We all have them. I just bought a pair for a friend who has had back surgery and has to be careful not to slip and fall. These really work!
382980,1,"These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They are great for work and I do lots of walking every day. Slip on is practical and stylish. Wish they came in brown also, but Amazon only had black. After 1 year the soles are wearing down so I just ordered a new pair to replace them. Uppers still look great though."
233459,0,i loved my old ipaths. i used to get a leather aligator designed black ipaths that dont exist anymore? i got them mainly for the pockets and i thoughts all or most had them and yet these dont? im kinda disapointed cause i have other shoes but i guess an extra pair. they look nice tho but NO POCKETS!!!
146186,1,"Boots great, arrived timeley and price was as good as found anywhere. I will buy here agaion in the future."
111126,1,"These are great light weight boots. They keep your feet warm, but not hot. I wear them ever day, and they required no break in period and were quite comfortable right out of the box. One word of advice...these boots are sized smaller than I expected. If you wear a size 10, I would consider ordering a size 11. Other than that, they're just what the Dr. ordered."
264084,1,"I really like these shoes. I've been wearing store brand knock-offs for ages and I finally got a pair of proper all-stars and I'm so freakin' happy. They're more flexible and comfortable than I expected and I'd say these are comfortable enough to jog in - if I every jogged :P. But yeah, great shoes, and for this price they're totally worth it.I feel like Dwight from Sin City when I wear these xD."
229172,1,"They're Chucks, what more needs to be said. There is a reason they are still around after all these years."
296449,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
243214,1,"Already have Chucks in white, which I wore for the b-ball team in high school...yeah, when Chucks were the shoes to be wearin'!! Decided to re-live days of Sandlot Black PF Flyers with the magic wedge, make you run faster, jump higher! But when I got them, they were about a 1/3 size too small and the shoes felt uneven (one bigger than the other, both still tight). Thought I could wear them in and couldn't. Chalked up to a loss. Paid less for black Chucks and they fit true to size! Love these black Chucks! GREAT PURCHASE!!Wonder what the difference is in the monochrome black. Anyone know?"
214455,1,"After much research I found the (Campus) Frye Boots I wanted on Amazon. I did a lot of price checking and found the boots for $236.00 instead of $299.00. What a great deal! I was a little hesitant not being able to try the boots on before I purchased them but when they arrived and I tried them on they fit like a charm! Super comfortable and of course wonderful Frye quaility.I have purchased many items off Amazon and have been very satisfied with all.And, I saved a good deal of money for the same boots Nordstrom's sell for $299.00. I call that SMART shopping!!"
60399,1,"The Hi-Tec Men's Altitude waterproof hiker has out performed more expense boots I have owned. With the December snow storm in the east,it was a great test. I gave my old Hi-Tec hikers to my son because he liked them so much. That's why I purchase another pair."
3135,1,"I bought these boots to replace my three year old boots that I had bought to replace my summer weight non waterproof boots that I still have and use if I know water won't be involved. All the boots I have bought in the last 5 years have been Hi-Tec. They fit and feel like a sneaker once you get them broken in. I am in the process of breaking these new ones in, it has only been two days so they are still a little stiff. I figure that by next week I will be good to go in these. I use these for work, daily wear, hiking, walking, walking in rain, steeping in streams, walking in snow, mowing the lawn, using the snowblower, snowshoeing, and they work great with my yak-trax when I walk on ice. The only reason I replaced my old ones is because they were starting to leak water when I submerged them for more than a few seconds. Great boots, I don't regret any pair of Hi-Hec's I ever bought.1/23/12 UPDATE! I am now on pair number 4 of these boots and I will say that while these are every bit as good at protecting my foot as every pair of Hi-Tec boots I have owned there was a down side this time. It has taken over two weeks of daily wear to get these broken in, and they still need a little more work. Mostly they are tight in the ankle area but softening. I really like the boots, but over two weeks to break in is a little much."
157773,1,"What else can I say? Converse's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades. They are comfortable, fun and in my case, red. I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own. Love them."
257892,1,"These shoes were a Xmas present for my daughter. Even though she did pick them out, you always wonder how well they will be liked. She said that she wore them all night long and truely loved them. I am thinking about another pair for her."
313107,0,"The rubber sole is cheap and rubs off on hardwood/ceramic flooring. The shoe does not breathe at all, I often have to take off the shoes so that my feet can get some air. The quality of the material seems rather low. Definitely not leather. Comfortable shoes though, look good, and provide very decent first support for my foot arch. Took me about a week for my feet to get used to the shoes, but now they're perfect."
194803,1,Wonderful pair of shoes...I wore them to work today and it was just like they were my old friend. I would highly recommend Clark shoes to EVERYONE
337175,1,I'm on my feet for about 6 hours a day and love these boots. I'm on my second pair and have been very happy with both.
86968,1,Sent these to my daughter in law in Calif I live in Indiana very convient. She let me know what size and color also sent her a picture and a birthday message Very nice. very happy very very satisified
86448,0,"These shoes are not bad, but not great either. I bought them because I needed something to wear around the house and the price was right. They look cute - although the toes are a little too pointy for my taste - and the colors are pretty. They fit well. However, the rubber soles on these shoes squeak horribly on my wood floors with every step! I wouldn't buy these again for this reason."
4711,1,"The bag is great quality. It's just as cute in person. If it gets dirty, I can empty it and throw it in the wash. The inside has two pockets on one side (great for keys and my phone) and a zippered pocket on the other side. I originally bought this to carry in addition to my smaller Bungalow360 bag for notebooks. It does fit my 3 ring binder in it quite well.If you are looking for a cute bag for school or day to day, this is it!"
215356,1,"I've been riding with this pair of shoes for about a month now and I have nothing but good things to say. They are stiff, light, comfortable, and breathable (which is a great thing if you are going to ride in say California, but not so much fun during the winter in Boston). The Velcro straps are very secure and keep the shoe on tight for the entire ride. I've taken the shoes out on trails numerous times and they still look like new - great durable material. I've tried them with the Time ATAC pedals and the Shimano m540 pedals. As you would expect, both worked great as well. If you're looking for a good shoe that will last, I'd recommend this one."
261628,1,"This is the second Converse Low Top I bought this week because of sizing error(my fault). I ordered a size 10 in Mens the first time because I'm a legit size 10.5 Mens in every other shoe I wear. The shoes were received quickly by mail and the quality is great. When I tried them on, I had a good amount of space inside the shoes to move my toes which was too much for me. These size 9.5 shoes are a perfect fit. The sellers advice is spot on about sizing. Order 1 size down from your usual shoe size if you want a good fit. Other than that, these shoes are great for casual walking and weight training. I use them for dead lifting and squatting. Definitely recommend these shoes to anyone!"
353870,1,My son loves the boots. Seem to keep his feet dry even on rainy and snowy days. These are durable all-purpose boots.
112028,1,"I love this shoe because it is dressy, classy and comfortable...and a flat. I search extensively for the shoe with the proper look to wear with my suits. This shoe is it!! In addition to coming in various colors -- it comes with a patent tip/heel. And did I say comfortable? There is no traditional break-in period. The shoe just molds itself to your foot (soft leather). A must have."
347283,1,"These shoes fit me just fine. Of course I had to buy it one size down which is typical for converse shoes, but otherwise I have nothing to complain about."
11690,1,"I switched out my military issue jump boots for a pair of these Bate's zip-sided Enforcers. The construction is solid, and the cushioning is greatly superior to that in a standard issue military boots. If you've never worn boots with a zipper, I highly recommend them. The zipper makes getting out the door much easier. I do not know whether or not I would deploy without a backup pair of boots. If the zipper were to fail on these (in a deployed environment), you'd have a heck of a time keeping them on your feet. For stateside use (e.g. everyday Police use), they are a great boot."
155577,1,"LAST CHRISTMAS I ORDERED THIS BOOT AND NOW THIS YEAR THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED. I AM WISHING THAT I HAD ORDERED MORE THAN ONE PAIR. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER PAIR THIS YEAR. I LIKE THE SOLES AND HEELS ON THIS BOOT BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER THAN MOST AND THIS IS THE FINEST LOOKING DRESS BOOT MADE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IT IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT THAT I HAVE FOUND. YOU WILL GET SOME RESPECT WHEN YOU ARE SEEN IN THESE BOOTS. THESE BOOTS ARE ""BOSS"" TO SAY THE LEAST."
175613,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
114749,1,"I've never been much of one for fancy shoes. Sure, I love the way they look, but I end up wearing them once, then stowing them to the ever-growing stash in the bottom of my closet.When I bought this shoe in the blushing bride/heather color last fall from a catalog, I expected another candidate for that stack in my closet. A shoe with the playful, sporty, yet somehow feminine details of this one simply isn't practical...right?Then they came and I tried them on.I hate to admit it, but I am now a Puma athletic shoe addict. Every pair is sporty and trendy, yet has a classical styling that is somehow sophisticated and traditional. They work for me because they're pracitcal enough to go running in, but stylish enough to wear with jeans or a sporty minidress.There's not much else to say. These are the most comfortable cute shoes I've ever had, plain and simple. They are, by far, the most versatile shoes I've ever owned. BUY THEM!"
161737,1,"The first day I had the money clip it seemed rather weak, but once I stretch out the fold and broke it in - it is awesome! I have receipts, notes business cards as well as cash and have no concerns - this is a deal."
93763,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
322405,0,"Size run's a little big, but we were able to put up with it in regardless. So we kept them."
146979,1,i love them they are so comfortable. i wish i had ordered another color. the best boot ever bought. great
199980,0,"This is a ugly indoor soccer shoe but it works. It is great for just messing around but not for playing an actual game. It is good for side kicks but that is about it, there r more problems with it than good things. It is horrible for juggling because the laces r not covered an it is not flat on top. It is horrible for running because it is stiff and the leather is really thick. It makes ur foot sweat really eaisily and it is not comfortable at all. They r really heavy too so it is hard to run. The only good things is it lasts a long time it has good grip. These shoes r good for just messing around or just wearing but horrible for games. I would save ur money for something better and it could be cheaper than this too."
124255,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
52199,0,"Cute little pair of flip flops, but offer little to no support. I found them very uncomfortable and returned them."
99320,1,These are the only shoes my husband has found that are wide enough and comfortable for him to wear to work all day. We searched everywhere for them and found them here. He is wearing his old ones as long as possible since they seem to be hard to find!
113311,2,"These shoes were counterfit. I own a real pair of these shoes.The interior lining was different, the impression on the bottom of the sole was different and the top of the shoe was not reinforced with extra canvas to give them dimensional stability. The elastic on the side of the shoe was not up to the quality of the real shoes. I guess you need to question a $30.00 difference in price and I should have known what to expect.I returned them and was reimbursed the money from Amazon."
48481,1,I bought these shoes because they were super cute! When I got them I was sad to see they were soft soles because I was dumb and didn't read the title correctly. I decided however to bypass the whole returning thing and wear them outside the house anyway (what a rebel!). And here I am a year later and could not be happier! They have lasted me without even the hint of a hole which I have yet to be so lucky with any other shoe I have owned! These are possibly some of the best shoes ever! If you are even slightly considering buying them just do it!
255133,1,"I've bought two pairs of the Clarks Desert Boots from Amazon. One Dark Brown and the other the original Tan.I'm very happy with the purchase and with the boots. The fit perfect and bring back fond memories of the 60's, when I wore them for YEARS. They are as comfortable as I remember.They bring a smile to my face when I look down at my feet. A very fond smile.If I had to fault them.....it would be that they are manufactored in Vietnam. Being a Vietnam Veteran I ""wish"" they were manufactored elsewhere."
16689,1,"These shoes are consistent - great fit, no break-in time, and decent wear. This is the third time I've purchased them and have had no problems."
214655,1,I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WEAR REGULAR ATHLETIC SHOES UNTIL NOW WITHOUT GETTING BLISTERS. THESE SHOES REALLY SUPPORT YOUR FEET AND THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE TO WALK IN.
376929,0,"I love these for keeping baby's feet warm - but they are not practical for playing in the snow or walking on wet surfaces. The soft soles do not keep feet dry.The main reason I got Robeez shoes was that they were harder for my daughter to kick off. They are great for that purpose, and for those shaky first steps. I'll still buy the shoes, but I probably won't buy the booties again except for non-ambulatory babies in winter."
63390,1,"these shoes are jst simply phenomenal. the way they feel on your feet are jst great. so comfortable, durable, and good looking.i would definately recommend these shoes ot anyone who adores bowling."
186323,0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."
184321,1,"comfy, and durable.. great for running around. really like the soft pliable suede.gray if warm. but fashionable, really nice shoe"
225835,1,Bought these for Christmas for my 13 year old daughter and they were a huge hit.
171082,1,"This is a warm and beautiful boot at a great sale price, but the fit is too snug on the top of the foot just under the ankle strap. The leg part of the boot aroung the ankle strap is cut narrowly; thus, even with thin socks and the buckle unfastened on the ankle strap, the fit on the top of my foot was too tight. Lesson learned: Buy shoes/boots ONLY after trying them on first no matter how beautiful and well-priced."
48205,1,"We weren't sure what size to get, and they are a little big. However, my son is only 11 and still growing, so we intentionally bought big. Overall very happy."
359964,1,After I got the right size these where the most comfortable dress shoes. I don't dance I just wanted a pair of dress shoe that I could actually walk in. I had to get a whole size larger then my normal tennis shoes. I normally where a 9 But I had to get a 10. I first got a 9.5 but they were just a bit to small. Unfortunately the company has a restocking fee which make sending them back cost almost as much as the shoes. So do yourself a favor and get a whole size larger.
158427,1,this is the best shoe I have ever bought. I love them and will never go back to pumas or addiadas ever!
12530,1,Thank you for sending this fast and correct! These are my daughter's favorite shoes and when her old pair finally got holes in the soles she put these on her Birthday list. She unwrapped them and immediately they were on her feet!
331007,0,"I got this on sale for a really good price. I have always been a fan of Adidas shoes but I thought I gave Converse a try for the good price. Currently, I also wear Adidas Team MAC 2, which I bought for a few dollars more than the Converse. The Team MAC 2 defnitely has much better feel and support, especially when landing after a jump. I have worn Nike, Reebok and other brands of basketball shoes of about the same price and the support provided by the Converse is only average. For example, the tongue of the Converse is thin while the Adidas is breathable mesh and much thicker. I feel like I am wearing a cheap, store brand basketball shoes with the Converse. Don't let the ICON system fool you, it doesn't do anything special and is no comparison to Adidas's AdiPRENE+, Torsion System and A3 Structure. In my opinion, Adidas has the best fit, feel and support for about the same price. I currently own 4 pairs of basketball shoes and one pair of running shoes. All are Adidas with A3 or AdiPRENE+. All are remarkably comfortable. I know, but they were all on sale for very low prices. So I stocked up."
2627,1,"These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
358761,1,"I have never gotten a pair of character shoes before, so I thought they were going to be sooo uncomfortable and hard to dance in like regular high heeled shoes. They were sooo comfortable. I wore them out first and my feet were not in dire pain when I got home. Instead of half a size difference from my street shoe I got a whole size difference, which worked well. They are comfortable and easy to dance in. I definitely recommend them for a short dance for a beginner."
19488,1,"Comfortable, easy care and great for traveling. I have several pair and recommend them to all of my friends. Love the color selection and thrilled that they can be washed."
75284,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
332566,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."
145136,1,Have two daughters and both have a this boot. Is well made stylish and holds up to wear and tear. Older daughter has had hers almost 2 years and still fashionable and little wear.
164457,1,"I have had several pair of these in the last 25 years or so. These are so comfy, no break in time required. I'd like to see more fashion colors, though. I'd love to have pairs in turquoise, bright yellow, orange, kelly green, hot pink, etc. I wear these with slacks and tailored skirts, even certain dresses. They are very soft and comfy, durable, and make your foot look very small. I can't recommend them strongly enough to anyone who needs to be on thier feet a great deal, or who has foot problems, or who simply wants a sturdy-but-stylish walking shoe."
142856,1,This is the third pair that I have purchased.Drew is a great company and their shoes are the best that I have ever had.
101262,1,This is my 3rd pair of Modi's they are soo comfortable and I think stylish. I would normally have given a 5 star rating but this particular pair is a little smaller then previous purchases of the same size.
305927,1,"A classic wedge, good value. only complaint- sole should be wider for a wider foot. The leather upper fits well, but you feel like you are balancing on a standard medium width wedge. Comfortable shoe for work/walking."
388178,1,"I love all the sexy and high-heeled shoes out there, but as we age, they are not as suitable as when we were young (and even then probably not). This style of Naot is somewhat magical - I've had many compliments, such as, they look like ballerina shoes, funky, stylish, classy, versatile - can wear them with pants or skirts. They've become my signature shoe - I have two pair in different colours. I can walk for miles in these shoes, they are that comfortable. I highly recommend them."
155148,1,"My son seems to like these, but I don't know if they are worth the amount I paid for them. They are made somewhat like those cheap shower flip flops. I'm afraid the strap will come loose and tear through from the bottom of the flip flops. They do bend easily though and are comfortable. I don't think that if I had seen these in the store, I would of purchased them."
272655,1,"If you have narrow feet that don't fit regular thongs very well, this could be the flip flop for you. Though these are slightly different from typical flops, they are close enough. They have more than the single strap on each side of your foot, which I think makes them look nicer. What's more important is that they fit better.This is my second pair. The first pair died at the hands or should I say teeth of a puppy. lol Now that she's older I think this pair is safe. I sure hope so because I love these so much. Just the perfect go to shoe for summer."
199596,1,"I have this walking sandal in white and tan, as well as the black ones I recently purchased from Amazon.com. They fit great and are very comfortable for all day wear. I wear a size 13 N, and it's difficult to find shoes, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon.com. Another plus was Amazon's price was much less than where I'd purchased the other two pair."
371502,1,"Right off the bat. These shoe's are as light as a feather and perfect for what I bought them for.. Parkour. Although they may have been made for 'Tia Chi', they make excellent shoes for Parkour and Free Running. They are light, grip really well, and have a thin sole that allows you to really 'feel the ground'..... However, if you plan on getting these shoes there's something you should know about the sizing. I was very confused and scared about ordering a size 11 when I range from 10.5-11.5..... I figured I'd be safe ordering in the middle, but I should've gone with 10.5. They still fit perfectly fine, but I have some toe room. Which I didn't really want. So I was extremely angry at shoe companies for being so inconsistent with sizing, 10.5 converse, 11 Vans, 11.5 in a lot of other shoes. These shoe sizes would most compare closest to Converse. So If you own a pair of chuck taylors, then use that shoe size as a guide. I wish more people on Amazon clarified the sizing. Either way, a little toe room or not, I'm still able to do what I want in these shoes and happily. You get a pair of these, you'll feel as agile as Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill trilogy."
226700,1,Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Plaid Hi SneakerGreat shoes at a great price! My daughter loves them :)
367035,1,I love the design it is unique. It a must have for soccer players this boots are well made and you must get one.
374725,1,"They were good shoes. I love Adidas but they shoes were not to comfortable. I might have thought and should of thought about it twice before I purchased them, but good in style and very light."
267561,1,"I'M A RETURNING USER OF THIS PRODUCT, HAVE WORN THIS BRAND, AND STYLE OF HI-TEC HIKING BOOT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE SHOE IS BOTH LONG WEARING, WITH ANKLE SUPPORT. I WORK OUTDOORS, IN WINTER WEATHER, SUMMER HEAT, AND RAIN. GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. WILL BUY AGAIN. CHARLIE W."
22298,1,"I grew up wearing Clarks shoes. And had forgotten how comfortable they actually are. Well, i received my shoes today, put them on, and was immediately reminded. These shoes are terrific! Amazon should have a category for people who are thoroughly satisfied with any given product. For anyone looking for total comfortability and style, you cannot (repeat, CANNOT!) go wrong with these shoes. I was so satisfied, i purchased another pair (different kind though). Amazon gets props for such a speedy delivery.Tarikh Bandele."
171364,1,These shoes are comfortable and keep my feet and legs from aching on the days I stand and walk on concrete floors all day long. Great shoe!
290466,1,"These are the most comfortable walking shoes going. I have had many pairs over the years and love every one. However, occasionally some sales clerk will convince me that they have something better. I buy...I'm sorry and then I get another pair of Prowalkers. They are light and you can wear them forever without that tight heavy feeling that so many ""walking"" shoes get."
132332,1,These fit my daughter perfectly! I recommend these! Nice flexible leather on the outside and soft flowery print inside. True to size.
157570,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
252571,1,"I always wore birk's, but a friend told me about crocs and I have worn nothing else. The help my feet and my low back problems."
371665,1,"Shoes are great. 15 minutes after I ordered the shoes (literally) they went on sale, $5 less. I could not change my order. I would have to wait until I received them then return them. Disappointed."
318704,1,It took a long time to find the best walking shoe. This is it. You put them on and there is no breaking them in. Comfortable from the first step. Highly recommend!
268708,1,"These are some good quality slip-ons, I've had for about 5-6 months now and they have been great for me. When you first get them you might be skeptical but give them a try like I did and they'll probably end up being something you want to wear almost every day. Style matches the ""dress casual"" look I'm always trying to achieve.Fit is good, leather is good quality and holds a decent polish but doesn't scuff that easily easily. The shoe is comfortable without any fancy insoles or sole, lightweight and just flexible enough when you're on your feet a fair amount. I even wore them one time while I was moving some boxes for about 3-4 hours because I accidentally forgot to bring a change of sneakers with me. This was after wearing them the entire day at work.Pretty good deal even though they're made in China. Definitely more comfortable than the squared toe lace-ups with hard soles from Nordstrom Rack I had been wearing and quality is about the same. They take a while to break in for some reason, but once you do they will feel like you've had them all along and the cushioned sole, while not impressive to look at when you first see them, is ideal. I expect to get at least 2 years out of them as I do with almost all shoes I've owned (with some light care), even through wearing them at least 3x a week."
388436,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
330349,1,These shoes are comfortable and require almost no breakin period. They are a good value for the money and i would buy them again
305491,2,What a disapointment. Bought them a few times in the past. The only thing that hasn't changed is the look and name. They are a total misfit and give no support. I guess Rockport doesn't care what it sells.
371318,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
20117,1,"I previously gave these shoes 5 stars but now have to take back 1. There seems to be a re-design of the tongue and it had been a quite-painful break-in period. The tongue corners poked into my ankles for about 2 weeks. I would pull the tongues up and they stopped hurting but only for a few steps, then they were back to in-pain-position. It took over a week for the corners to soften up enough that they weren't so irritating; another week and the shoes were comfortable. I've gone through 4 or 5 pairs of these shoes over the years, these were the first to hurt; previous pairs took only a 1-day break-in period. I had sworn these shoes off during those painful break-in days but now would buy them again, but will do something to soften up those tongue corners."
346201,1,"I enjoy them every time I wear them. Comfortable, sporty and hip enough so that my daughter's friends actually listen to me."
151620,1,"These shoes fit!I wear a 10.5, I bought a 10.5, and I can honestly say that I've never worn a pair of shoes that fit this perfectly, just like a 10.5 should. From the heel to the toe, adidas has managed to craft a shoe that not only fits, but supports and protects my feet like no other.I've had these shoes for over three months now; I've run hundreds of miles in them, worked out regularly, and occasionally just worn them around town/base. They've aged on the outside like any shoe would, but where the quality of these kicks really shines is the durability of the support and megabounce system. Usually, with what I put shoes through, I'd expect very little from them at this point in their life, but these have really impressed. On a 10 point scale, they're still performing at an 8+.The bottom line: I'm an expert wearer of shoes, and these are the best shoes I've ever worn. Very much worth the price."
32350,1,"Here are the detailed features from the shoe manufacturer:1. The pinnacle high mileage-training shoe that yields the ultimate blend of cushioning and stability through ASICS proprietary I.G.S. technology.2. Impact Guidance System (I.G.S.) combines all ASICS components to direct the foot from heel-to-toe, allowing a more natural gait.3. Lateral rearfoot flex grooves provide rearfoot shock attenuation at initial impact.4. Full-Length SpEVA midsole material for increased shock attenuation and midsole durability.5. Two density trusstic links the rearfoot and forefoot and maintains midfoot support.6. GEL Cushioning System provides maximum rearfoot and forefoot shock attenuation.I have been using these shoes for several months now and here are my feelings toward the shoe:1. Little bit narrower and smaller than the size and width of the show suggest. So always buy a bit larger. I have a slight wider feet so I chose the 2E size and it fits great.2. Cushing is good even though the shoe is mainly for stability (many stability running shoe has the problem of stiffness in the heel area).3. The front part of shoe (inside area) press slight against the feet when running so if this is the first time you use this kind of shoe (I used Asics 990 before) this may take sometime for your feet to breakin for the slightly uncomfortable feeling initially (after several running sessions, the feeling should be ok).4. Very good ventilation at the front part. Your feet won't overheat.5. Don't buy at 100$ price range. I bought it at Zappos, which has sale on this item (you need to find out your exact size since your size may be sold out) and I got them for around 50$. This is a great price for such great shoes."
207017,1,"Pretty to look at and wonderful to wear. No worries here about cold feet and feels luxurious. You ask, what would I need these in Hawaii for? We have snow here too! I would recommend these to anyone who wants it all, warm, comfortable and good looks."
11252,1,"i like this type of shoes, i'm very glad that i bought this pair, i wear this shoes, and i'm lucky ))"
258666,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
189499,1,"I find this pair of Reebok running shoes to be of excellent quality. They are very comfortable and cushion the shock of walking. I am past the running age, so I need a good foundation and arch support. The price was right also. Reebok is the best name in sport shoes in my estimation. Thank you. I hope this helps."
337689,1,I looove these shoes. They are supper comfy and match with pretty much anything. You can get cheaper rip off ones at target or payless but they have ugly childish disgnes on them and get damaged allot easier.
225778,1,"i ordered the traditional black converse just three days ago and i just got them in the mail today! they came in my mailbox, from usps, and had the slim converse box. the shoes were in perfect condition and were the correct size and color that i ordered. very great service and impecable shipping speed. i definently will buy from this seller again and i highly recommend shopping with this seller! :)"
261610,1,Was bought as a Christmas Gift. He enjoys them because of the material your feet can breathe much better.
308562,0,"I've ordered another style of Easy Spirit walking shoes and loved those as they fit great and need no breaking in period.... I love it when I can wear a shoe straight out of the box with no problems.This time around I decided to give the Easy Spirit Jumper style a try due the deep discounted price and good reviews. The Easy Spirit Jumper walking shoes took time to break in and were tight feeling across the top of my feet at first. I have a high arch, so this may have been why I experienced the tightness when I fist began wearing them.Also, the Easy Spirit Jumper looks a bit fuddy-duddy and not very stylish looking, but for the price I decided to keep them."
246213,1,I purchased these shoes for my mom for my upcoming wedding and she just loves them. She says they are very comfortable and will have love use of them in the future. They are well constructed and have a very good width to them. i would purchase them myself and would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality and comfortable shoe.
85134,1,"I just purchased my third pair of Bonnie Lites and own wine, black and taupe. I have knee problems and a hard insole really hurts my knees. The Bonnie Lites are well padded and like walking on pillows. Stylish and comfortable!"
245113,0,Stylish design. Light Weight. Steeltoes bend awkwardly. It's true; you get what you pay for.
41828,1,"My son is on his feet from the time he gets to work until he clocks out. He crosses multiple surfaces so a shoe with good traction is a must have. He also has a very wide foot so finding all the above can be difficult.I've been a fan of Skechers since I bought my first pair five years ago. When I suggested he try this brand, though hesitant, he found them in the wide width he needed, dark, as required by work. He was sold on them the day he came home bragging about how for the first time in how long, he can't remember, his feet did not hurt him. It's now three months later and this is what he's asking for us to get him for Christmas. I've always found Sketchers a well made shoe with unique styles and good soles for those on the go. I would recommend Skechers brand to anyone."
236310,1,My husband loves these shoes and they are getting increasingly harder to find. These are the best! I ususally order two pair at a time
201505,0,"The shoe that I received looked fine, but it did not fit as well as the one it replaced that I purchased in a brick and mortar store. It seemed a bit larger. I did not realize until I had worn it out a few times that the width was W (wide) and not M (medium) the size that I ordered. I will keep them and hope that with socks they will be ok. I have never ordered shoes by mail, because I did not want to have to go through the return process if something was not right. Unfortunately, it happened the first time and I didn't even realize that the order was filled incorrectly. This order was not fulfilled by Amazon, but by Shoebuy. I buy a lot from Amazon and will continue. Though, I do not think I will buy clothes or shoes by mail anymore."
297803,0,"I enjoy walking 2 miles everyday at lunchtime at work with my colleague, and I thought these shoes would be great for that purpose because they're cute, stylish, AND functional. Before that, I'd put on my old running shoes just for the lunch walk. I thought I could save maybe 5 minutes by not having to switch to another pair.Well, it turns out that as cute and comfortable as these shoes are, they're not really made for walking. Walking around work and going shopping in them was fine, but walking just 2 miles in them ended up hurting my feet because of the lack of arch support.I still wear these cute shoes to work, but I now change into my running shoes for the lunch walk. Not everyone may have the same problem, but I have neutral feet and a normal arch, and it still hurt me, so I thought I'd put in my $0.02."
236945,1,"This is my third pair of these shoes purchased over the past 4 years. I now have azure, natural, and black and wear them all summer long. It's very hard to find summer casual shoes that come in narrow widths, and these are very comfortable as well as versatile. You can wear them with shorts or casual skirts. When I can find them, I wear a 9.5AAAA in dress shoes. A 9AA in the Trinidads fits great."
112879,0,"I REALLY LIKE THE LOOKS AND COMFORT OF THESE SHOES . HOWEVER , THEY ARE IMPROPERLY SIZED . I WEAR A 12D AND THIS SHOE IS ABOT 1/2 TO 1 SIZE LARGER THAN A 12 . WHEN PLACED HEEL TO TOE WITH ANY SHOE THAT I OWN , THEY ARE MUCH LONGER . A FRIEND MADE A COMMENT ON THER LENGTH ."
124804,1,This number is absolute comfort for walking.....much admired here in New Zealand.
347129,1,"I bought this Converse sneaker in black. These All Star sneakers look stylish and good with any casual pants I own. I would have given the product 5 stars, EXCEPT, these shoes are like walking on bricks since they have no cushion in the soles for the heels. I understand they're supposed to have the whole classic appeal... but if you're over 30 years old and try to rock a pair of Converse for an entire day, you may encounter some uncomfortable lower back pain. So 4 stars for fashion."
225559,1,"I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe."
322668,1,These shoes are very comfortable and durable. They fit very well. Would reccomend them to anyone looking for a comfortable pair of shoes
207221,0,"Wasn't the exact boot pictured, but close enough that I am satisfied enough to not wait for them to be reshipped. The boots are fantastic for dress. Would not use them for any kind of work though. They're thin and suede. Very nice looking and fit perfectly, which is impotant considering I couldn't try them on."
109014,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
204897,1,"I would give it 5 stars but I don't like how white it is and that it has a big logo on it. Functionally it is really great. I bought a timer so that I don't leave it on all the time, but set the timer to come on a few hours before leaving in the morning and then again a few hours before coming home to warm up the slippers!"
137387,1,"THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS TOP-NOTCH, SAME AS THE SNEAKERS! I HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR YEARS AND WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO LIKES COMFORT AND A GOOD PRICE."
7245,0,"I was disappointed after reading all the great reviews on these shoes. I could tell they would be really comfortable when I put them on and stood up, everywhere except the toe box. They are bullet shaped, like many other brands. I think most brands are made for a man's foot- I need a narrow heel and wider, deeper toe box. I really wanted these to work for me but I can't stand shoes that rub against my outer toe area and pinch my toes. I don't have wide feet- in fact they are sort of narrow. But they are definitely not bullet shaped. If I got these in wide they would be too wide throughout the rest of the shoe- so I had to return them."
301951,0,These shoes are way to expensive. I love the look of them..but really they arn't that comfertable. I think that they need to lower the price!
113373,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
277015,1,"Got my third pair of these boots just 3 weeks ago and have been wearing them about 3 times a week and, just like the others I have had in the past, they are already comfortably broken in. Waterproofing has been very good and I re-spray them about once a year. Very good on trail with firm support especially good on rocky conditions. Relatively light weight."
117456,1,"I bought these because I only want zero heel drop shoes to run in. These things have great traction for any type of surface. I've run on the track, the road, and even on the back country of the Carson/Iceberg wilderness in CA. They do what they are intended to do- provide a lightweight fast ride, with little support. These are not the right shoes for heel strike runners as there is about 1/3 the normal amount of cushioning at the heel. I think it's becoming common knowledge now that we all need to not heel strike anyway.The only drawback is that the shoes are not as durable as a heavier shoe, but that's what has to be sacraficed for the weight reduction. I've had them for about 6 weeks and have worn out some of the rubber lugs(does not affect performance or feel) and there is a tiny tear in the fabric on the side. But, like I said, I took them out for a couple of true cross country(miles of off trail) excursions where even hiking boots would have gotton some wear. I've put about 100 miles total on them so far, and will likely get at least 200 more- pretty good for a sub $40 shoe.Overall great shoes, and I plan to purchase some more!"
258639,1,"My son wanted either red or green Chuck Taylors which are fairly difficult to find. The shoes I bought arrived quickly, were good quality, and were priced very reasonably."
291180,1,The product came quickly...at a good price...very happy with the service...so much so...my mother knicked them from me!!
183371,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
141713,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
367767,2,"I think the shoe is fairly comfortable, but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area! Eccos are better!"
37545,1,"When I first opened the box, I was disgusted. They looked like ""old people shoes,"" but I figured I would try them out anyways, and within a few hours they looked great. Last week I found out that they meet my school's dress code. Since making that discovery, I've been wearing them for eight hours every school day, and they are holding up well, and they are amazingly comfy.You can rock them with jeans, cargo shorts ot khakis."
178375,1,I just couldn't ask for a better pair of shoe than this. The fit is perfect. The leather uppers are just a jo to behold. They have remained shiny and clean the past 6 months that I have been using them. I am just hooping that French Shriner could come up with more shoe styles to choose from. Also this particular design doesn't come in saddle brown nor tan. Wish they'd make more colors of the design. Just love it!!!
114356,1,"We love the color, very comfortable, my niece just love them. These are high quality product let me tell you :) Order came as I expected, we are so happy with Capezio products :) and amazon has better prices than at the stores, I compared the prices :)"
384167,1,"I love these, I fine them very comfortable, no problem to break them in, I have been wearing this brand for the last three year."
187176,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
218850,1,"Got the shoes really fast, however they didn't fit. Called the number got the information to verify they had the one I wanted in my size. Returned and got the replacement even faster than the original order. Excellent service. Will definately shop here again."
294325,1,this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had.Thanks
116301,1,"Before I ordered these shoes I was worried over choosing the correct size. The reviews were very up and down on what was the best size to order. I ended up ordering my daughter her street size 9.5 and one size up 10.5 to be sure that one would fit. I also ordered the Ms because my daughter has normal sized feet. Ns are always too narrow. I also measured her foot to make sure that the shoe sizing chart in inches matched with her normal size, before ordering.I ordered them on a Wednesday night and received them by Friday afternoon. I was very surprised and happy about the fast delivery since her ballet class begins next week. The 9.5 ended up fitting the best and they left just a bit of wiggle room for her tiny toes. I plan to keep the 10.5 for when her feet grow. I suggest sizing your child's foot and then comparing it to the size chart. I am very happy with my purchase and think that these ballet slippers will be very useful for her class!"
236306,1,"I really found these shoes thrown away; they looked new, so I keptthem. It was several months before I tried them on because theywere a little larger size than I usually wear. Early last summer,I needed a pair of shoes just to ruff around in, so I started towear the ones that I had found. To my surprise, the K.SWISS tennislike shoes were a perfect fit. I have worn them most of the time,and I am amazed at how well they have lasted and how comfortablethey are. I got on the computer just this evening wanting to knowhow expensive they were, and I was amazed at how inexpensive theyare for being such an excellent shoe. I wear the heels out veyquickly on most of my shoes, but these K.SWISS heels are just asgood as the day I found them. I would reccommend them to anyone.For me, this has been a real gift from the Lord, and I am onlysorry that I did not reccognize this long before now or I wouldhave taken much better care of these fine shoes.Henry in Lancaster, PA"
69413,1,Sizing was good. I usually wear 8 1/2 extra wide shoes. The mediums have plenty of room. They are not shoes I would wear all day because I need more support for all day wear. They are great for quick trips out or wearing around the house.
133313,1,"There seems to be some mixed reviews when it comes to buying the correct size but I did some research online and read that Capezio Daisy 205 Ballet Shoes go by street size. So, I purchased size 10.5 for my daughter who wears 10.5 in street shoes. And, the fit was perfect. The shoes seem to be well made and very strong... cute too with the little flower print on the inside."
149444,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
149952,1,"I love these shoes. I have them in black & I wear them all the time because they are super cute and comfortable. They look really cute with skinny jeans & crop pants. They seem to be durable but are made of a silk-like fabric, so I wouldn't buy them if you live in a wet climate. They also run large, so size down. I normally wear a 8 1/2 to 9 and I had to purchase an 8. I would highly recommend these shoes."
236594,1,Wonderful shoes! That's the simplest way to put it. Very comfortable and breathing. Helped in maintaining arch support and biomechanics
376208,1,I was in need of a new pair of bowling shoes and I seem to have chosen the right pair. I ordered them and they came in less than a week which was great. They fit nice and they look nice as well. I rated them 4 stars.
271210,1,"the boots were nicer than expected, I was very happy with my purchase, until I tried them on and realized they were too big:(After I returned them, which was also a very simple process that went without a glitch, I realized I had paid 2/3 of the cost of the boots just in s & h. Therefore, I did not reorder. I still want the boots, but can't afford taking another chance on size problems-I will have paid more in s & h then the boots cost."
362560,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
242807,0,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year. They were smaller than the 1.5 last year. Her true foot size is a 3. Nothing bad with the quality of the shoe but the sizing needs some work. If you need to order this shoe, size up 1 to 2 sizes."
79459,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
291157,1,"Ordered yesterday and I received today. These are soooooooo comfortable. I love them.I ordered three pair in different colors. I am getting married in two weeks and the ivory pair will be worn, due to a ankle break. No heels for me, for a while.My seamstress will be covering them to match my dress (beaded).Great for the feet."
277664,1,"My ex bought these for me for $70 to get me into hiking here in the Cascades around Seattle (I have always hiked wearing regular shoes, but on flatter terrain in Northern California). I have always worn them with hiking socks and liners and they have been phenomenal. I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down. After two years I can still slosh through creeks and melting snow and I've never gotten wet feet. The boots have held up well and look as though they'll last another year or two of hiking and snowshoeing."
267794,1,"I have been buying these boots for the last 5 yrs they are great. I buy a new pair in the late fall and use them for around the house and out and about during the winter months, then I cycle them into my work boots during spring and replace them the next spring. They stay waterproof with no care taken and the soles do not split away like a lot of boots do, at work I 'am outside a lot in all kinds of weather snow, rain, and bitter cold they keep your feet warm in winter and they are not hot in the middle of summer. I highly recommend these boots, people are always asking what kind they are and the answer is Hi-Tec Altitude IV! (And no I do not work for Hi-Tec) but support any company that makes a great product."
112757,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
185480,0,"It is ok for this price. But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes.But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes."
357170,1,My friends call them my &#34;40s shoes&#34; and I get compliments on them all the time at work which is pretty much the only place I wear them. They are sturdy and comfortable but I had to add no-skids to them to keep from slipping on the hardwood floors. Even on stage I used to have to do that. I wish they made these for everyday wear like with a real heel cover and weatherproof bottom sole but hey - these arent for wearing around town after all. Still I love em and think theyre great! I also have them in black.
154342,2,"I bought a pair of Eccos every year for many years, until the sole of my Seawalkers fell apart in a sticky goopy mess. Ecco said since it was over a year they couldn't do anything for me. I haven't bought any Ecco's since. It's a crying shame because they were the best thing I could find. It's very weird to have your soles turn into a slippery sticky mess.After a couple years, and trying a couple other hiking boot brands, I thought I'd give Ecco another try, but the size I used to wear was too big for me by a lot, and the next size down was too small. The ding dong at the store said my feet got smaller (that doesn't even make sense). So I took 3 old pairs into the store and the new shoe of the same size and same model (Track II) was obviously bigger than the old shoes I brought in, by nearly half an inch.Ecco shoes are not exactly cheap. I wonder why the quality control is not working. It's not like they are $15 shoes from Kmart or Walmart, that you kind of wonder how they can even afford to make them.I used to think Ecco was terrific, but with the soles disintegrating, and the sizing inconsistencies, I wonder what has gone wrong at Ecco Headquarters. My Seawalkers disintegrated a few years ago, but searching the internet, it still seems like a problem.I'm still hoping for signs the company turns around. I loved my Eccos."
45014,1,"I've used these shoes for 2 years now, and I bowl 3 - 4 times a week. These shoes are great for the bowler who doesn't bowl often and are looking for a good shoe for a good price.The good things about this shoe:~ Great arch support~ Good value for the price~ Holds up well with wear~ It is easily found in a wide width (And there aren't many wide width bowling shoes!)~ Looks like an athletic shoe - some like that lookThe not so good things about this shoe:~ This shoe is a little small. I have one foot that is a size 10 and the other is a size 10 1/2. Normally, I can wear a size 10 - except in athletic shoes, where I need a size 10 1/2. Heck, it's difficult enough to find a wide width in bowling shoes, let alone a size 10 1/2! And a size 11 is just too big. This worked for me, but not always the most comfortable.~ The shoe is white, and I swear it picks up dirt faster than any shoe I've ever had! I know I'm tough on shoes, and I know bowling alleys are not the cleanest places, but dang!~ Ater 2 years, these shoes look ""old."" Now, I bowl 3 - 4 times a week, and when we travel, we take our bowling bags and bowl on the road. It just seems these shoes break down quickly. YMMV~ These shoes look like an athletic shoe. Some might like that, others might not. I'm not thrilled with it. It was the only wide width bowling shoe I could find at the time.~ Does not really slide all that well. (Which may be a plus, depending on how you bowl)I don't mean to come down too harshly on this shoe. If you are a casual bowler and don't want to use the rental shoes, this is a great little bargain shoe. If you bowl more often, you might want to look for something else. This is not the most comfortable shoe, but it will see you through a couple of games one or twice a week."
371569,1,I love Reebok so much. The shoes are so comfortable and the other stuff is also really great! All my friends and I have at least 6 pairs of reebok shoes in our closets. And the designs are really great too.
354560,1,I bought these boots for my son last Christmas. He has loved them since he took them out of the box. He said they wear great. These boots are going into their second winter here in Michigan and they still look great. These are great boots and worth every penny.
309157,1,awesome shoes even though made in china. shoes seem a little larger than advertise. but nevertheless awesome value for these clarks brand shoes. couldn't be happier.
255799,0,"I was so intent on finding ""wide"" toddler shoes, that I overlooked the shoelaces. We wanted velcro shoes, so ended up returning these."
325577,1,One of the most comfortable pair of heels I've ever owned! They're great for walking and looking fashionable!
169945,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
242974,1,This is the most comforable shoes I have every worn. I bought a pair about 5 years ago and was searching in local stores where I live. They were no where to be found. Then I searched on-line. I recommend them highly!!!
17790,1,I've been wearing this shoe for years. It has always been very comfortable and long-wearing.
15908,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
23718,1,"The title says it. This is a great product! My second set of Reef Fannings and I don't think I could be much happier with them. Very comfortable, looks great for kicking around town, and perfect for a day on the boat. Plus, you never have to worry about forgetting your bottle-opener. Also, shipping was quick and painless. Only downside is they are a bit pricey. Also, be careful about size. I am usually a US 9.5, but I got an 8.5 and it fits me perfectly... Overall, great experience!"
163786,0,"Beautiful shoe and true to size. I have always been happy with the Anne Klein brand...but the description said ""fabric"". I received velvet shoes. The description should say velvet not just fabric. I returned the shoes because really how often do you ever need velvet shoes...I wanted fabric for special occations."
100086,1,These sandal have a great comfortable feel. Good quality material and very lite. Not just for man. If you need comfort on you tired feet these sandals are the best.
344896,0,"I sent these shoes back because they were too small.I could have got 1/2 size larger. But, I wasn't sure 1/2 size would work. Probably would have. I recently broke my ankle.It's a nice looking shoe. I'm an old timer and like the retro look. Not into outer space shoes of today.The padding wasn't that good. I've had a lot of shoes with better padding."
358799,1,It isn't perfect but it cleaned up my suede shoes. The bar does deteriorate a bit when using but this is expected. It does so at a very slow rate. I don't see myself running out of it at any point.
142709,1,"Great boot in every way. Looks, comfort, performance. Price was very competitive price. I live in these boots. Due to the heel height, a problem I have due to an injury does not affect me as it would in a low heel shoe. I play baseball in these boots. Yeah, they are great!"
186586,1,"I absolutely wore my other pair out. I have wide,high arch feet and hard to fit.These are great walking shoes"
303111,1,"I have 4 pairs of these Clarks sandals in different colors and the soles of my blue ones finally wore out. I found these on Amazon.com and immediately bought them. They are a couple of shades darker than my blue ones but just as comfortable and will go with the blue items in my wardrobe. This shoe style has been around for many years. I would have to travel a distance to a Clark's store and then there is no guarantee they would have the shoe and in the color I was looking for. When I saw them on Amazon.com, I quickly purchased them and they arrived a few days later. They are extremely comfortable and completely adjustable because of the 3 straps with buckles."
75277,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
374167,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
246287,1,"The boots were very nice, warm and extremely comfortable but not much on looks. Also, I followed the advice of reviewers before me and ordered a size bigger and they are too big. So I would say they must be true to size."
189425,1,"This is the second time I have purchased this boot, and I would have to say ""Its a great deal, and a good work boot"". Even though these boots ""Can"" last up to a couple of years on the outside, I purchase a new pair ""Every year"" just because the inside comfort doesnt last that long. I use these boots for climbing poles and standing on ladders 30ft in the air. Only found two downfalls about these, 1. Moisture does seem to get to my socks and feet after a couple of months of wear. 2. You can feel the steel shank on the bottom of your foot when wearing the boots, wich make them a little uncomfortable. I will continue to buy unless I find a more comfortable boot for the same price."
199065,1,"These boots were exactly what I was looking for - waterproof, warm, comfortable and they actually fit! I have been enjoying these boots very much. They do not hurt my shin bone like duck boots do."
111155,1,"Finally got my 2nd pair of these. Had my first pair for about 3+ years of heavy use. When it came time to replace I wanted to try a higher end boot. Got a pair of Merrils and had problems with the fit of the right boot, then they started to rub the top of my toes, again, in the right boot. Was frustrated and decided to go with ""tried and true"" and ordered my 2nd pair of these. So with HEAVY use I can say...Pros:-fit right out of the box, don't really need to break them in-waterproofing held up and still is on my original pair, I'm impressed-they're very light weight and VERY comfortable-they look good-they're great on downhills (not all hiking boots are)-not too badly priced; especially if you get them on saleCons:-The traction isn't as aggressive as I'd like-the tread wears a little quick and since there wasn't an aggressive tread to begin with it seems they wore down too soon. I continue to wear my old pair for dirty jobs as work boots and they're fine but on slick surfaces or muddy slopes they got a little to slick a little too soon-the laces that come with these boots won't stay tied for anything; plan on replacing them immediately-The insoles are cheap; I used the originals for the life of my first pair but bought new insoles for my 2nd pair and it almost transforms the boot in a good way. I LOVE my 2nd pair a 100% more with the new insoles.-They eyelets have never broken on mine as others have reported but they are a bit sharp so they wear thinner laces (the kind I prefer) rather quickly.-You can really feel rocks through the sole; these are better for smoother trails; for really rocky terrain they're a bit thin.When I wear out my 2nd pair I'll try again to find my ""ultimate"" hikers but frankly for the money you'd be hard pressed to get much better than these. I know I listed quite a few cons but don't shy away; just get them on sale and buy some better insoles and you'll have a great boot. The fact that my 1st pair are still waterproof after such heavy use is really impressive to me and the old pair are still more than serviceable."
195357,1,"Great shoe, as always. I buy nothing but Croc's for all of comfort shoes. Price was great also."
165016,1,I have worn Easy spirit Women's shoes for years and they are really a good shoe.Gives good support and always fits well.
382704,1,"Very pleased with this item, it was exactly what I was looking for. It's very comfortable and true to size (I got size 9 sandals but normally wear 8.5) and have had it for a year now and its lasted and is in good shape still."
208111,1,I'm very pleased with these sneakers. They are sleek and fit well. They are very lightweight and will be good for outdoor terrain. The spikes are easily removed for indoor use. They are ventilated so that your feet don't overheat. The order was shipped in good time and the package arrived in excellent shape.
361488,1,"For the price, you can't get any more comfortable than these. From the first time I slipped my feet into the sandals, I knew I needed more than one pair. They are awesome. I purchased a pair for my teenage son and he loves them too!"
324072,1,"I have neuropathy and the Birkenstock Sandal is the only one that is comfy to wear, stylish and very reasonably priced."
22625,1,"This shoe is perfect for keeping at the backdoor, slip them on and it's play time."
120041,1,"these are a great classic shoe. not a ton of support but thats what i expected.when i opened the box i thought amazon had sent me the wrong color. i was expecting something more grey/khaki but got something that was more like army green. i guess i read khaki green in the description and overlooked the green part, ha. nevertheless i am enjoying these shoes. styyyyyyyyyyyylish."
145495,1,"High quality, a perfect gift, check back with me in 10 years, but I think they'll make a good run for it, pardon the pun..."
236769,1,"The shoes were great, but I have such a small feet they were too big. Sorry I had to return them."
360983,1,"This shoe is extremely sexy. I will warn you that the heel is REALLY high and can be uncomfortable after a while. But then, what high heeled shoe isn't? The price is right and the company is solid."
258178,1,These shoes are awesome! they look great with everything. you will not be sorry you bought them.
194734,0,"After I wore the shoes the first day, they turned into a dog magnet. Not sure I can wear them now, but they are very comfortable and the width can be adjusted in two places. If you don't like your feet to hurt, buy these shoes. Dressy enough to wear to work."
92146,0,"I bought this shoe (in black) along with 1 Lifestyles and 1 Clarks sandal. All three of these shoes are supposedly known for it's comfort. Out of the three, this was the least comfortable one...(Overall). I bought this in Wide. (These don't hurt by the end of the day.. however, after 3 days of wearing it, it'd start to hurt on the sides. The heel of the shoe was a bit narrow and there wasn't as much padding as the other two brands. If you're looking for a comfortable shoe, try out Clarks. (You can practically run in those!!!). One good thing about Naturalizers are that they come in Wide."
356204,1,"I just got these shoes- the soles are uncomfortable, but they were on $13 and they look pretty nice- a good deal on a shoe you will just wear every once in a while for the looks."
54091,1,I ordered these for my mom. She has always wore these even when she was a waitress. Both pairs she wares all the time. Shipping time was excellent!
325264,1,"I have a heavy gait, and a wide foot. These shoes fit perfectly, and they last. I just retired one pair after 400 miles (compared to the typical 185 miles I got on the NB 991).I couldn't disagree more with the first reviewer. I think these shoes are great."
40925,1,very cute boots for toddlers. stylish and practical.gore-tex is a great technology to prevent soaking.I gave only 4 stars as they are rather difficult to put on
50143,1,these boots a great just gotta break them in. which will take me prolly a good week of wearing. got a good deal too. about 2 days after i placed my ordered they went up like $20!
119424,0,"This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price. But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B. A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available. Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days. I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present."
291835,1,"very comfortable , a bit wide ,but soft leather and beautiful color -good for all day standing on your feet"
220297,0,"Reebok's Classic Ace is not a bad shoe but, for me, not as good as the true classic. I bought a pair of these when I could't find the Classic running shoe."
228111,1,"I wore out my first pair after 2 years. I have to have these in my shoe rack, have alot of other more expensive shoes but these are far and away my favorite!"
288458,1,Great product. Have worn these for years and they never disappoint me. Comfortable and good fit. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.
1331,1,"I live in northern Minnesota and these are great for winter. Warm, waterproof and good grip on the icy sidewalks. Very comfortable too. I have a very nice pair of Sorel winter boots but they are HEAVY for day to day activities. During the winter I wear the Sorels to work and then keep a pair of tennis shoes in my office to change into once I get there. No need for that any more. Driving is nicer too. Have you ever tried to drive a vehicle with giant winter boots on? Not fun."
45908,1,Like walking on air. They are well cushioned and adjustable width. I'll buy these in other colors for sure. The ankle strap provides some support. I've had a couple of ankle surgeries so I need really well padded soles and these provide the comfort I need.
37602,1,My sone wanted a pair of these for Christmas. He loves them. Wears them to work with his dress pants. He just got out of the army and these work very well for his feet.
33653,1,"What else can I say? Converse's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades. They are comfortable, fun and in my case, red. I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own. Love them."
85305,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for about 6 months now and really like them. I plan on buying another pair to put back for when these wear out. As for those reviewers whos say that the soles wear out soon, take them to you local shoe shop. They can be re-soled."
3969,1,"I bought a black pair of these wrongly thinking that the nubuck leather was a compromise. They're quite stiff initially and have that slightly hairy suede look. After about 25 km in them now the leather has become soft and flexible, and after polishing with boot wax they're very smooth too much like the more expensive Ultra models. I've worn Hi-Tec's own carbon rubber sole before and consider it just as good as Vibram - will likely outlast the rest of the boot. So far have kept my feet dry in wet conditions. Only small criticism is that up top they're kind of chunky and it's a fine balancing act getting the lace tension just right so that your shins don't rub, though that should get easier with more wear. All up very good value for the price (the international price, not the Australian price)."
25312,0,"Like most Earth shoes, these shoes are quite large. If you have larger feet, they may exaggerate the size of your feet and are very noticable. I kept mine, but I'm finding I don't reach to wear them. They aren't the most comfortable to walk in - it definitely takes some getting used to. The slope in these shoes feels larger than other Earth shoes I've worn."
50408,0,"The shoe itself is sturdy, well designed and well made; however, the width is actually one width less. For example, a Wide is actually only a C and not really a D."
201760,0,"Super-cute shoe. Heel has great shape and is not too high. Sole has a lot of flex, which makes them a bit teetery. You wouldn't want to have to run in them."
60708,1,"I just bought these to use in the woods to play paintball, but also for general yard work, shoveling snow, etc. They weren't too hot, and give good support. I didn't test out their waterproof-ness, but I am happy with these boots for the price."
298536,1,"I've had them for about a month now, and they are FANNNTASIC!!!!!!!You HAVE To Bring Them BACK to Buy!!!!They go with Everything! and they are SOOOOOO Comfortable!!!!!!!!!I Have the GOLD Color!!! and I want to buy another two more pairs!!! of those!!!BRING THEM BACK!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"
196950,1,"This is a great looking boot that fits perfect after reading other reviews I ordered half size smaller. The other reviews helped,my normal size would have been too big. An american boot at good price."
65341,1,"I can't believe how comfy these mules are. I like the fact that the middle and back of my foot feels supported w/o the mule looking too clunky. They are a tad heavy, though doesn't make me feel like my foot is carrying major shoe weight so doesn't bother me.I haven't worn them in summer (got it just before xmas at an unbelievable price) so will be interesting to see how the very soft lining will hold up. No my feet don't sweat a lot but you KWIM - mules and clogs ain't always summer-friendly.I plan on wearing these in the Fall and Spring mostly, and so far, so good as winters here are mild. Loving these mules, even went for a walk in them yesterday. An added bonus - they look very nice:)"
351659,1,"I ordered these approx. March 2010. My feet are so happy I did! Warm, cozy, and supportive...they are a delight. These replaced a previous pair of Minnetonka slippers and are definitely an upgrade - thicker lining and stronger sole. Sizing is accurate (my foot measures 7.5 US, average width, and the 7.5 fits perfectly)."
332237,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
277248,1,The crocs I ordered were comfortable and of good quality. I loved the blue color. The fit was just right.
321744,1,"I am a major supporter of Minnetonka Moccasins - they're cute, comfortable, and ""different - looking."" I usually go for the brown shades, but this time I tried the red color. Great decision. I love the red; it is a really unique color, and it's just as comfortable and wearable as the more neutral colors."
365371,1,"I was debating whether I wanted to buy a pair online or just go into a store and buy them there. Boy am I glad I went to go buy them in person... as other people have mentioned, Converse run a little big so a size 11 (which I am) is really a 9 or so. I ended up getting an 8/5 and I haven't worn 8/5 size shoes since I was 13. You really want to go and buy them in person and completely avoid this problem."
229997,1,"Just what I expected. Awesome. I wear a 11.5 in most shoes and got a 12 here on purpose so I could wear thick winter socks. Even with the socks they are a bit roomy in the toe- so believe that &#34;run a half size large&#34; thing for Converse i guess. Other than that, this Pair of Chucks are exactly right on."
73755,1,The wrong item was shipped. Ordered a 1M child's size and received baby-sized shoes (some bizarre number not anywhere near what we had ordered). Return was easy.
388647,1,I love these shoes. This is my third pair of them. Good running shoe. Light weight.
182178,2,I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them. I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material. It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it. The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity. The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well. The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft. I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun. When I returned the sole was acutally curled. I am so disappointed. I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with.
175874,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
163408,0,"These covers work well for what I bought them for, but they're really a bit small. I got them for my husband to step outside to carry a dog out into the back yard, and they work fine. They're disposable, so we're not expecting multiple uses from them. But.......they are a tight fit over his shoes and he wears a 9.5. Maybe they'd be fine over a dress shoe or other similarly soled shoe, but they aren't a terrific fit over an athletic shoe."
243564,1,I followed recommendations from others who reviewed this product before me and ordered one size bigger. I didn't regret my decision. Those shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Definitely well worth the money and a great purchase for someone who just started.
258676,1,I'm really happy with these Chucks. Seller sent them in perfect condition a couple days before expected. Good Price. Good Purchase. Good Day!
89320,0,"I've had several other Indigo shoes and loved them. I have a pair of kitten heals in a 8 1/2 but in flats I always wear a US size 9 and have never needed to 'break them in'. Thats why I was SO disappointed when I got these home (size 9) and found that though the length was fine, they were very narrow. I couldn't even wear them for 5 minutes around the appartment they pinched so much. On looks alone I would have given '5 stars' but had to rate '3 stars' because the fit is inconsistant with other Indigos. Returned them. 'Summer shoe search' continues!"
146590,1,I bought these on sale for $15.00's for my daughter for Christmas. She LOVED them & said they were so comfortable & felt like they were already broken in. No rubbing or blisters. She has a hard time finding shoes that fit right. And this was the first time in along time shoes had fit her right. Would definately buy them again. Also recieved them in just afew days after ordering.
207619,1,"My husband bought a coin purse years ago in Paris that he loved - small, supple, held just enough change. It was simple - vendors used to sell them from carts at the Metro stations. The one he had finally ""bit the dust,"" and I searched all over to find another, short of making a trip to Paris. THIS IS IT - or the closest thing to it. I bought a few - they should last years. Very well made and manly looking."
9990,0,"This appears to be a well made boot. It is good looking and light weight too. However, it was strangely small/narrow sized.My left foot is larger and wider than my right. I ordered to fit the left, and in a wide size. When the boots arrived, I found they were not even comfortable on my (smaller) right foot. Not even close. Had to send them back for refund."
192638,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
115065,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
161636,1,"They were a last minute Christmas gift. They came so quickly, the size was normal, the color fun, he loved them."
67905,1,I ordered these for my daughter who's going to college in the north (snow). She would only wear Timb's. Daughters happy = I'm happy!
347151,1,"These shoes were shipped quickly, and were exactly as described. My son is thrilled with them. Thanks!"
94588,0,These are way too cute and took a little time to break in but are worth it. I love them and they look great with everthing
55117,1,I had been looking for Minnetonka Moccasins for my daughter. Her size was difficult to find in the local stores but I found exactly what she wanted on Amazon. The package arrived well before Christmas (a surprise gift for her) and she's been wearing them ever since. Great comfort. Wears well.
183390,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
297145,1,"I love these shoes. Very comfortable and feet my feet perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviews, these fit pretty much true to size for me, I'm glad I didn't order the next 1/2 size up. I think after the break in period, they will be perfect. I'm going to order a second pair."
308184,1,I'm really happy with these Chucks. Seller sent them in perfect condition a couple days before expected. Good Price. Good Purchase. Good Day!
19635,1,"Most comfortable, longest lasting shoes I have ever owned. Very good value. I don't wear anything else."
277903,1,"I have enjoyed wearing Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV for a number of years now----a good product. I titled this review as a ""Work Shoe"", but they are an excellent walking boot for me as well."
295310,0,"I got this for my recent Alaska trip.It provided me with good traction, but the a section of the rubber broke off after a single day of use!!A bit disappointing given that I had to use it for the next 10 days."
102783,1,"I was concerned buying this shoe because of the variety of reviews but I am so happy I did. I have been using the shoes for Zumba class. There is enough support and flexibility but yet enough movement in the sole since Zumba is quick on your feet with so many pivots and turns. I noticed prior to getting the shoes, I was beginning to have some knee problems but not anymore. Just remember all the reports......you must get one size larger....no if's, and's or but's. I wear a 9.5 and purchased a 10.5 and I actually hesitated but I am so glad I did. Again this is a great shoe with a price that won't break your purse."
200815,1,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
226979,1,I am not pleased with the fact that I returned the item & requested an exchange of a smaller size. Instead I was given a refund even after I filled out the exchange request. This was a gift for my daughter & she was disappointed that they refused to make the exchange.
188900,1,Have had several pair and I love these tennis shoes. Have worn them for years. They are getting harder to find but I will keep looking
186316,1,"Awesome shoes that I've bought several times over the years. I love the nondescript style and the (somewhat) retro look. Low key, nothing flashy but very cool.They're getting harder to find. Here's hoping Reebok keeps making these."
156536,1,"I'm on my feet all day as a Surgical Tech. This shoe is the absolute best for me. They provide great support, as well as protection, and hold up well. I've been wearing mine for a year now and even though they're still comfortable, they're beginning to look bad due to the abuse they've taken. I'm purchasing the same shoes as a replacment."
244992,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
333805,1,I wear these shoes around the house & outdoors whenever I want something quick & easy to put on. They are comfortable but don't provide much support.
332744,1,"Well made, comfortable, durable, water proof... Crocs are very versitile shoes and are great for water sports, beach wear, cleaning, rainy days, or just lounging around the house!"
49799,0,"The shoe itself is sturdy, well designed and well made; however, the width is actually one width less. For example, a Wide is actually only a C and not really a D."
221858,1,"I ordered these slippers after reading the many positive reviews for them. I have wide feet so I usually shop for shoes in person, but I decided to order the next size up knowing that returns on amazon are pretty easy to do.I cannot express how comfortable these slippers are in words (but i will try!). It feels like you are walking on a cloud of puffy wonderfulness. They keep my feet really warm too. One of my favorite things about coming home from work everyday is putting on my slippers while I relax with my computer. One thing though... because it's sheep skin, i recommend wearing socks instead of going barefoot. I could see them getting a little stinky if you skipped on the socks.These are the first pair of slippers I've ever owned and I plan to order more if the insides ever wear out. Love this product!"
280511,1,What a great boot this Caribou by Sorel is. I have had an older pair for years and decided to upgrade. I am so glad I did. They have updated this boot dramatically. Warm and wonderful.
319633,0,"Now, if you're a typical person, you'd probably find this shoe to be soft under foot. However, I stand for hours a day (teaching) and I found this shoe to be lacking. It ain't soft enough for my long-suffering feet and it's certainly less comfortable than a typical running shoe. If your workplace allows you to wear running shoes, just do it. You'll be happy you did. In that case, may I recommend to you the Asics GT-2170? It has a super-soft MIDSOLE, which is the IMPORTANT PART for comfort. I'm basically a shoe expert at this point in my life, and I must advise those who are looking for a comfortable shoe--I mean really soft!--to LOOK UNDER THE INSOLE AND PRESS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE MIDSOLE. If the midsole (under the insole) is hard, or even hard-ish, you will NOT be comfortable unless you have numb feet that are immune to pressure. So don't be fooled by super-soft-feeling insoles made of puffy, fluffy, light foam. They will compress on top of a hard midsole, and you'll be hurtin' and as irritated as two wet cats in a bag."
198648,1,"Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
79860,2,I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black. The black pair fits well and are comfortable...The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever! They hurt my feet and feel too small...I'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these.
4669,0,"These are adorable shoes, but they are more like slippers since there isn't any tread on the bottom. So if your little one can walk and wears these outside, they will get really dirty. They were tricky to put on straight and my daughter had trouble walking in them. In hindsight, I don't think I'd pay this much for a pair of toddler shoes if I wasn't sure they'd get worn."
379680,0,"Like most people have said, I'd suggest a half size up from your regular shoe size. I had bought character shoes from this company before, so I was pretty sure how they'd fit, but they changed the material they use for the top of the shoe since my first purchase. Now the black cover on the upper part of the shoe scuffs off VERY easily. I have only used mine for one show and there are already places where the top layer is rubbing off. I'm hoping that some black shoe polish or something like it will help."
240038,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
161197,1,"Came fast, look great, a great experience. The fit is amazing, the color is vibrant, and to know that it's a (red) product is awesome. Will defiantly recommend and buy from again."
39578,0,"I bought these for my wedding, as I wanted something comfortable and cute. They have a nice arch support, but the sole is not as cushy as other styles of Reefs. The thong part between your toes is made up of the two fabric sides sewn together instead of a ribbon that's folded inward (as with other styles), so the seam can rub wrong if you have sensitive toes. Overall, though, they are still more comfortable, stylish, and well-crafted than cheaper flip-flops."
67898,0,"I really love this boot... but everything great about it is superficial. They run narrow and have a cheap foot bed. Very poor support. But the style sure is what I like.I ordered an 8.5 wide and they were more like a medium... they were snug but after I broke them in they seemed to stretch out and felt better. They didn't last a year and a half before the insides were all tore up and I pulled a metal bar out of the footbed, lol. Huh?! That never happened before with any shoe. I didn't even use them everday... but I did do some walking in them. Nothing extreme. But the outside held up fine.Even though I knew better and feel they are waaaay overpriced for the quality... I love the look and ordered a second pair. This time in a size 9 wide so I could put some padding in there for better foot support. It seems to help. I will only wear them to work now as I don't know how quickly these will also fall apart..."
8218,1,Shoes are really pretty and comfortable. I have received many compliments. They are easy to clean and have a little elastic on the back that makes them easy to put on and take off. I have trouble wearing heels but I was able to handle these well.
127240,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
114947,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
42304,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
133859,1,"GREAT SHOES! BRAND NEW, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX! I LOVE THEM!"
36598,0,"I have not been overly impressed with this boot. I really wanted to love these boots, and I do love the vintage look but they just won me over. They are quite comfortable for a stroll in the park, but they are too low in the back and really dig into my lower angle when I get on the trail. The leather that the boot is made out of seems really soft and began to show signs of significant wear early in their life. They are great in terms of waterproofness, and temperature comfort but the just don't seem like they are made to take a beating like I typically expect from my boots. I do product testing for Gore-tex and have worn a lot of boots in my day and I probably should have paid more attention to the use of ""light"" in their name. If you are looking for a very light duty boot that looks really cool, and you don't need much for ankle support, this might be the boot for you. Overall they fit true to size and the vibram sole and gore-tex insert are a definite plus!"
267703,1,"These have been great hiking boots. The waterproofing has worked perfectly so far, and they've been comfortable, even on long hikes."
65214,1,"I never know, when buying shoes over the internet, if they size will be right. These shoes are true to size, good quality, and fit perfectly!"
332341,0,"I like these shoes a lot but are they really worth almost a $100 more than the sketchers I bought a year earlier. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra cushioning but would say cushioning insoles be just as effective and cheaper to boot? I guess it is one's individual preference. Me, I wish now I had just purchased another pair of Sketchers and bought some Dr. Scholl's insoles. Only time will tell if these outlast my last pair of boots and if so than that will be another plus."
356193,1,"I just got these shoes- the soles are uncomfortable, but they were on $13 and they look pretty nice- a good deal on a shoe you will just wear every once in a while for the looks."
26436,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
298884,1,"My wife wears these shoes to work, wears them everywhere but bed. She'd do that if I'd let her....lol. She has praised how comfortable they are since receiving them. Thank you for a wonderful product at a reasonable price. Excellent delivery."
311605,1,"I bought my original pair of these shoes in a store, but when they were worn out and i needed another pair, the store didn't have them anymore so i bought a pair from amazon. Over the years, i think i've worn at least 5 pairs of these shoes. Sadly, they seem to be discontinued now and are no longer available in my size in any color.They are the most comfortable shoes i've ever had. It's going to be hard to replace them with something else."
316586,1,"Have been playing tennis (age 48) with the 16yr olds on the High School tennis team. Feet were hurting afterwards which now I realize was mostly due to non specialized big box shoes made for ""cross training"".These shoes look good but most of all feel great, giving needed support for tired feet."
74913,0,"The shoes are very cute, but they are very narrow. Also if you have real legs and actually have some calf muscles you are going to have a problem. I have to zip the boots up and then pull them up over my legs. Also they scrunch up about the bottom they do not have a nice sleek look to them."
127053,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
126096,1,I purchased these shoes for my mom for my upcoming wedding and she just loves them. She says they are very comfortable and will have love use of them in the future. They are well constructed and have a very good width to them. i would purchase them myself and would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality and comfortable shoe.
63549,0,"This is the second time I purchased these boots. The first time (7 years ago) everything was good. This time I gave the boots a 5 week break-in period but after two days on the trail I had some pinch points, but no blisters. The real disappointment was the waterproofing. Of the 5 days I was out on the trail I had 3 days of rain or overcast. On the first day after 5 hours of wet grass I had wet feet. I was hoping to keep my feet dry this trip."
281021,1,"I have worn Keds sneakers for over 50 years. The quality is superb & the comfort is wonderful, whether wearing with socks or not. Highly recommend."
267920,1,"My old Hi-tec Windhoek's finally wore out. I use these boots as my everyday and light hiking boots. Amazon's price for the Altitude IV is unbelievable since a local boot store was selling them for $84.00. Seems like a nice sturdy boot with agressive soles that should give me lots of wear time. The size was just right. The upper hook eyelets are a little difficult to get the laces to, but with practice it gets easier."
347533,1,Very cute my husband is 67 but he still loves his converse allstars! Thanks!! Every thing is up to loving!
244077,1,I love these shoes because they are top quality and perfect for narrow feet. Be sure to up the size because they run small in length.
25787,0,These shoes are very light and appear durable. I had hoped for more spring in the step. I find that it is difficult to tie the shoes with the tightness I prefer.
218286,1,Thank you so much for your prompt arrival!! These were purchased as a gift to my best mate and the godfather to my daughter as he is a bit addicted to shoes! He absolutley loved them and put them on straight away! He found that the added spare pair of red laces was an added bonus! The size was perfect and the description exactly as advertised!Thank you again for your quick service and quality product!
360489,1,"My daughter was required to get these shoes for her high school drama program. We never imagined that they would be so comfortable. She now wears them to ballroom dancing lessons and will use them in any stage presentation she takes part in. I would highly remcommend these shoes to anyone who is involved in theater. They are comfortable, and provide a stable base for movements that increases safety and confidence."
236236,1,I enjoyed these shoes. They are basic but comfortable shoes. I am comfortable with the large width and easy velcour strap.
49025,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
43352,1,"These were top-of-the-line shoes, when sold new, back then in 2003 (or what ever year it was). However, from what I remember, the size 8 shoes had a slight quality control problem, or at least it seemed like it to me. The right shoe would sometimes be a little flatter in the sole, or maybe slightly uneven, or something like that. The left and right shoes would not be the same, in some way. If you happened to get a good pair, then you lucked out. They were comfortable, springy, and an excellent fit.They were also recommended for heavier runners, and I found that they definitely cushioned out and reduced any pavement shock on my knees and other joints.That's why when I saw recently that this particular model was still available, I bought a pair. The pair I recently got are not perfect. The right side feels a little bumpy in one spot. However, even so, they are currently my most favorite and most comfortable pair of shoes, which I wear all the time."
62310,1,"My grandaughter is so pleased and happy with her shoes. They are awesome as she wanted. The article came on time for a day she has to used. Good service, excellent pruchase"
309147,1,"Not much to say other than my wife likes them, they're comfortable to wear (even with arch supports embedded), and they seem to be holding up quite well. I bought them from Amazon when on sale and have been very pleased with the purchase. As an aside, Amazon originally sent a more expensive pair from Clarks by mistake. The company paid for return shipping and new shipping of the correct pair."
55633,0,"While the price and width availability was attractive, these shoes are not for the serious walker. They offer little in support and left me with sore feet and a serious blister on my right heel, even after several days' worth of comfortable wear. If you want a cute, inexpensive shoe for casual wear, they're a good value for the price. If you're looking for a walking/exercise shoe, invest the money in something else."
343554,1,"I love these shoes! You will too!PRO'S:- The leather is so soft and comfortable.- The inside soles of the shoes are like gel pillows - so comfortable.- The color is actually prettier than it appears in the picture.- True to the size they say. I ordered a size 6, my normal size, and they fit perfect.CON'S:- Can't think of any.- Of course a cheaper price would always be better, but I paid $34.95 and they are well worth every penny!If you want comfort and a simple, clean looking style - these are for you! They look great with shorts, jeans, or casual pants."
65938,1,I really do love this sneaker they are comfortable. price is awesome! second pair I own thank you adidas for making this great shoes
340880,1,These are nice and soft slippers but they are very large around the they were much to short for the given size. I kept them only because I knew they would stretch a bit and have but still to short which is sad. I do not like slippers with rubber or synthetic soles for our doors and these are soft leather which is why I bought them.
10401,1,"I bought it for my girlfriend because it's her favorite ballet shoe, it's the second she have, all the same, she doesn't change it for others."
58602,1,"i have a pair of light pink keds that i've had for 10+ years. when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again, i decided to get a pair of red. buying from amazon i saved a bunch, and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals. i love them!"
159937,1,"After searching the malls for authentic Chuck Taylor Kelly Green Hi-tops, with no luck, I wised up and went to the [...] web site, where I not only found Kelly Green Hi-tops for my son, I also used their unique design your own shoes feature, to design a pair of custom high tops just for me. We are both thrilled with our finds. Chuck Taylor's are the shoe of choice in our household, I even got my conservative, old school hubby into a pair of Chuck Taylor leather Hi-tops."
161928,1,"I got a pair of converse shoes for Christmas almost 3 years ago, and I have been wearing these shoes almost ever since. They feel comfortable, they look good, and they have hardly any wear on them after 3 years. As a matter of fact, I have them on right now as i am writing this review..I'm thinking about buying another pair in a different color just because i love them so much."
338784,1,"This shoes are legendary, not really too much to say about them. You know it, I know it,.. They're back, more than ever.. get yours now. Confy as the most expensive snickers out there."
305062,2,"I hate the boots! I purchased a pair for $110 in October of 2012. After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder. Regardless of the floor surface; carpet, concrete, or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder. It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem. I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $15.Thanksgiving goes by, then Christmas, then New Years with no word about my shoes. Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes. A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland. I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again. I am out $125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise."
149510,1,"These boots are well made (and made in the USA), very comfortable and look great. They have not left black marks on my socks like many other oil-tanned boots that I own. My only negative critique about them is that the laces are a bit on the short side. Not a big deal as I was planning on replacing them with black colored laces anyhow. Not crazy about the brown and black mixed sole? Having the soles dyed all black at the local shoemaker's shop was surprisingly inexpensive. Overall a nice boot at a nice price."
190130,1,"I already own a pair of these shooes and like them, so I bought an extra pair and I'm really happy and they arrived fast;)."
318367,0,"This shoe ran big and I needed a half size smaller and a D width rather than a wide. The ad states the shoe has a soft crepe type sole but it came with a hard synthetic sole. It was not very flexible and it's been my experience that if a shoe needs much 'breaking in', it won't be very comfortable."
243791,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
58447,1,"These are extremely good sneakers! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal. Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars. These are great basic shoes. An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform. I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern. These are very flexable shoes, the laces are better than other brands. These sell for around $30 generally. For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market. If you like old school Converse, Jack Purcell, Vans then I think you'll be very happy to own these classic shoes. A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans. Just go with the originals! If I could afforf it I'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now. The other styles Keds now makes look great as well. If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear. I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities. No downsides to these that I can see. 5 stars!!"
186069,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
371010,1,I bought this converses for my daughter with the idea of a weekend shoes. When she saw it she loved it so much she uses it for school. She loves them!
131535,1,Bought these flip flops for my daughter who says they are comfortable and pretty. She wears them almost until the snow flies. They do not irritate her toes.
48717,0,"These boots are super cute. I actually purchased them for a Halloween costume. Because I have small feet and wide calves, I thought the lace-up feature would help. It does help, however the tongue is too small so it looks weird. I think they're my best option, so I'll take them to a shoe-repair place to have a wider tongue and longer laces put on. From what I could tell, they felt fairly comfortable in the foot though."
82548,1,"Shoes were received quickly and were just as pictured on line. This is the second pair I've owned and just like the first pair, the quality is excellent and they fit perfectly. I wear them everyday all summer long and they just get more comfortable all the time."
261661,1,"I was skeptical about the comfort level of these shoes, given their seemingly flat design. I was wrong! These shoes are very comfortable and supportive. I wear them all the time. Best casual sneaker! Great price."
328416,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
282694,1,"A staple in our family. Love Rainbows, last forever. Bought themfor our son, this is his 5th pair, we all also own a pair"
31906,0,"I am a farmer, and I wear these Tingley boots in harsh conditions, and they last about a year. I have used these boots for years, but I am considering switching brands. Simply put, they do not fit. I order the XXL, and my feet are not that big, but they are difficult to get on and remove because the ankle section is too tight, and the heels of my shoes are incredibly difficult to fit into the boots. Farmer that I am, I use silicone spray to enable my shoes to slide into the boot easier. Without the spray, the boots would tear. Alas, my silicone spray keeps disappearing. My wife puts it somewhere, or uses it, and, ergo, we have endless fights. This is getting old, and so I may switch."
297729,1,"I have this shoes in black and it's just amazing. I use this almost everytime I go out, and even for several hours I do not have any problems. I can use this with my jeans, shorts or even sweat pants and it fits just perfect. I can't believe how nice it fits and I can say, this is one of the best shoes from Skechers I have ever purchased."
49197,1,"I buy a new pair every two years because I wear them out. They are so stylish and comfortable, I try to get away with wearing them at work too. Love these shoes."
295940,1,This really is a great product. I can walk the dog and not worry about slipping. The only thing I would advise is to put them on your boots or shoes first and then put on the boots. They really have a snug fit and it's easier to do it this way.
60585,1,If you want some comfortable boots these are the ones . My 5th consecutive pair .
290874,1,"Awesome...is the best word I can use to describe these running shoes. I wore them to the gym yesterday and they are probably the most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever owned. I usually buy New Balance which I have always liked, buy I might be an Adidas convert now. I've already ordered a second pair as a backup. I use my athletic shoes for the gym (50 min. on elliptical & weights), brisk walking and some jogging. These shoes even have me excited about getting back into running -- that's how great they feel!!"
207823,1,Great product and fast service. You gotta get the product to the buyer quickly and that is what this company did for me.
139352,1,they were great while they lasted (: after so many wears i donated the shoes. such a shame :( i miss them
85278,1,Just what I wanted. It is comfortable and good looking. I had previously ordered another shoe inthepast but without have gone to a store for meausurement what i ordered was too small and a little uncomfortable but these Dockers were fine.
76395,1,"I saw another review that mentioned that the Passports squeak. I have the same issue. They are a good looking shoe, and they're pretty comfortable. They do have a larger, boxier toe that does make them more of a casual look than something you would wear to dress up in. I'm mostly wearing them in a business casual work environment with some weekend duty. The leather has a pebbly grain to it that looks good when they start to break in. I have the ""redwood"" model.A lot of reviews comment on the style, but I find very few mention the sizing for some reason. Since it's easy enough to tell if you like them or not, I'll discuss the fit. Normally, I wear a 13 in athletic shoes (Nike, Brooks) and a 12 in a boot or dress shoe. I ordered these in the size 12 and found them to be a little larger than my usual 12 fit. After breaking in over the weekend with a lot of walking, it seemed like they loosened up a bit and are now about a 1/2 size too large. I wear super-thick Thorlo socks with them, so it might be a full size with ""regular"" socks. Arch support isn't as much as I would like, either. But arch support and fit can be addressed with an insert.If I buy these again, I'll get them a half-size smaller."
349763,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
27730,0,"The picture of the mike jones versions looked the best i thought, as i had heard they were very comfortable, which is indeed true. but when i got them, i guess i didnt realize the white stitching on the red/black shoe stood out soo much, it looks kind of wierd, but they are pretty good overall, especially for $20!"
266685,1,My husband has loved these boots for years and I was happy to find them still available - he enjoyed receiving 2 pairs for Christmas.
352254,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
266379,1,"fit good right out of the box, true to size, and very well made. Good price amazon and very fast shipping even to Turkey!"
316223,1,"Yay love these shoes. Very cute & comfortable :). THANK GOD i read the reviews first, they said to buy them a half size smaller or even a size smaller & i did & they fit greattttttt =] . Very pleased with my buy."
131528,1,These are truly one of the best sandals I have ever owned. They are cushioned its like your walking on clouds. I highly recommend these sandals. I wear them everywhere!
329570,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
306581,1,"The crocs professionals are the perfect shoe for me as a baker. They are light, comfortable, vented but don't have all the holes on top to get filled with flour. I have worn this style for several years now."
266992,1,My husband wanted a pair of steel toed sneakers for work instead of boots. He is very pleased with this pair of sneakers. They are quite comfortable and he is on his feet all day.
298132,0,"Here's this skinny about these shoes. Theyre super comfy and have a great feel to them. For that, I enjoy them.I wear mine to work when I'm dressing a little more casually and sometimes out with friends. I intentionally don't wear them when i know I'm going to be outdoors or standing in dirty areas. I do this because of the white-ish/yellow-ish colored sole.Even being very judicious with wearing conditions, the sole is completely black on the bottom and the discoloration is creeping up the back heel.I've probably worn the shoes 5 times so this result is frustrating.Second, and to a lesser extent, I was disappointed to find that the pictured Beeswax Leather color (shown on most retailers and the Clark's webpage) is nothing like what you get. The picture shows a distressed look where the actual product is not distressed at all. The coloration is a uniform dark chocolate color that looks nothing like the picture.If you're OK with a solid dark brown shoe that will have a quickly blackened sole even when worn carefully. This is the shoe for you."
85217,0,I have been blessed with feet that do not sweat much... and generally stinky shoes are not a big problem.I got some Keen Taos sandals- my sis in law bought the newports...Both of us have discovered... they get a distinctive fungal funk within a few times of wearing them.Ordinary laundering does not remove the odor. I finally used an enzyme for cleaning septic taks. It diminished the odor about 85% - but still did not totally eliminate it.
384216,1,Has worn Easy Spirit's shoes for years and loves them. Local store no longer handles and was very pleased to get this pair. Service by seller was superb.
20214,1,The rockport shoes that i purchased are the most comfortable shoes i have had. I will definitely make future purchases in the future. Totally satisfied with the product.
286340,1,"Great shoes for wet wading or just hanging in the river. However, even though they are self bailing, they are not safe for swimming. I've had these for about 2 yrs and used thim many times. Last weekend my kayak got swamped in a waterfall and while trying to swim out, these shoes just about made me a permanent fixture of the river. So don't use them for swimming, they do not allow you to kick well to swim and the added weight of them after being completely submerged is a killer...literally"
2731,1,"This shoe goo clear is exactly as described, rather large tube, about the size of a regular toothpaste. Dries pretty fast, Quite potent smell and vapors though so use in a well ventilated area & be careful around children and babies. Just my personal two cents. A+"
278538,1,These are very nice boots. Love the styling and appearance. They do need to be broken in a little when you first get them.
155027,1,The product is quality with the matching &#34;classical pink&#34; that is needed in our studio. The laces tighten well and tuck in easily. Our daughter loves them.
224853,1,"My classmates would show up to school with red, green, white, and black, and numerous other color schemed Converse, and wear them all day, every day...even during P.E. (now THAT tells you something). Their conversations would be full of ""Are you getting new low tops or high tops? They're on sale today!"" or ""Cute Converse!!!"". I'd smile and wave them on. Converse...REALLY? What in the world is so great about Converse?I used to see Converse as unneccessary, too common, and not worth the money. Boy, was I wrong! I recently purchased my first pair of Converse over Spring Break. The first thing I said when I wore them for the first time was ""WOW, ARE THESE LIGHT!!!!"" They are extremely comfy and can go with almost any outfit! And, while the stylishness of Converse may be an opinionated topic for some, I think these are the cutest shoes in the world. No wonder so many people love them. I can say with confidence that these will not be my only pair ;) So, with that in mind, if you do not own a pair of Converse, check them out. You'll be glad you did. Believe me."
154166,1,Shoes are very comfortable and a great fit for my feet. Extremely satisfied w/ this purchase.
248508,1,"My daughter wanted these timberland for Christmas, she has purchase them before so I known what she wanted. These are very nice boots"
107299,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
6761,1,I got my shoes on time and they look great! I wear a size 10 and was nervous about whether would be loose or tight but they were the perfect size. They are very comfortable and Sperry makes a great product so they should last. These would look great with any casual clothing and the price was reasonable as well.
202668,1,My oldest grandson picked these out so I ordered for one of his Xmas gifts. They arrived and look exactly as he wanted.You can't beat the price!!! Another gift crossed off.
38597,1,"These are really Great boots,............ I would recommend these for any growing boy, or girl,............ Just buy a half size larger!!!!!!"
133841,1,This was perfect.. It was true to size brand New as suspected and I would recommend this product to anyone
101714,0,"The size runs small. My daughter wears a size 6 in shoes so I ordered a 6 in this shoe too, however it was way too small. Couldn't even get on her foot. It seems a 6 in this shoe is equivalent to her other size 4 shoes.The quality seems good though if you how their sizes run."
160298,1,"My daughter found these at a major department store, the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so she checked other stores and we could not get any. I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my door. Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here, so easy! Thanks!"
330346,1,"As someone who spends most of the work day on his feet, I really appreciate a comfortable, well-fitting pair of shoes, and these Rockport Margins fill that role admirably. They have that classic oxford styling; professional-looking, but not too fancy to be practical in a retail/office environment. This is the third pair I've purchased, and I've found them to be durable and easy to care for. If you need a dress casual shoe that's kind to your feet, try these."
364398,1,"This is standard issue footwear for anyone who wants the ""look"" of indie rock (the others are t-shirts that look to be from a redneck bar circa 1978 but really came from a suburban Old Navy circa 2010 and those ""washed-out"" blue jeans that were purchased at the same Old Navy). The shoes are grossly unfit for any athletic activity (I don't know how the heck I survived playing street hockey in these things as a teenager), provide no protection against the cold or stepping on sharp objects, begin to smell horribly after 9+ months of use and have a tendency to have the sole tear away from the rest of the shoe after those 9 months (if the smell hasn't destroyed them yet). But their coolness factor will never, ever be replicated by any footwear, past, present or future (the Roman sandal gave them a run for their money in the 1980s by the garage punk band Thee Mighty Caesars, but that's another story). Everyone should own a pair of these shoes at least once in their lifetimes."
261965,1,"This is the 2nd pair of shoes I have owned in this same style, and I LOVE them because they last FOREVER! However, the best part about Eastlands is they make a large selection of women's shoes in a size 12. Thanks Eastland for looking out for us women who have long feet!!!!"
11438,1,"First off, I'm not really a kid, but I don't want to sign up for an acount. Know that. I bought a pair a couple months ago. They obviously get kudos in the cool facter right off the bat. Then I put them to the real test. On the court. They are super comfortable and are still holding up great. They also breathe very well.This brings me to the only problems. Soon after I bought a pair, my friend did too. He plays in them not only on the hard-court, but on the black top when he's practicing also. Therefore he uses them A LOT. A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins. I've only heard of this happening to a couple people, but if you abuse your shows as much as my friend does, you might want to look else where. Also the sound of the pump is audible. Not terribly noticable, expecialy on the court.All in all, this is a great shoe and really encourage you buying it. Whether you want it for hoops or for style, it's sick no matter what."
273826,1,"Got my boots and have been using in my wooded property. The fit is good and the boots work as advertised. The price point on these are just right - good value for the dollar and its a recommended buy. I saw a post here complaining about the smell of the new boots. They smell like new PVC... as one should expect...but they are outdoor boots so not sure what the issue is there. Another complaint I saw was that they are not fashionable enough. Really? These are work boots so if its fashion you are looking for then PVC work boots probably are not an area you need to be looking into. Anyhoo, good boots for the price. Go get 'em."
277338,1,Been wearing Etnies for years but for some reason they have lost some of their quality and comfort recently. Decided to give these eS's a try. Worn them a few times already and I am more than impressed. I generally live in skate shoes when not at work and these have been impressive. I wear either a 14 or 15 depending on the style and manufacturer and these fit great and are extremely comfortable.
162381,1,"These shoes are what I was looking for..but, they do run a little big. So be sure to get a size down from your regular size. I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe..They are comfortable and you cant beat the price..shipping was pretty face as well."
96539,1,I have using this shoes for more than 3 years it's so comfortable I got 3 pairs including the latest I ordered.Its durable and comfortable to use.
250293,2,"I have multiple pairs of Kenneth Cole Reaction shoes, all in size 8.5, so that's what I ordered. These are a size too big on me. Very disappointing.Adorable shoe and looks like it'd be comfortable, but can't walk in them to find out."
138747,1,"Keds is a classic and never goes out of style. It is always hard to find my size, 12W, but I found it here with no problem. Would recomment to everyone!"
83634,1,"Love these shoes, these are the 3rd pair I've bought b/c I wear them ALL THE TIME!! Great shoes, so comfortable, versatile!! You will want to live in them ALL summer!"
61029,0,"Expensive shoes, I was really excited about it but got a little dissapointed with it, quality little low, materials seems to be cheap"
160403,1,"Very smooth purchase, excellent price - the best anywhere and believe me I searched, very fast delivery, really good communication. Thank you"
268675,1,"I'm a beginner to intermediate climber and these shoes are great. Several of my climbing friends have this brand and I knew my size because my climbing gym has this brand. Love he velcro - makes it slip on and easy to take on and off between climbs. Only thing is if you're into a lot of outdoor climbing it's probably best to get a shoe with more rubber at the toes. For me this is pretty much what I needed, at a great price. I'm usually a 7.5 or 8 and went with a 7.5. A little too tight at first but loosened so it's just tight enough as climbing shoes should be."
153405,1,It was a great bargain for the money. I priced this product in a lot of different sites and it was a deal. They feel wonderful.
165349,1,Easy Spirit shoes of all types are unquestionably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I recently bought 5 different types of shoes and they are all fantastic. I have medical issues that make it difficult for me to wear shoes of any kind. Easy Spirit allows me to walk like I haven't for several years. Quality and comfort are fantastic.
75689,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
268195,0,"This is a wonderful shoe, however due to the European sizing, each size covers two US sizes. Had to return for next smaller size which was a little snug."
88421,1,"These shoes are very soft, comfortable, elegant and they are molded excellently to the form of the foot. They are the best shoes that I have and do not change them into anything."
54775,1,The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected. I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider.
259981,1,"quick response, fast delivery, great shoes for just about any outfit."
190188,0,"I absolutely love the way these shoes look. But, the strap in the back will not stay up. I tried everything. I even put a new hole for the buckle to go through just thinking they need to be tighter...No luck. I only wear them when I am not going to do a lot of standing..."
77505,1,"They're comfy and look great with skirts, jeans, etc. Almost always get a compliment from a passserby."
66040,1,I have worn these all winter and they have kept my feet dry and warm. I live on a college campus so I do a lot of bike riding and walking and they have held up great.
97429,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
289384,1,I needed a bag to carry a computer in that would serve as a handbag as well. This bag was as advertised. I have adapted it for use as a handbag also. Good quality.
227740,1,this is my first time buying from amazon and it was a great experience. with 3-5 day shipping they came in 3 days. the shoes are great of course. this is my third pair of converse so i knew what to expect. they were in perfect condition when i received them. definitely don't hesitate to buy!
133818,1,"The Melissa shoe gives a perfect look to any outfit. The texture and the unusual varieties of colors this product gives can make any outfit seem like the best. The way the shoes shapes the foot and brings out your natural texture as well as the shoes color is awesome. No wonder this product is so popular among all teenage girls today. Melissa's are a great shoe, it brings out the best in you and whatever you may wear."
85858,1,The crocs I ordered for my son was reasonably priced and was delivered on a timely fashion. I was very hapy with the convenience of the purchase.
254865,0,"They look great and intially felt great on. So much so that I brought them on a week long trip as one of two pairs. After day two I realized I made a mistake. The lace design lacks ankle support and after walking it shows/feels. I still like the way they look, but I won't wear them to work or if I know I will be on my feet most of the day."
337015,1,"I am a teacher and at Christmas time each year I ask for a student's name of whom the counselors or home health nurses know is not going to havea Christmas because of family finances and/or struggles. Well, this year I was given the name of a student I had in my own class and whom I had already had sucha great connection and loved this kid. To find out they were not going to have a Christmas broke my heart!! Anyway, through some other sources,I was able to find out what this student wanted more than anything, if they could ask for just even one gift for Christmas. The student said they would love to have some REAL Chuck Taylor blue high-tops !!The fake ones they had saved money to buy at a local ""discount"" store fell apart so fast and they felt they had wasted their money.So ... I ordered these for that student and had them given anonymously. Let me tell you ... when that student entered my classroom the very morning after the y received these surprise gifted shoes ....that kid was so excited to show me, so happy in general, so excited to see everyone and openly socialize with head held high. Wow ... what great things these shoes did for this student in far more ways thanjust keep their feet dry My heart was fulfilled and this student will forever remember these shoes, I am certain!!"
306558,1,"The time of the order was fast and perfect. I was very please with the delivery time. The style, look and fashion of the boots was amazing. We were very happy with them. I would recommend others to order from this vendor. My niece is so in love with her pink cowgirl boots. She does not want to take them off. Everyone who knows her has to she her model her boots. thanks we are very happy!"
39784,1,These are not only comfy but stylish! I have had many pairs of Reefs over the years. They are long lasting and the only flip flops I will buy. They cost a bit more but are worth it. Reefs are well made and form to your feet over time. You will not be disappointed.
105739,1,"How can you go wrong with traditional Chuck's? I've got several pairs and wear them everywhere from weddings, to school, work and shopping. Jeans and shorts."
295934,1,An absolute necessity for a Wisconsin Winter with a 60 pound border collie mix pulling you down the ice-skating rink of a sidewalk!They were delivered in 2 days. Great buy!
288725,1,I love Reebok so much. The shoes are so comfortable and the other stuff is also really great! All my friends and I have at least 6 pairs of reebok shoes in our closets. And the designs are really great too.
28229,1,"Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. The one thing she said she likes best is that ""it feels like they are giving your feet a hug"". The shoes seem put together well and the Miami Red is a great color. Very modern and fresh. Overall it was a fantastic purchase for back to school."
241159,1,I purchased these for my grandson for Christmas - They arrived in plenty of time and were exactly what I ordered. It was all he asked for and he was totally excited when he opened them. He put them on immediately and just kept telling me how much he loved his shoes.
126886,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
246439,1,"Great comfortable shoe with nice style, only thing I did not like is the hint of a seam on the side"
244429,1,"Are a great shoes, are confortable and it seems resistant, the most i like of this shoe is that make you a little tall."
245547,1,"purchased these April of 2010, am very hard on shoes, could not fault these. tips of laces haven't lasted but the laces have. they have been drenched w/water oil, sweat & are finally stretched out a bit. will buy more. wish they came with smooth soles."
102026,1,I ordered these boots and they came as promised. I was not satisfied with the model and had no problems sending them back. The model 3040 Justin to me is a better boot. This boot has a thin sole and a very low profile heel.
22159,1,muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
216939,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
321855,1,"Love these boots, if you are looking for a comfortable stileto heeled boot, THIS IS IT!You should order 1/2 size larger than your usual size due to the pointed toe.They are comfortable, even after hours of wear.LOVE THEM!"
220769,1,"I have this flip flop in graphite. It actually looks like a gun metal and shines. They are thicker in the sole than the thinner strap style making it cushiony when you walk. Again I have no problems with any rubbing and the toe feels great. The color that is advertised is different when you see it in person. No matter since the color is unusual, and I have had a woman walk up to me and bend over to see them. She could not believe how pretty they looked and the price is fabulous. Ten dollars cheaper than the thinner strap style. I never saw these before until I saw them here on Amazon. Macy's sell these as well but not in this cool color. These flip-flops are fabulous and I am now a fan for life."
280667,0,"Low stars because I never got to them try out. Bought the desert boot ankle high a little before. Oxford length was ok, but wrap around top of foot was way tight. Might try a 1/2 size larger on these. The desert boot ran a full size below just like another reviewer mentioned. I'd go 1/2 size below normal size on the oxford."
104179,1,I have flat feet and have trouble finding shoes that are comfortable.The bone on the side my foot would hurt and nothing seemed to help. I bought a lot shoes in hopes of getting some relief. It seems that every pair could use a little adjustment of one form or another. That was until I bought the Eastland Newports. I am on my third pair. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. When your feet hurt you are not able to fully function. Get these so you can quit thinking about your feet. If you have wide feet or bunions I recommend these shoes.If you are on your feet a lot these shoes will make you happy.
349437,2,I normally wear an extra wide shoe. I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it.
199125,1,"The laces are a little annoying if not tied securely, but do go a size down if your socks are not very thick. I usually wear thicker socks with this pair (and I already have inserts) for a nice fit."
193417,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
291444,1,My grandson hasn't taken his boots off since Christmas. He loves them and thinks they are the coolest! I think they are going to hold up really well too.
348122,1,"I bought these for my partner for xmas & he loves them, says they feel like walking on clouds. They look very nice too, I'm so glad he has some decent dress shoes."
38920,1,"I think that is a good product, is very important the cost, and this product is comfortable.buy now. Thanks"
356550,1,"I bought these after having own Asics 2080s, which I loved. I wanted another pair of shoes with the IGS system. The product description says that these shoes do, but upon receiving them I do not believe that they do. No where on the shoe does it say IGS, unlike my 2080s which clearly have the IGS symbol on the heel.Other than that, they are fairly comfortable shoes. I have not had the opportunity to run in them yet, as I am still breaking them in."
224131,1,"Product was just as advertised. Only concern was that I did not receive a tracking number so I had no idea when exactly it would arrive. Other than that, great seller =)"
244082,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
121357,0,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
282977,2,"I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes, comfortable and long lasting, they finally died. I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here, not as comfortable as the original (the others looked better for the work place too) but I broken them in and they were acceptable. Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two. Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same. Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them. Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much. One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear. The quality has really degraded. You might want to look elsewhere."
77900,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
6618,1,Dad loves his new boating shoes says they are super comfy and wears them all the time: ) Great Price !
46377,1,Love the Rivas. Bought at $10 less than anywhere else I could find. Fast delivery and shoes arrived perfectly.
85694,1,"I love my Crocs! I had a pair before and after 2.5 yrs. of wearing them at least part of every day, the treads were wearing off the bottoms of them so I had to order a new pair. I have a heel spur and this is the ONLY shoe I can wear first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night. I also like them for standing to do the dishes. Of course, wearing them to the beach is cool, too."

355041,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
132836,0,"I loved these shoes as they were comfortable and great with jeans. After a few months of wearing, the sole on both shoes split in half. I was able to glue, but that only lasted for a week or so."
332430,1,"For the money, this is well made, comfortable shoe. I purchased it in both black and cordovan and the leather appears to be well dyed so that color will not scuff off. The soles and heels are not as ""hard"" a rubber as I would want, but I would not expect a shoe at this price point to last more than a year any way. I would purchase these again."
167925,1,The Reebok Amaze mid is a comfortable shoe that also provides great ankle support and a cool look. These shoes can match any outfit you have and make people look twice. Highly reccomended
360876,0,"I wanted something that was a bit dressy but not as fancy as to be incompatible with something casual.From the looks of it, this shoe seemed like the perfect fit. I wish I could have gotten views of it at different angles before I bought it, but that's just too bad.I think they're a bit too pointed in my opinion, but they fit great and look good. I think there are better shoes, though, if you wear a suit to work. If your dress code includes khaki's this is more than alright."
278066,1,First pair lasted a couple of years and served me well; paid a little more for a full leather upper a year ago and these babies still keep my feet warm and dry. Good value boot for the money.
143739,1,"Nice solid old school looking shoe. Not as comfortable as a lot of athletic shoes I own, but not bad either."
235689,1,These shoes are one of the most comfortable I have ever worn. They hold up very well. I have been buying them for years. It was great to find them on line because not every store carries them. I don't know why.
332619,0,"They have really big bumps and lots of them inside. Then the raised part under the toes is not too comfortable for someone with uncommon foot shapes. They are probably really good once you get used to them. I just looked inside the worn-out pair I have. They are smoother. I think they vary in the interiors quite a bit. I bought a pair of these, but returned them due to them being too bumpy. Mine are so old now, I don't know what they were like new."
309768,1,I am very pleased with these shoes. They are extremely comfortable and very well made. I've also received many compliments on them.
163805,1,These shoes are great and comfortable for my daughter. Just be sure to order about 1 1/2 size UP with these. We ordered a 13 1/2 for my daughter and they were VERY tight! She needed a size 2 to have a little space in there.
255946,1,"I have these in several colors. They are so comfortable to wear. My feet swell alot and these make it easy to at least wear a shoe, with or without socks."
254899,1,"Desert Boots and Chukka's have quickly become one of the most popular style of boots over the last couple of years. There are literally hundreds of different options out there if your looking for this style boot and the prices can range from roughly $50 all the way up to $400 dollars. With that being said, Clarks Original Desert Boot is easily one of the best of the bunch especially when it comes to getting the most bang for your buck.I absolutely love this style boot and have over 15 pairs sitting in my closet from companies such as J.Crew, Johnston & Murphy, Frye, Diesel, John Varvatos, Red Wing, Bed:Stu, Original Penguin etc. Out of all the companies I have purchased this style boot from, there are really two that stand out more than the others in regards to getting the most bang for your buck. Those two are Clarks and J.Crew. Both make high quality boots and both keep things simple in regards to the design and that is exactly how I prefer them.Clarks Original Desert Boot is really the epitome of simple design. No flashy cuts of leather, no funky patina's, just a clean design using classic colors and high quality full grain leather or suede. If you think these are comfortable when you first try them on, wait until you have had a pair for 6 months. These boots become like butter on your feet. In all honesty, that is one of the greatest aspects to this style of boot, they break in and become one of the most comfortable pairs of boots you have ever worn. Out of all the boots I own, its my broken in Chukka's and Desert Boots that are the most comfortable. Some of my Clark Desert Boots are over 4 years old and they are still in amazing shape. In fact, as I stated in regards to comfort, they only getter better with age. If you take proper care of them they will last a very long time.Bottom line - Again there are now hundreds of choices out there for this style boot but very few can match Clarks Desert Boots especially when you consider the price. These are easily one of the best deals out there in regards to mens footwear. If your late to the Chukka/Desert Boot game then what are you waiting for? Every man should have at least a couple pairs in his closet. Clarks Desert Boot is a perfect place to start. The Taupe Suede & Brown Suede are the 2 that I recommend the most. They go with practically everything.5 Stars!!"
317768,1,"I ordered these crocs cayman shoes in light blue as a birthday gift for my 2 year old nephew. They are lightweight (literally, light as a feather!) and form perfectly to his little feet. He loves them...he can even put them on himself. They are adorable on kids, and I love the light blue color. I definitely recommend these for toddlers."
168999,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
124462,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
57395,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
158655,1,"This is the best running shoe I have ever owned! I had trouble with my LCL, not anymore. I used to start to get tired after 4 miles, I can go twice as long with these. If you have flat, narrow feet and small ankles, this is the shoe for you. Pretty good arch support. Could use more, but I'm not complaining!! I hope they never discontinue this shoe!"
309187,1,"These were my first pair of really nice shoes and will probably be the only tennis shoes I will ever buy. They are very versatile; I can wear them when I am out on a walk, on a run, to school, to church and they are great when I am traveling. They even fit bulky orthotics and my wide feet that other tennis shoes are not made to handle. Adidas are comfortable, stylish and the ultimate tennis shoe!"
118387,1,Get about 1/2 size bigger than the actual shoe size. Quite comfortable. Got it for my 5 year old cousin and she loved it.
348500,1,"I just bought a new pair of Ecco Track II Highs -- replacing my previous pair that I wore nearly every day for over 7 years. (I said nearly every day -- I did give them a rest now and then.)From day one, these boots fit my feet perfectly -- like they were made for my foot! (Absolutely no hot spots or pinching whatsoever.) They are classy looking and work well with casual office attire, yet rugged enough for almost any non-extreme activity. I have used them for absolutely everyting! Slogging around in the rain and light snow, distance hiking, walking, putzing around town, driving, motorcyling, working in the yard, you name it. Light and supple yet still rugged, they provide excellent ankle support and keep your feet dry during wet adventures. They breath exceptionally well also. My old Eccos have been demoted to the Jethro Bodene boot pile, but I still intend to wear the old pair for grubby wear until they just give out completely.Friends, these Ecco Track II's are simply top quality foot gear that you will be proud to own and pleased to wear. And with just minimal care, they will provide you with years and years of reliable service."
65736,1,These shoes proived to support for a hard game and have the looks of a street shoe. The perfect all around shoe.
326745,0,"The sandals are cushy enough and seem sturdy, but the straps get twisted every time I put them on and if I don't take the time to straighten them out it makes it uncomfortable to walk. I've never had this problem with a pair of flip flops. Maybe the straps are too thin."
341960,1,"I've owned various colors of this shoe over the years. They are classic and comfortable. They feel a little tight when you first try them on, but they always stretch to fit your feet like a glove. Great shoe!"
342549,1,Great purchase. The only place we could find these shoes in the right color. Fast and quick.
105903,1,"I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. The color is vibrant and full of life! Also, converse are great shoes."
138755,0,I recently had foot surgery and was looking for a nice wide plain sneaker. These are really cute but not wide enough. I would order the widest they offer. I will be giving these away and ordering the wider one. I really like them
195629,0,Please see my full review on the other location for this item. Fit great but sure didnt last as long as my old durashocks.
162717,1,"I stumbled upon this boot in wine patent leather and was so impressed by its look, decided to try it on. I was a little afraid that the pointy toe would hurt if I didn't go up a size. To my surprise the boot fit perfectly in my normal size 10. I got quite a few compliments on these boots. They are stylish, sexy and relatively comfortable. Because of the heel the arch is a little high so I don't see it as a shoe that can be worn throughout a long day. But still a lot of bang for the buck."
32126,1,"I've been playing soccer for my entire life and at last I've found a shoe that doesn't hurt my feet after a game.Very good traction , beatifull design and very original model.Thank you ADIDAS."
292459,1,"These are perfectly comfortable, I have had these boots before, so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget. I wear a ladies 5.5-6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great!"
192179,1,"These are some of the most comfortable shoes that I own. I never thought that flip flops would provide so much support or be comfortable enough to wear all day, but these are!"
81333,1,"El producto fue entregado en el tiempo establecido, Producto original, Departamento 100% garantizado, los converse chuck taylor negros son los clasicos y por ser as&iacute; son los mejores"
89949,1,I have had many Eastland shoes and this is the one I prefer if I can get it. Liked the AMazon price.
152515,1,I never would have thought this shoes look cute. They are very comfortable and sport looking very easy to match with t-shirts and jeans or shorts. The price was really good.
27036,1,I love these Life Stride Sandals. Can be worn when dressed up or casual. Very comfortable. Planning on purchasing more in several colors.
184712,1,"I have been wearing Reef Ginger sandals for several years now. They are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever worn. I stand on my feet for 8+ hours a day and when I wear these sandals, my feet don't hurt. I've had several pairs of these flip-flops and I've never had a pair break--I just wear them out from wearing them so much!"
53159,1,Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down. My 10yr old daughter also loves hers.
332106,0,"Right O, this is a good shoe and very well made. I don't feel as if the shoe is true to size (at least for me - US 15W) out of the box. Not sure I'd buy them but that said, I am not entirely annoyed since it's a chance you take buying stuff online. Cheers!"
234272,1,I have worn this shoe before so I knew what i was buying and it was just what I expectged
17804,1,I've been wearing this shoe for years. It has always been very comfortable and long-wearing.
147413,1,"I needed a pair sneakers that were extra wide (8.5 EEEE) and had good arch supports. Propet sneakers are comfortiable, run true to size and have good arch supports. Plus they have a guarantee to last one thousand miles of walking."
134213,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
343109,1,Received the shoes sooner than expected. Will do business with you again. Thanks.
106195,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
131271,0,I bought these and ended up returning them. The shoe is exactly as pictured. The height of the shoe was comfortable. The rhinestones on top I found to be uncomfortable for me while walking so I decided not to keep them. They are an attractive looking shoe though.
100046,1,"These shoes arrived so quickly - 6 days earlier than promised! They fit perfectly - I am a 7.5 and they are true to size. Too cute for words, and comfortable too!"
187506,1,Christmas gift for my daughter. She got to open them early and she looooooves them!! Shipping was quick and no worries about the Uggs being authentic!
318610,1,"These are my second pair, I have a black pair and, now these are the only dress shoes I wear at work! The most comfortable shoes that you'd ever wear!"
12171,1,"Couldn't find this particular color/design combo in stores, so was very happy to find it here at a great price!Converse shoes run a bit big, so make sure you order a good half to one size smaller than you would wear"
348852,1,"These shoes are comfortable for getting around. Since it is a mans shoes I normally order down one size. There were no tens so I ordered the 10.5. The shoe fit fine, the 10 would not have given me the same comfort. I would recommend this as a walking shoe."
96131,1,This is a wonderful soft comfortable shoe that's perfect for every day wear but can take you into the evening as well. I bought two of the same in different colors. Highly recommend.
41533,1,"I had owned a pair similar to these before and was impressed with their durability, long lasting and remain looking good. These shoes are comfortable right out of the box without need for any break-in."
348962,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
194589,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
182975,1,"These are my second pair of Earth Lazers. I have a narrow foot, size 11, and they fit just perfectly. The heel is snug, and the toebed is more of a medium fit. But, when you walk in these shoes, the weight falls towards the heel, so you don't really need a narrow toe box. I did order them in a size ten, instead of the 11, and my foot feels supported and secure. It's great for someone with a bad back too. They are ultra light and fit easily into luggage for travel. You are probably not supposed to wash these, but I did in a low setting. They came out just fine. I don't think you should put them in the dryer, however. The price offered on Amazon, in conjunction with the Amazon credit card, made this too hard to resist. So glad I got them. Highly recommended!"
114874,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
242374,0,Mootsies Tootsies have always been my favorite. Have been wearing them for years. BUT the last pair I got ( which was ordered on Amazon) came apart after wearing them only a few times. Had to take them to a shoe repair to get them fixed. But now they are o k. Don't know if I will try again or not. Have to think about it.
43750,1,"I've been a Dansko wearer for about 5 years now. I still wear my first pair, but have several others. I am a hairstylist so a good, supportive shoe is a must. I have to warn anyone who wants a pair of these to keep something in mind; if they fit you in the heel they are too small! There should be a bit of ""slip"" when you walk in this shoe, as it should feel like a clog. People who don't like them usually buy the wrong size. A great investment!"
314325,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
172412,1,"These are the most comfortable thong sandals I have ever worn. It took some time to get used to the strap between my toes, but there was no chafing or blisters. I'm wearing them at work right now!"
222326,1,"I bought this shoe in size 7 1/2M and I love it.It is stylish and comfortable. I normally stay away from pointed toe shoes as they hurt my toes but I love these. They are absolutely comfortable and they go with several outfits, from jeans to skirts.Amazon delivered on time and I'm pleased as always with their service."
132521,1,These are very nice. They have great coloring & very supple. I would recommend these shoes. These are very well made.
246837,1,They were very nice slippers but I didn't need two pair. And they were too wide for me.
115378,1,I have been wearing Saucony Sneakers for three years. I have yet to find a comfier pair of walking shoes.
220039,0,"I have always loved Keds sneakers, however, 2 weeks after purchasing these shoes, the bottoms came loose and I had to throw them away."
381281,1,This is a great fitting shoe if you put a double air foam insoles in them. I now owe 6 pair in different colors.
292788,1,"quick response, fast delivery, great shoes for just about any outfit."
173903,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
348441,1,"These are the most comfortable boots I own. Very good cushuninig, making walking a pleasure. This is my second pair of this boot. Great value too. I've purchased boots at over twice the price and have been less satisfied. The soles won't last forever due to their softness, but they last long enough."
360935,1,"I am a cancer patient and need to keep my feet warm but be able to step out on doorstep to get mail, feed cats etc. This is great and everyone has complimented them. Very stylish and comfortable."
206536,1,I gave this to my wife whom went to The Ohio State and was very happy to receive the Ohio State Crocs. They were received in a timely manner and was well represented.
349980,1,"Excellent shoes,they are very confortable and easy for my feet, the color I would prefer Dark Red but was my mistake the color choice, they are pretty well made."
56039,1,"i love these. if you are getting them, get your EXACT size. really comfy. GETTING MORE. happy buyer, and more to purchase!"
388287,1,"TROOP Footwear is back for the 2k3 and they are hot. These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
7430,1,"We Purchase these every six months, they are great walking shoes, very comfortable, sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition"
307979,1,"When will there be more colours and sizes in 9M available???? This is a very comfortable shoe and good wearing. Will more be offered and if so,when? When one finds a good shoe and style it is disheartening that more are not on offer. Why change a good,sure thing????"
370773,1,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was &#34;dated&#34; in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
340919,0,"I purchased these less than a year ago. They were beautiful, comfy, and warm when I first got them. I had to purchase a new pair (I ended up getting Acorn brand) last week because these are falling apart. If you wear slippers everyday, you may want to consider getting a more durable brand."
38254,1,"I've been wearing Skechers's Alley Cats for 5 years now, I haven't worn a different shoe on a regular basis since, If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Alley Cats provide the comfortability I need throughout the day, and the style and design are awesome and rugged. For me, nothing beats a pair of alley cats to wear all day long. I wear them almost every single day and they don't start to tear or rip until minimum a year later. Great value for the money !"
289952,1,"This is my second pair of Timberland Pro Titan Hikers. They are rugged, good looking, and quite comfortable for steel-toed work boots. My only complaint is that the laces hooks at the top were too closed and fairly quickly wore-out the original laces. The replacements I bought are a little thinner, and that seems to have solved the problem."
216560,1,Was bought as a Christmas Gift. He enjoys them because of the material your feet can breathe much better.
321161,0,This shoe is nice looking but it is not as comfortable as some of the other Easy Spirit shoes I have.
358011,0,"I normally wear an 8.5 (wide, if they have it) so I ordered these shoes a 1/2 size up (and wide) from other reviews suggestions. Welp...it still wasn't enough. These shoes definitely run small, and with hindsight I would have ordered a 9.5. Because it's too small, and because I'm too cheap to send them back, I will wear them anyway and just suffer a little bit from the pinching on the top side of my foot and toe box area. They are very cute though, and the heel is low enough to walk a moderate distance, but tall enough to add a little length to the legs. I took a risk by buying shoes I had never tried on before online, and it was almost a good idea."
382582,2,"First off its Not attractive looking. and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT. Arch support really? I don't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house (didn't even walk around whole much). Very uncomfortable. Can't believe the price!!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it's considered one of the best ones they have, I say REEF SUCKS."
354659,1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quick with no hassles. Beats gas, time and crowds that are experienced when going to a brick and mortar store."
270635,1,"As I write this review, I'm recovering from a broken back, and the last thing I want to worry about is slipping on my hardwood floors. These guys give me the traction that I need. And who's idea was it that open-back, flip-flop scuffs can actually make for comfortable walking? Once again, losing a slipper in mid-stride is something that I want to keep off my worry list. The high back on these grippers is perfect for me. I've read reviews with complaints about them being warm. It's winter here now, and I view that as a bonus. If they're too hot in the summer, I'll wear something else. And then there's the size issue. I normally wear 13's so I ordered 12's hoping that after a week of wear they'd be a snug 12.5. That seems to be exactly where they're at now. The snug fit hasn't turned out to be annoyance. I started to look for them the other day and then realized that they were on my feet. I had a &#34;duh&#34; moment, but I got over it."
164158,1,"This shoe walks me! I guess that means that most other shoes fight the natural ergonomics of human stride, heel to toe! It is impressive! But beware, Merrell shoes run SMALL! I wear 9 1/2 to 10. This shoe fits me at 11 1/2! I have a very similar Merrell low top hiking shoe; but it is size 11! So for mail order, MAKE SURE RETURN IS FREE! Otherwise you will have to pay as I did to return for correct size. This shoe came as an Amazon purchase from ShoeMall! ShoeMall said I was not their customer so they do not pay for return shipping. Amazon paid what ShoeMall would pay = $7.00, but the cost with FedEx was $15.80 to return. OK! I love the shoe."
271694,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
113794,1,very cute and comfy. highly recommend. nice sandal that will never go out of style. thinking about getting more in different colors.
123629,1,"These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!!"
138397,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
202425,0,I am not a boater but I have always liked this style. I where these shoes everwhere and they are holding up well so far.there didnt seem to be more than a 2 hour break-in period which was really cool. They fit my feet well. The laces arent holding up quite as well as I hoped and I have had to replace them twice but at least laces are cheap.
360906,1,good indoor shoes. stylish as well. These are volleyball shoes which have enhanced outsole rubber for improved tractino and flexibility.fitting is ok. they just run a little narrow. I would suggest to buy half size up and wide if possible.
373527,1,"I am very happy with my purchase. The slippers are very elegant, they don't look like slippers, more like beautiful shoes. However, they are very comfy and come in several widths. My next pair might just as well be the same one !"
207569,1,"I ordered the black-multi, and was a little hesitant because the online pic looked like it had a kind of shiny texture in areas. I was very happy to see it is all suede-like texture, with cute stitching. Very comfortable, and usually I have trouble with boots fitting all the way up my muscular calves. For girls like me, it's nice to find these! (I paid $26.90 - a real steal!)"
264624,1,"I'm forced to purchase shoes over the Internet given my shoe size and that the local (Caribbean) stores don't often have my size in the styles I like. I'm partial to Bostonian and Giorgio Brutini as they seem to have standard styles. This Bostonian is the first shoe I've purchased unseen and I am pleased with the fit and the look. The shoe is also stitched at the bottom and that's very important to me. As I've only had the shoes for a month, it's a little early for me to discuss longevity and will update on this characteristic if durability becomes a factor in the future"
37053,1,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
184096,0,I ordered these on speck as I like Skechers brand they are nice shoes but quiet a small make. I am normally and 8 1/2! so if ordering these consider this. Good service disappointed with the shoe size though.Thanks
159993,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
211925,0,"I usually wear a 10AAA, but this shoe was too narrow for me. Maybe it would have stretched out, but I don't have the patience for that. So I had to return it."
1658,2,Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.
268013,1,"I bought these shoes in white, and they are adorable! I always get compliments when I wear them. That they're so ladylike, 40's/50's looking etc. I'm in love with these shoes, and despite the other review... I think they make my legs look great! There's nothing like a pair of high shoes to show off your legs! Only gripe, they're hard to walk in!"
340806,1,The shoes were just what I expected from Stride Rite at a wonderful price. My granddaughter wants to keep them on all the time.
260698,1,These shoes are the best things I Bought on amazon. I recomeend this product who wants the real converse. I love them and now i wear them everyday and everywhere i go!!! I cant wait till i buy or get my next pair!!
51542,1,This is the only shoe that I have found that doesn't lose its support after months and months of wear. My husband now wears them too because he does a lot of walking and this shoe is really kind to his feet and back.
193661,1,"I buy these shoes for my daughter to wear for P.E., she love them! The soles are thick and sturdy, something the school wants the kids to have. This is our tried and tested tennis shoe we use year after year! My daughter is 7 years old and has no problem in wearing these shoes."
256825,0,"I have a wide toe box, but a narrow heel. Wide 4E widths in New Balance or Asics fit me fine in the toe box and heel. The Spira in a 4E was a tad narrow in the toes and my heel popped up and down. Their wide width would be great for those with big, huge, fat wide feet all around, or those with wide heels. I tried Spiras a few years ago, and could feel the spring in my step, but NOT with these. And the cheap Chinese craftsmanship was very apparent--I had to cut the top holes of the shoes all the way through myself with scissor tips to make the laces go through. These classics were a real let-down and have promptly been returned."
202874,1,"I don't have this exact pair. I got mine from Bass Shoes (not Bass Pro) for $39. So, I like this one because of its price but also because of the toe portion. Some might shun sandals because stuff gets in them while you walk. Wood chips are not fun under your arch. However, the toes on these are covered which minimizes this issue. Nothing got in mine during the second half of a ten mile day hike I was on. The heel is not covered on these (mine are covered), but still provides a shoe like feel. If it's warm enough, these are great. You can walk through water without being bothered at all. Even water proof boots can get wet inside if the water is deep enough."
120545,1,"First of all I suggest 1/2 number less... if you compare it with adidas sneakers. The shoes are great, made with good materials, good design and very comfortable. I ordered these sneakers on black, but came gray on logo and the rear part, but there's no regret about it, looks so good. Definitely I recommend this item."
279951,1,"Great style and comfort... i love ADIDAS and i LOVE these shoes... great for daily wear, indoor or outdoor.they get a little dirty because they are white but since they are leather, they can be easily cleaned!"
337313,1,"These sandals are just great in comfort and appearance, wonderful for vacations. The service was speedy as always."
375786,1,"My wife has feet that hurt a lot. She chose these sneakers based on all the positive reviews. After wearing them for only one day, she declared these were her all time favorite sneakers! Thank you, Amazon for offering the best prices!"
296775,1,"I love this shoe! Very comfortable, light, and durable. The fit was perfect, and I got a lot of inquiries about where to get them. Can't wait to get my next pair."
32807,1,Pink cowgirl boots arrived on time for Christmas. The size ran small so I wish I'd order a larger size.Joanie
42642,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
151356,1,My son is very happy with this shoe! Very comfortable for getting around campus. The style seems to work with any casual wear.
292858,1,"They are chucks! You cant go wrong! Best shoe out there for the price, you give up a litle comfortability but they do what they are meant to do!"
241935,1,"Globe's Mojo shoes are by far the most comfortable, cushy pair I have ever worn. Been wearing them for at least three years and no complaints."
172495,1,"Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. They are beautiful, classy, comfortable and were at a great price."
206153,1,"I noticed that crocs shoes don't give my kids blisters on their feet.They seem to be a softer material than if you buy the cheapers ones at Target or Walmart.These crocs are great, an nice bright blue color, and really comfortable for my son.I will definitely purchase more in the future."
92882,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress. Furthermore, on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are. I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry. 5 stars from me."
264971,1,"I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
114011,1,My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and has a terrible problem with shoes. This shoe works very well for her. She wears a size 5WW which is very hard to find in shoe stores. I was able to get these on sale with Amazon's help. I couln't believe how quickly we received them... Great service....

115152,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
258252,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
376988,2,"Horrible shoes. Sucks, Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes"
4457,1,Had my first pair for seven years. Most comfortable shoes/boots I've ever found. Just a little too worn to look nice. I'll use them around the yard. Paid even less for the new pair than I did seven years ago. Thanks Amazon!
366762,1,"I decided to try these sandals as a possible replacement for the old Clark's Sunbeat, which no longer lives up to its former standard of quality, unfortunately. These have a very similar appearance and, if anything, are more comfortable. I thought I might dislike the look of the Velcro straps, but it's actually not very noticeable. They are very comfortable and, I thought, more attractive than they appeared in the picture (of course, I'm at an age where ""comfortable"" tends to be synonymous with ""attractive""). I downgraded them one star because the ankle strap tends to ride a little high on me, rubbing right underneath my ankle bone. I think when they get broken in and soften up a little, this will probably cease to be a problem, but for now, it's very irritating after awhile. Overall, though, I like this sandal and look forward to wearing it this summer."
376683,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
306070,1,"I had no idea what to expect from these sandals since I ad never heard of the brand before. But the reviews were mostly positive and the price sure was right. I'm glad I bought them. The cushioning is nice, and I like that it gives some decent arch support. That's something I need for high arches and most sandals are too flat to do anything.I've been able to wear these all day long with no issues."
66458,1,bought for my wife. very pleased. comfortable enough for her to dance all night. would recommend worth the money.
30457,0,"I have a difficult time finding comfortable Flip Flops for summer so I tried these. I found them to be uncomfortable because of the ridges in the insole (they agrevate the bottom of my feet). Most Flip Flops today have a smooth inner sole, but these specific sandles have some pretty rough ridges (I suppose to keep you from slipping). I have another pair of this same brand in a flowered insole pattern and they are a bit smoother and more comfortable. My other complaint is with the sizes. I would prefer if they did not combine sizes (example 8 to 9). It would be better if they offered some whole sizes."
71123,1,I love the stretcher as I need it to widen my right shoes. Good quality and works very well. Thanks so much
376841,1,"I got these boots for my daughter when she was 7 months old (in December), and she wore them all winter. Even in the cold Quebec winter they were able to keep her warm (they fit inside her snowsuit) without having to deal with socks. She never even wore socks until the following September! They are very convenient, wash really well and are an automatic baby gift for every baby I know!"
320591,1,"Maybe a little more than I wanted to spend, but in comparison to other dealers this price was great. Shoes fit well - I have very narrow feet and these fit the bill. They are comfortable and seem to work very well."
348834,1,The quality and price of these boots were great. I received the shipment very quickly. I would definately do business with this merchant again.
213402,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
321288,0,"These slippers were ok, but definitely run wide. In street shoes I wear a 10 or 10.5 and I often size up to an 11 in loafers or ballet flats to accomodate my slightly wide feet. I ordered a 10W since these slippers are not offered in an 11, and they were loose even with the drawstring completely tightened. I ended up exchanging for a pair of Blochs, which come in longer lengths."
14994,0,We bought these shoes for my daughter as a follow up to her first pediped soft soled shoes. We needed a little more protection and durability for walking outside.The soles are a very soft rubber and very flexible. I think they are great for beginning walkers. The only reason I gave these a 3 is because the leather on the ridges around the stitching scuffed badly and immediately. So they looked pretty tattered after just one wear.You can't beat the price though! All-in-all a good value.
333172,1,I ordered these boots in the cognac color. They look and feel great! I was a little worried about ordering these when I read the problems that some people were having putting them on and taking them off. I have had no trouble at all. They slipped right off and on. I did order a half size bigger like another customer suggested. This could have been the trick.
376455,1,"I own two of these wallets, one for everyday use, bulging with all my credit cards and stuff, and one for travel purposes that is not all stretched out - I don't take all my cards with me when I travel. You can't beat this for the price. The paper currency section is not sewed up on one side because these wallets were originally meant to hold Euros. They stopped sewing up the side so that paper dollars will fit. And they fit good enough and the velcro holds everything together. The velcro-closed change section is a greatly useful thing. I keep my St. Christopher medal in there and a couple of quarters in case my cell phone stops working and I need to make a phone call. I will continue to buy these useful wallets as my other wallets wear out. I recommend this wallet for men and women too."
95107,1,I bought these boots for my grandson. It seems that all the boys in his school are wearing them. They fit well and he loves them.
54738,1,"I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2, but that appeared to not be an option. I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size. I use extra inner soles & that helps, but I wish my size was available."
304833,0,"First, I have to say, I had a pair of heavy soled skechers boot before and wanted to replace them. These looked almost exactly like it but they weren't as heavy soled as I thought. Other than that disappointment, they are a good boot and well constructed. I just got so used to the heaviness and these seemed like slippers compared to it."
310901,1,"These are by far the best boots that I have ever owned. I have mine for 8 years and have worn them through New York winters each year. They run true to size and width and are totally waterproof. They are also stylish enough to wear with anything, including dresses and skirts. I am ordering a new pair now. I wish they came in brown or gray as well."
341030,1,i recommend anybody to buy a pair and plan on buying a second pair in the near future. awesome purchase
321809,1,"These are absolutely the most comfortable shoes I've ever had on my feet. My work environment requires me to be on my feet all day, but no tennis shoes. These take care of the problem beautifully."
351103,1,"As a new infantryman, many many years ago, I was advised by a NCO to save my money and purchase a pair. I bought them a few weeks later and being a new private decided to break them in on a two week FTX that ended with a 25 mile hike back to base. I should have painfully regretted that decision but I returned with nary a blister and a new found love for Mr. Danners wonderful boots. I kept the same pair for the entire 10 years and I'm sure thousands of miles, only having to resole them twice, and sold them when I ETS'd for 75.00 to a new private. Hands down the best money I have ever spent and I can't recommend them enough for anyone spending a large amount of time on their feet or walking."
113547,1,"Recieved a 1/2 size larger than I ordered..but love the shoes nonetheless. Suppose I could have returned them, but I will just wear thicker socks...quality as always by converse!"
61038,1,Great boots. Quick response. Will be ordering more. I have been wearing this product for many years and love them.
100975,1,Bought this for my daughter and she says is very confortable. The material looks like is going to last. I definately wil recommend it.
105121,0,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
72260,1,I bought these after searching for wide taps shoes for my daughter. She loves them! They are easy for her to put on and take off by herself. She says they are more comfortable than any other tap shoe she has had.
67820,1,beautiful and very comfortable!nice to get these shoes for Christmas.I bought them for a holiday in Jerusalem.I am very pleased)
289032,0,Why buy here when you can get the first pair at a Rockport outlet for $10 or more less and then a second pair for half off that lower price??Need to be careful. These days Amazon does not always offer the best value!
160472,1,The ordering process was easy. The wait was not long. The product was perfect!!!
304992,2,"My biggest problem with these, even though I'd really like to like them, is that I couldn't attach them to my socks (I bought the non-stirrup version)--obviously a very big problem with this product. While I had no problem with the length (I'm 6'3"") and no problem with attaching them to my shirt, I found it impossible, even after trying them on my thinnest dress socks and multiple different ways, to get them to attach, thus rendering them useless. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I can't think of any other possible way to do it if I am. A potentially fantastic product that I just can't use."
32624,1,Very cute! My 6 year old gets so many positive comments every time she wears them. Good quality. We both love them.
62696,2,"The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem. The shoes that arrived had been worn. I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had. He made a good offer however, I decided to wash the shoes and keep them, which I did. Now, I have an infection on my toe. Not good."
315734,1,I got the Shoe on time as was stated by the seller. It is a good product and I will recommend the shoe for my friends.
174609,1,"The shoes have always been the best for comfort,in my opinion. I have a knee problem and whenever I wear these particular shoes, my knees don't hurt as much."
151926,1,"The Traveltime is the most comfortable slip-on shoe I have ever worn. Have older pair of pink ones and wanted navy to wear with jeans. I also like to wear them in the house to exercise or walk around inside during Winter. Even forgot to change them to boots one evening, wore them out to casual dinner, and my feet didn't get cold! Amazon is the best on-line retailer. The shoes arrived 3 days after ordering."
105679,1,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
53934,0,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
137667,2,The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
33804,1,"A shoe that barely qualifies as such, which is what I wanted by the way. This is one of the best shoes for drumming I've ever worn. They're light, comfortable, the soles are so thin you can really feel the pedals, yet they're thick enough to give you protection. Anyone who's ever drummed in bare feet will know what I'm talking about. They almost feel like slippers and more importantly look cool especially if you're wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans, t-shirt and your name is ""something"" Ramone."
197787,1,Red chucks was all my 17 year old wanted for Christmas. We didn't thinkthey would make it in time. The did and my childs face was priceless!Thank you.
85438,0,"In twenty words or less, they are a good imitation but not the real thing.Otherwise they are a good slipper if you are looking for this kind."
345250,1,"If your lady has any sort of style and loves the color green, get here these shoes. My wife works in the restaurant buiz as a server and wore these shoes every night for over a year at work. She received so many complements on her shoes. They are really a rare style / color to see. Plus they are CHUCK T'S. They last. Get em', rock em', love em'."
280277,1,"I have worn Bass sandals for over 20 years,you can't go wrong buying a pair. The only thing is they seem to be very narrow in width (Maybe my feet are wider than they use to be)They do stretch a little so give them a few days to adjust to your feet. Other than that I still really like the sandal overall"
291289,1,"I have worn these slippers for years. They are comfortable, long lasting and came at a great price on Amazon. Will be purchasing these again once this pair wears out!"
12602,1,Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse.
374671,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
277486,1,"I hike fairly frequently in the Sierra mountains, often in rocky, steep or muddy terrains. So I spent a good amount of time researching for the best pair of boots that will provide and comfort and durability for an all-day hike. I finally decided on these Altitude IV boots.I was very pleased with my decision, as they were very comfy, no blisters, and durable, not to mention better looking than other hiking boots. Good grip over rocks, mud and dirt trails. I will buy another pair of Altitude IV after these wear out."
67955,0,Well after spending $85.00 on a pair of boots that were supposed to be a wide width I then had to take them to a shoe shop twice to have them stretched before I could even wear them.I will deffinately buy these kind of boots from in store before ordering online again. They were just so narrow they were almost going to go back but I decided to spend the extra dollars to have them stretched and thank god it worked or I would have been out alot of money. I suggest if you want to buy Timberlands go to a store and try them on first!!!
164455,1,These shoes are one of the most comfortable I have ever worn. They hold up very well. I have been buying them for years. It was great to find them on line because not every store carries them. I don't know why.
227469,1,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
349467,1,This pair of shoes he said feels like bedroom shoes he says they are so comfortable..
292434,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
133809,1,"I had knee surgeries on both knees in the 1970's when large segments of cartilage were removed compared to the minimally invasive surgery today. Because of this, I have to be very careful of the shoes I wear.What is required is a shoe with lots of padding and support. Wearing the Softspots Marathon allows me to have a pain-free day. If you have knee pain, you will not go wrong with the Marathon."
274724,0,"This is the second time I purchased these boots. The first time (7 years ago) everything was good. This time I gave the boots a 5 week break-in period but after two days on the trail I had some pinch points, but no blisters. The real disappointment was the waterproofing. Of the 5 days I was out on the trail I had 3 days of rain or overcast. On the first day after 5 hours of wet grass I had wet feet. I was hoping to keep my feet dry this trip."
171315,1,This product is very comfortable. It feels broke in the first time I put it on my feet. The color goes with many different outfits. I will suggest for someone to give me another pair for Christmas.
343376,1,"I purchased a pair of these shoes while on vacation in Virginia some eight years ago or so. I loved them; however, they finally just wore out. I searched for an identical pair and found them here on Amazon. These are identical to my original pair and I love them!"
352408,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
205439,1,Nice shoes! They are very stylish and comfy and I got them for a great price!
52585,1,"Great value and comfort. In fact, this is the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned. I will definitely purchase more prophet shoes. I have wide feet so I ordered EE width. I've never been more comfortable. Thank you Prophet!"
350971,1,"Years ago I realized the value of spending money for quality footwear. That said, shelling out over $300 on a pair of boots was not an easy choice! My last few pairs of boots (including 2 pairs of Magnums) failed me within 6 months, so I wanted something that was going to last a long time. I did a lot of reading and looking around online and kept coming back to the Danner Fort Lewis. Everyone who owned a pair raved about them, so I sucked it up and took the plunge. Great decision!I have bizarre feet. At 6'4"" tall, one would expect a size 12 or greater, but I wear an 8.5-9 EE. In addition to high arches, I have hammer toes, so I need room in places most shoes don't allow; hence I wear boots most of the time. When I got these in and put them on, I was a little nervous. They seemed to fit well, but there was some rubbing on my outside toes. 2 days of break in later and I was good to go. I've now worn them for 2.5 years in a variety of conditions, including motorcycling through massive down pours and on hikes through mud and muck with no problems at all. In fact, each time I polish them (which isn't often enough), they could almost pass for new! I've been surprised at how well the waterproofing has held up, as this is often one of the first things to go. I have never treated them and they still keep my feet dry, even when I stomp through puddles just to see my wife's look of exasperation.Since buying these, I've been in the Danner Outlet in Portland a few times and learned that these are still US made boots, which is cool. They tell me they remain on of their best sellers, especially with LEOs, and the only time they sell a second pair is when someone wants a dress pair. I can believe it, they really are remarkable. As with all boots, trying them on first is a good idea, but for wear and durability, you can't do better than these!"
178397,1,I was so happy with this purchase. I purchased this just days before Christmas. These came on time and were exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the great service.
128897,1,"I find these shoes to be very, very, comfortable. I received them in a prompt fashion and I would highly recommend them for warmth and comfort."
268677,1,"My favorite evolv shoe. I am a small woman and love the fit of these. Use it on sport, crack, trad...from Jtree to Flagstaff. 5.6 - 5.11 (maybe 5.12 soon).Just super comfortable and good on technical rock. Hope they never stop making them!

53488,1,"Keds Shoes are worth the money, i will buy again as long as the price does not go up, excellent"
251967,1,I have been buying this brand/style for many years. Good wear and comfort for my everyday casual use!
21665,0,Couldn't get my foot more than half way in. Liked the style very much but was not confident I would get the right size by reordering. Cost me ove 8 dollars to return the shoes.Easy Spirit Women's Motion Sport Lace Up/ camel
269241,1,"Great shoes, after a short break in these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Will buy again."
343052,0,"They were narrow, like European Shoes. Buy a wider width and a half-size larger. If you have a high instep, do not buy these. They are well made but not for me. I had no trouble returning them. The vendor was fine."
76876,1,"This is a Really nice looking shoe. I'm not a dancer and plan to keep these for work. Very soft and comfortable. Tight both in length and width but should loosen up a bit. Great heel, style and quality. Bottom of heel will need to be reinforced for street wear. At the bottom of the t-strap near your toes, the material wrinkles as your foot bends during walking. Good insoles, adjustable strap keeps the shoe snugly in place. Very happy with this purchase and high recommend."
165108,1,"I am always a little sceptic about buying shoes online, but these fit great, are original, and look good! I strongly recommend them."
69066,1,"I was so thrilled with the black shoes, I turned around and bought an orange pair. They satisfy the three most important requirements for me in a shoe; they are attractive, comfortable and well-made. The fact that I purchased them on sale was the icing on the cake. I highly recommend these shoes."
210874,1,"Like all Easy Spirit Shoes, these are great. Order arrived a few days after placing the order. High quality shoes at a great price."
148194,0,"These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
36760,1,Are so little and pretty (6M :p). The size are just right and the color is nice. All that I was expected.
85657,1,"As a daily runner and marathoner, I was in the market for a new pair of running shoes. I considered the Nike Shox, but after a few tries with them I decided to go the alternate route and picked up these new Adidas.Wow.The UltraRide blows away the Shox in terms of support, comfort, and stability. The ""cool"" factor is also very high with these shoes.Recommended over Shox"
182747,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for years, now. Whenever they start showing a little wear, I'm on the hunt for new ones. I'm so happy I found them again! They are very comfortable, look nice with most anything I wear. I always get compliments on them..... (even if they are a little worn)"
259176,0,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year. They were smaller than the 1.5 last year. Her true foot size is a 3. Nothing bad with the quality of the shoe but the sizing needs some work. If you need to order this shoe, size up 1 to 2 sizes."
137710,2,I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them. They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them. I will not purchase any Keds in the future.
88997,1,"If you've got a wide foot, forget this shoe. I have a narrow one and I find it tight - its very very stiff but hopefully just needs to be broken in... the workmanship is Rockport though, nice leather and stiff sole, more like a light hiking shoe than a casual walking shoe. Like the insert, though may need to remove it, if the shoe doesn't soften up.UPDATE: wore this travelling for four weeks and it was quite a good shoe. Comfortable, and it softened right up and yet maintained good foot support. Kept the insert in, find it quite cushy now. Happy with the purchase, esp. at this price point, it was a great investment."
158246,1,My teenager loves these Chuck Taylor's and he is so happy that he received them for his Christmas present.He says they are very comfortable and they look good with his skinny jeans too!Also a great price too.
172505,1,"I hesitated to order shoes, of all things, online; but these shoes are not only stylish, they are comfortable, too! I just love them! Nine West fits me well and because they are a platform, the arch is not too high making them very comfortable. Plus, these shoes were shipped very fast and I was able to enjoy them within days of ordering!"
3596,1,"i was hiking last sunday on the north east side of barbados, they protected my feet when i stepped the sea rocks along the shoreline.i used wear shoes and my feet are not longer wet i walked thru wet grass or i stepped into water.they are comfortable. i dont have worry about twristing my ankles no more or hurting my feet on jagged rocks.one hiking buddies stated that i must have on goat parts because he said, i was going very fast along the shoreline, sometime there was very little space for footing. i was going buy an other brand but when i saw them online, i wanted them! they are grrreeeaat!them light weight. before i bought the boots, i used wear a pair of running shoes and the rain comes or falls the night before! my feet would wet and will bring alot of discomforts to my feet but alas i have my htmaivwp hiking boots. they are great."
22364,1,"First time I tried on Clarks. Very nice looking shoe. Extremely comfortable right out of the box. Soft leather, padding below the ankles very soft. Only problem was the sizing is generous. Have to return the shoes but ordered one half size smaller. Liked them to much not to try again."
240152,1,"This checkbook cover is great! Great price, soft to the touch and fits nicely into my purse."
345184,1,"Very Fast! I had the item within 2 days of placing the order, color and size correct. I was very pleased with the service."

259491,1,"I love my Converse shoes. I know my size and I know that they will fit. Needless to say, when the shoes arrived they were in great condition! They fit. No problems and no need for a return or exchange."
43294,1,"The shoes were exactly what I ordered, brand new, and I couldn't have been happier with my purchase."
188810,1,"These shoes are comfortable for getting around. Since it is a mans shoes I normally order down one size. There were no tens so I ordered the 10.5. The shoe fit fine, the 10 would not have given me the same comfort. I would recommend this as a walking shoe."
10383,0,"This isn't the best ballet shoe I've ever had, but it's not the worst either. It's just pretty average. I wear a size 7.5 street shoe so I ordered a 7.5 for this shoe. The length is just a little short, but my ballet shoes always stretch after a while, so I think this will be fine. However, they're way too wide for my feet even with the strings tied as tight as I can get them. Also, the elastics are already sewn on even though the picture doesn't show them that way. I wish they weren't, because they're not exactly in the right place for me. The shoes are made in Thailand for those interested in country of origin. They're an ok shoe, but I won't get them again when these wear out because the sizing is too awkward and the elastics are pre-sewn."
268042,2,"I have worn Dansko's for over 20 years and never had any problems. They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost. In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly. It is like the soles just disintergrated. I store my shoes in boxes w/ silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated. I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly. I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also. I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this ""dryrot"" issue to occur."
294995,1,"I love these. These are my favorite sandals now. I have trouble with my one arch, and these give good support. The shoe is well made and classy. You can dress it up or it looks great with jeans or shorts too. Wise choice!!"
164558,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
231343,1,"Very happy with these boots. Super warm, snow collar helps keep feet dry when plowing through stuff well up on the knee. Strap adds some decent ankle support when scuffing around on uneven/slippery surfaces. Were comfortable right out of the box and so far have had absolutely no leakage. About the only minor complaint I could make is that they are a little tedious to lace up as the laces bind at each eyelit - have to tighten up one set of eyelits at a time."

99339,1,"I bought a pair of these same shoes 10 years ago and have worn them as my ""at home"" shoes when I had to dress more formally at work. When I am able to dress down at work, I wear these. These shoes are so comfortable, flexible and fit very well. I hope Nunn Bush never stops making them. I just bought a new pair because my old ones have worn soles, but the tops are still fine and my old pair are now my cabin shoes. I am considering buying another pair just in case they might stop making these. I rub some shoe oil on them once a year and some light wax in the winter time. Thank you Nunn Bush."
49555,1,This thong is great for summer and/or at the beach. Very comfortable but runs a 1/2 size smaller. I wear a regular 8M but had to order a 1/2 size larger for perfect fitting.
11488,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress. Furthermore, on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are. I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry. 5 stars from me."
43811,1,"I have a few pairs of Danskos and they have really made a difference in my lifestyle. Walking in New York for more than two or three blocks used to be torture (hard pavement, uneven sidewalks, the snow, the broken bits). Now I can step out of my office and go for a 20/30 blocks walk without a doubt, since this shoes are extremely comfortable and resistant, and quite durable. Ideal for holidays when you expect to walk a lot, too. I have the clogs and also a couple of sandal pairs. BE ADVISED that the fit in this shoes is not like other shoes: you should try to buy your first pair at a shop where the assistant will measure your foot and suggest an adequate fit. I normally wear a 39.5 Medium, and I wear a 42 clog and a 41 sandal in DANSKOS. So try them the first time, before deciding to buy, and you should be just fine."
55620,1,"When I was growing up, my Floridian grandmother only wore one kind of shoe that I can remember: Keds. They were white, always so perfectly white, and as a fragile older woman, she could walk on her feet for days and not complain once. I can't say that it wasn't for all of the exercise classes she took in the pool at her apartment, or living directly on the boardwalk, but she never seemed to complain about her feet hurting.So why am I reminiscing about a shoe? Well, as an 18-year-old who believes she has somewhat of a fashion sense, I recently purchased a pair of black Champion Basic Canvas Lace-Up Keds through Amazon.com. I had always been more of a Converse shoe person, but with more straight-leg/boot-leg jeans in style, a size 10 Converse looks a lot bigger than it needs to. So, I went out on a limb and ordered the Keds. I must admit that they were hard to take off. It didn't really seem to matter to me that there were 4 inches of snow outside or that I was supposed to be wearing my new boots. Nope, it didn't matter to me.What I'm really trying to say here is that these Keds are by far one of the best purchases I have made in my ""adult"" life. They were cheap, about half the price of Converse, extremely comfortable, and [at least I believe] are pretty stylish. Although I'd probably never purchase the white ones, as they would remind me too much of my grandmother, any other color is great."
144942,1,Very happy with my uggs. They arrived quickly and are perfect. Comfy and great as expected. Very satisfied customer. Thanks
247281,1,My brother-in-law had a different slipper on his Christmas wish list that did not have good reviews so I looked for something like it but better and found this slipper. They were on his feet the minute he opened them. He has great taste and likes very nice things and these slippers fit the bill perfectly.
298859,1,"I got this particular pair of crocs for my granny. I thought she'd love to wear them in the country house. She liked the shoes a lot, especially the fact that they are so light-weight. & she loved the butter color too, it looks exactly like the color on the picture. All in all crocs are super comfy, although granny finds them a bit too broad. But I'm thinking about getting a pair for myself:)"
141969,1,"These Keds are everything the seller described. Size runs true to form, they are extremely comfortable and look great!"
382830,1,I bought these to replace another pair of aerosoles that I was wearing. They are very comfortable and did not disappoint. I would recommend to anyone. The size was spot on.
26385,1,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
156012,1,Bought the shoes to wear to work on those days when I don't need dress shoes and when I know that I will do a lot of walking. The shoes are very comfortable and are a great fit. I would recommend them to anyone.
221229,1,"As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present ""one size fits all,""it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands. These shoesare well made and an excellent value. The only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case."
44141,2,PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
132741,0,"I ordered these to wear while shoveling and to take walks in the snow. They are very warm and soft, but have no sort of support for your foot/arch. I wear a size 11 women's shoe and these boots slop around on my feet. I wear 2 thick pairs of socks and that helps, but they are still to big. I have one that the zipper likes to stick, but over all they do what boots are suppose to do...keep my feet dry and warm and only for $18!!!"
377876,0,Nothing to really write home about. The boots seems to be built tough and look alright. Maybe have that slight hazey pinkish look to them as some tan boots do when they are new. I bought these to redeploy in due to the fact that the higher ups wants us to look clean and nice.
80196,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
33859,1,"Converse All-Stars are the all-American shoe, and the black monochrome goes with everything. Seriously; I've worn these to the opera."
133077,1,I can never get enough of Rainbow Sandals. I bought one for me and my boyfriend because it was about time to retire our old ones.
365275,1,Great product! I bought them for my power lifing training and they are great so far!
339539,1,The color is amazing! If you wear any Brown Tees this is the must have shoe!
287764,1,Bought these on sale during December. Even with shipping costs to Canada it was a good deal. The fit was great. I normally wear a size 9 shoe and these were the same. Good quality zippers that don't slip when zipped. Would not recommend for long walks but they are great durable boots that can be worn to the office and around town.
27737,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
88905,1,"I wanted something current and interesting. I have had knee replacement and needed a 2"" heel only. Not only was this shoe perfect it is amazingly comfortable. It looks great on too! Mission accomplished. Oh and not to forget the very affordable price!"
302220,1,"No, I am not out on a cross country ""Walk for Peace"" but when I wear these shoes every step I take promotes World Peace. I have a red pair of peace shoes and I bought my mom a pair of pink ones. We love wearing them out together - we are a Mother/Daughter team making a double statement! Also, we get many comments - whether together or alone. People just love them! I wish I had these Peace shoes in 3 or 4 other colors."
191807,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
12191,1,I Loved The Right From The Start.I Bought Them In White Color And They Are Beautiful.I'm Planning To Buy More In The Near Future.
176097,1,"Love these sandals! I've had three pairs of this style, and don't want to be without them in the summer. They""re very comfortable, and look good with dresses or shorts."
114929,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
277733,1,"I'm really, really happy with these boots. An awesome price for a super-sturdy piece of footwear that seems like it's going to last a really long time. I needed footwear that would support my ankles, for both every day walking and hitting the hills with my dogs. These fit the bill.Why buy a second pair?Two reasons:1) I'm paranoid the price will go up.2) These are nice enough to wear out into the real world, and I didn't want to have to worry about keeping my daily pair ""nice"".The biggest problem for me? They do require some breaking in and for me, it was kind of a painful process. They are rigid, strong boots, and they do give way eventually. Already, after only a few months, my first pair are taking on that nice patina that well-worn leather boots get.It makes me said that I'll have to go through that process again with my second pair, which will take longer because they will be worn less frequently."
200400,1,"Great shoes, look just like the picture.Only downside is if you wear the shoes like you're supposed to (without socks) the leather insole will wear out rather quickly."
146087,1,"I LOVE these boots. They came on time and I have no complaints about these boots, the packing, or the seller. I love them and I wear them often...I will be purchasing another pair via amazon very soon."
291241,0,The satin and fabric and cushioning are all very nice. They keep my feet nice and warm but the elastic in the bag DIGS into my heel! I wear a size 8 - I bought a large which is supposed to fit between a 8 - 9 and there is plenty of room for my foot but the elastic in the back is just too constricting! If they eliminated this it would be the perfect slipper!
223485,1,This was perfect.. It was true to size brand New as suspected and I would recommend this product to anyone
138896,1,The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape. They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct.
74052,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
242323,1,Thank you for excellent service and quick shipping. Even with shipping it cost me less for these shoes than atmy local mall.
95800,1,"I bought this leather ""Man Bag"" for my husband as an anniversary gift. He needed something that could allow him to carry his wallet, glasses, cell phone, check book, etc. This ""Man Bag"" does just that and it isn't obtrusive. The only thing I would change about the product, would be to have a thicker strap on it."
148839,1,"The first time I saw a pair of Superstars was 8 years ago and I thought they were the coolest looking all-purpose shoes I had ever seen. I immediately went out and bought my first pair and haven't been without at least 2 styles ever since. Classic, simple, comfortable, and durable, they have never failed me whether at work (I'm a Fed Ex courier) or play. The break in period is almost non-existent and best of all, the sole wears out before the upper leather portion wears out. For the price and dependability, you cannot lose with this shoe!"
42247,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
364580,1,No complaints for this gift. They get worn a lot and so need to be replaced occasionally.
192779,1,"My daughter loves her shoes. We all have this type of shoe, and they can wear the anywhere. Very versatile and comfortable. It works with their active feet."
337688,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
240574,1,"Most comfortable and good looking classic sneakers on the market for unbeatable price. I have already bought a second pair cause am wearing them everyday. Do not get me wrong, they are durable I just wanna have one dry extra pair for exchange.Be careful with sizes, ezample my regular size is US 11 1/2 for 90% of shoes am wearing, but all Onitsuka shoes fits 1/2 size down som wearing US 11."
146133,1,Christmas gift for my daughter. She got to open them early and she looooooves them!! Shipping was quick and no worries about the Uggs being authentic!
46480,0,"I thought I was ordering the Pedini Femme, which has no buckle. too confusing and I have returned this one to order the Femme version. I'm sure it is a fine shoe, but knowing there was a big difference in the Pedini's would have been nice to know up front.thanks."
184000,0,"I purchased the Emerald Dansko Women's Professional Box leather clog because of its good looks and Dansko's good reputation with the hospital crowd.Unfortunately, I have a small bunion and the clog was torture to wear on the troublesome foot.Bottomline, beware of this clog if you have a bunion!"
166204,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
250090,0,"I bought these shoes for a vacation to Costa Rica where it frequently rains. When I put the shoe on it clung nicely to my feet, and I was hoping it would be enough to keep water from pouring in. It doesn't and once this sucker fills up with water, it's over! Also, my foot got EXTREMELY hot, there is no breathing in this shoe. With that said, I think for cold rainy days when I won't be subject to sloshing through deep water, these will be great. If you want them for traipsing through the rainforest and wading in puddles, get some waterproof socks (or go bare inside shoe) and some mesh drainable shoes like solomon tech amphibians, or my favorites, New Balance SW920's. With those shoes you expect to get drenched and will appreciate the water draining out and nice comfort too."
189526,2,"I was wanting some red shoes for an upcomming event and these seemed perfect. The website showed a red smooth patent leather shoe and I loved the heel heigth. However, when the shoes arrived they were rough in texture, not patent leather. I would have been ok with them if they had been the red croc skin ones also avaiable, but they were neither of the red shoes shown on the site. I was extremely dissapointed, so I have returned the shoes. Amazon was quick to refund the money, but I had to quickly look elsewhere to find the red patent leather shoes I had thought I was receiving from Amazon. The heel heigth and the Berry style look great, but not in the color and texture I received. Don't trust the picture, because it is extremely missleading."
154336,1,I have worn these shoes for about 15 years. I just purchased my third pair. They are comfortable and have a good arch support. I am on my feet in my job for about 12 hours a day and have no foot problems and I would like to think it is because of these shoes. I was so happy to see amazon had them in stock as the local store where I bought the first 2 pair had shut down. Amazon even had them for 50$ less. Received them in a very timely manner too. Thanks Amazon!!
7916,1,Very please with my boots .I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish .Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
36603,1,"I ordered a pair of these boots last week, When they came I was disappointed in the quality of one boot's leather, which was very thin, more like glove leather than boot leather. I am reticent to return items and for fifty years I never did. However, something priced over $200 seems a good candidate for a return if it doesn't meet expectations.I shipped the floppy-leather pair back to Amazon myself. I might say please take advantage of their UPS pickup option as the price to ship them yourself is way above the reimbursement you will receive. The return was received yesterday and the new boots arrived today.One thing I immediately noted about the new pair versus the old is that the new came wrapped in tissue paper, with several inspectors tags in the box and with a product tag zip-tied to the boot. The other pair had none of these, which confirmed my suspicion that I'd received someone else's return the first time.The quality of these new boots is much better than those of the previous pair, more like the Danners that I've worn since the I was discharged from the army in 1980. They still don't seem quite as heavy as the old-timey Danners but this is to be expected because the company is making boots advertised to have no break-in period. Right out of the box, they are soft and comfortable and my 10-year-old Danners are quite jealous of their bright new look."
263829,1,"""Chucks"" are the only shoes that have ever existed. Ever since 1923, Chuck Taylor All-Stars have been ""just a piece of rubber and canvas""- they haven't changed one bit from the sands of time. These shoes are devilishly simple, and customizable in every way. Everyone may be wearing Chucks these days, but you can still make them your own. There are so many ways- what color would you like? One of the core colors- black and white? Monochrome black? White? Red? Green? Blue? Pink? How about the latest pattern or print? Every year Converse also pumps out new seasonal colors, and different styles such as double-tongued shoes, ""tear-aways"", faded looking ones, everything. You can buy different color laces or you can go crazy with a Sharpie and draw up some art all over your shoes. And for something seemingly so flimsy, they're pretty durable. My shoes have withstood countless running and hitting the asphalt, games of soccer, basketball, jumping from everywhere, the basic abuse a teen can dish out to his feet. Granted, they may not be too comfortable at first, but once your feet gets used to them, well, you don't even notice you're wearing them anymore. Nevertheless, it does have some setbacks, but if you look at modern shoes, you can see the differences in design. But for something from over 3/4 of a century ago, you've got to admit they're pretty darn impressive. The skinny:PROS-customizable in any way- laces can be easily replaced and be done up in any pattern you wish-look great with anything and everything; the unisex casual sneaker that will even draw you the occasional compliment from coworkers or friends.-lightweight compared to most shoes of today-so many colors- from your basic core colors (black, red, green, blue, white, or pink) to different designs (60s tie dye, camo, skulls, flames, etc.)-also different kinds of shoes- from the classics to the newer double uppers, tear-aways (shoes with two layers of canvas, and some parts are already torn away to show the brighter underlayer), double-tongued, and also DIFFERENT MATERIALS like leather or suede.CONS-the color fades; especially in the harsh sun. My navy blue Taylors have been bleached to the color of very faded blue denim.-the rubber parts of the shoe can get dirty rather quickly, but are easily cleanable.-overall the shoe is pretty comfortable, but not recommended for prolonged running or a whole day on the boardwalk. It depends a lot on the shape of your foot- if your feet are flat, you'll find that these shoes are a match made in heaven. Otherwise you may have some issues, but not so bad they're unwearable.-I don't know what it is about it, but they make your feet look bigger than they really are.-NOT TO BE USED AS A SKATE SHOE. Converse shoes are made from canvas, which won't give you any mercy from runaway boards, and they do NOT have adequate cushioning on the top, bottom, or sides for such an activity.NOTE: BUY A HALF-SIZE SMALLER THAN WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR. A Converse size 10 is, in reality, a 10 1/2.ANOTHER NOTE: If this bothers you, then you should know. Chucks are no longer manufactured in the USA. They are now outsourced to other countries, mostly China. Your Chucks won't be falling apart on you or anything, but know that Converse is now a subsidiary of Nike, a company known to use sweatshop labor to make their shoes."
255679,1,I have ordered my son two pairs of these shoes. Good quality and the size is accurate. Will order in a larger size soon.
86747,1,I love my shoes. They are comfortable and stylish. They are going to be the perfect little white tennies for the summer.
3083,1,"I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
232466,1,I own 6 pairs of these shoes in different colors. They are classic flats! I wear them to work and for both casual and semi-formal events. You simply cannot beat them for comfort and style!
10931,1,"Recently retired, and looking for comfortable attractive shoes. These are great."
273251,1,"I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise). They are beautiful and comfortable (I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon.com!"
37358,1,I was looking for these for a while and the price was great. They arrived quickly as well.
251712,1,Very stylish and well-built. Super-comfy from Day One. I've been wearing them nearly every day for the past few weeks.
267481,1,This was the best out there for the money. Bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. Very water proof after playing in the snow with the kids...
227843,1,"I purchased these shoes for my boyfriend because we couldn't find any large enough for his feet in stores. He loves them and wears them all the time! The only thing I might change about my purchase is the shipping. We had to have them by a specific date and yes they were here on time, it was nerve racking wondering if the standard ship would be sufficient. Overall excellent purchase!"
30239,1,Just a line to say how comfortable these shoes are. Anyone who has ever put ECCO shoes on their feet know this to be true. I am truly singing to the choir but to those that are considering a purchase of ECCO shoes...do it! You owe it to yourself and your feet!
332278,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
193993,1,"Im a Flight Nurse, so I work in EMS. These boots were extremely comfortable from day one. They are my favorite boots Ive owned so far. Ive had Bates, Rockies, Oakleys....these are the best. I think I would order 1/2 size smaller next time, there are a tad bit large, but my foot doesnt slip. Also, I meant to order side zippers, but these boots slip on and off very quickly so Im not slowed down in the middle of the night."
84167,1,"Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine since 2002 I dont skate so much but I love the style, this shoes was a little bit bigger but it's ok..good choise VANS OLD SCHOOL"
148339,1,"I bought these from Cutesy Shoes back in the spring and they are soooo cute! A little retro, a little Jackie O, and they'll easily dress up any outfit. One of the best features on the shoes, in my opinion, is the fact that the back strap has elastic on one side so the skinny slingback doesn't dig into the back of my heel -- there's a lot of give and I don't feel too restricted in them.Just to toot Cutesy's horn for a second: she has the hottest styles & colors at THE best price. We all have our high-end, expensive, designer-like shoes that we love, but at the same time, we like to be able to afford several pairs of cute & trendy, lesser expensive shoes. I always check out Cutesy's eBay store to find those styles that are so hot at an uber-affordable price! And the quality is still there! LOVE CUTESY!!!"
235321,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
114069,1,I have wide feet and to top it off an annoying hammer toe. This is the second pair I ordered. Very comfortable.
21467,1,"My son loves to be a cowboy. He can't wait to go back to Wild West City for our annual trip. He wanted a new pair of cowboy boots, and even at 9. many stores consider his foot size to be that of a man. Locally, a pair of cowboy boots for him may have cost me over $100. We decided to look online. We found a pair that was reasonable and ordered them. Everyday he anxiously awaited his purchase. They arrived in the amount of time promised. He was so excited when he opened the box and they were all they said they would be. He was absolutely thrilled and they immediately went on his feet and the fit was excellent (I ordered them 1 to 1/2 size larger than what he is wearing so that he will have room and not outgrow them immediately). The styling is really nice and the quality great. What a deal!"
329274,1,I bought these sandals for my daughter. They are flip flops with a arch. They are very comfortable. The dark color hides the dirt. I would buy these again.
81101,1,i have had these flip flops a year or so now and they are super comfy and still arent worn down. love them and would order them again.
304222,0,I bought these shoes because I have foot problems and my doc said they could help me walk better. They really did- for about 2 months. They stretched out quite a bit and no longer gave the support I needed. That's not good enough for the price. Now I am looking for something better.
302135,1,"These shoes are what I was looking for..but, they do run a little big. So be sure to get a size down from your regular size. I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe..They are comfortable and you cant beat the price..shipping was pretty face as well."
361783,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
102979,1,I bought two pairs of water shoes for my toddler & these were so much nicer than the other pair. These left no marks on her heals & stayed on with no problems. I was very happy that these shoes worked since the 1st pair I bought were a flop.
332750,1,I was careless jogging down a boat ramp.My attention was diverted.My croc Beach Clog changed ownership to a dock cleat !!!
323465,0,"Sandals look good, but they run one and a half sizes too small; and a bit narrow."
98463,1,"I purchased the shoes one week before my volleyball tournament and was little bit worried that I will need little bit more time to break them in before playing 7 hours non-stop game. I was amazed how soft and comfortable these shoes were the first time I put them on - like I had them for ever. The fit around the heel area is not loose = not allowing the heal to go up and down which is great especially for me with skinny feet. The front is little bit more roomy but again I have very skinny feet so should not be a problem for others.The performance is great, nicely balanced and cushioned so even when playing on a very hard surface the impact on joints and spine is minimal.Design is nice for volleyball shoes even I know that running shoes looks much sexier on women :-) LOL."
136468,1,"This review is very deserving of 5 stars. My boyfriend needed a new pair of chucks for work that matched his uniform... we don't wear many other types of shoes.. Love chuck taylors! 5 stars for fast shipping, and low price. Thanks!"
291362,1,"For me, the Isotoner Classic slippers are the perfect slippers to wear around the house. Although I don&#8217;t wear them outside very often, they have an indoor/outdoor sole. They are comfortable and keep my feet warm.One of the best things is that they are machine washable if they get dirty. I have several pairs so I always have a clean pair available. I have Isotoner slippers in terry and satin, but the satin is my favorite.When they are on sale, the value is even better.Note: they run slightly small so if your shoe size is on the border, it is best to get the next larger size."
13423,1,"Just what I expected. Awesome. I wear a 11.5 in most shoes and got a 12 here on purpose so I could wear thick winter socks. Even with the socks they are a bit roomy in the toe- so believe that &#34;run a half size large&#34; thing for Converse i guess. Other than that, this Pair of Chucks are exactly right on."
303063,1,I like the shoes. I have had 2 other pair of shoes of the same product/shoe and they fit great. Until I went to a professional shoe fitting store I would have never bought K-swiss. My view of them was one of a more trendy/young persons shoe. The salesman suggested the shoe and when I tried it on I was very pleased.With the pair I just bought the one thing I noticed is it appears to have sat on a shelf for a long time. The material around the heel feels rough and dried out compared to my other shoes.
349811,0,"When I originally bought this sandal I loved it. I was looking for a flat,casual ankle wrap sandal. It was fine for the first couple of wears. But after about three weeks the heel cracked and started falling apart. I am really disappointed."
25528,1,"I had the originals back in grammar school in 1969 & always loved them.I have gained weight in the ensuing years & needed a very supportive shoe, so I looked into these again.This is a great shoe with lots of support for very overweight people, & highly recommended for them."
286667,1,"They are exactly as shown. Excellent and comfortable boot. Hard for me to get on/off because I have high arches, but otherwise they fit excellent. A good boot, no doubt about it."
245098,1,"I've been wearing Skechers's Alley Cats for 5 years now, I haven't worn a different shoe on a regular basis since, If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Alley Cats provide the comfortability I need throughout the day, and the style and design are awesome and rugged. For me, nothing beats a pair of alley cats to wear all day long. I wear them almost every single day and they don't start to tear or rip until minimum a year later. Great value for the money !"
221719,1,My GF loved them so that is good enough for me. They fit true to size. Comfortable. Warm enough for winter.
218821,1,love these shoes. no trouble with purchase. fit just perfect. love these shoes. love this brand. love this color. love
274625,0,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
173409,2,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
351828,1,"As a person with an over-pronation issue, this shoe gives me excellent support. I am on my second pair and find them to be durable. You can't beat Amazon.com's price either!"
161536,1,"They're Chuck Taylor's. If you'll like them, you'll love these. Black high-top sneakers were a great gift for the scene girl with black everything"
210251,1,"I love these shoes,it is one of the most comfortable heels, they are made &#8203;&#8203;of soft leather. I would recommend these shoes, the leg looks good in them, and they are very comfortable."
351533,1,"Very good trail shoes. Light, well cushioned neutral shoe. Addidas has made this shoe for some time now and with each update to it they have improved it. Great shoe value for the advid runner."
9205,2,"I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time, but needed to replace. I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality. I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart. They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take. I will be replacing these, but will not purchase another Keds shoe."
32281,1,They have changed inside of the shoe since the last time I purchased it.It has more padding and is more comfortable. I have worn out several pairs of this style.
360817,0,"I like the shoe--takes time to break in so shoe begins to fit the mold of your foot, like all Capezios. Comfortable. Really bought this shoe for everyday wear, since I like taupe to elongate your leg and foot. Makes you feel like a dancer!"
257912,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
161043,1,"I used to have a pair of Chuck Taylor's as a kid (and that was a while ago) as great cheap knock around shoes. Price has gone up a fair bit, but these monochrome shoes look great; classic styling, updated a bit.One small caveat; these shoes have little internal padding and have a lot more room inside than normal software in the same size. The retailer I purchased from mentioned they are about a 1/2 size larger than other shoes."
25658,1,These shoes are very well made and one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned. I plan to purchase another pair in another color.
136919,1,"muy buen producto y muy buen vendedor, todo me salio como yo esperava y hasta ahora todo esta muy bien."
16047,1,"love these boots. the tread design is well placed, and very functional. the heel doesnt rub my ankle wrong. i like the material as it allows for a good touch."
30601,1,this was an awesome deal for me. i was contempating purchasing them from the exact same seller on e-bay for 30 dollars more. i couls not believe my eyes when i saw the price on amazon.
355321,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
23797,1,"This is a great Reef sandle, I think the bottle opener is kind of funnie. It sure would be, last resort for me, to open a bottle from there. LOL"
256866,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
134726,1,"These boots are comfy, easy to tie and you can really wear them for all seasons. I live in New England and wear them to school every day."
353368,1,"my husband loves his slippers! Beautiful, perfect fit and wonderfully warm. What more can a person say about them? ok"
29184,1,I was delighted to find these sandals very comfortable and at a great price. I have a hard foot to fit and they were perfect.
50860,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
309509,1,The footbed in these sandals are the best I have ever worn. They fit true to size and last a long time. I have had a pair for a year and they are still in good shape. I bought these so I would have a black pair. I will continue to purchase the Mephisto brand for the comfort. I have heel spurs and they don't bother me when wearing these sandals. I would highly recommend them.
11814,1,"I love this shoe. It's dressy, but casual enough for every day summer wear, and it's comfortable for walking around every day. I bought one years ago at a retail store, then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and couldn't find anything else that came close. I found these here, and ordered the same ones I had before, and am very happy about it. Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6!"
201227,1,I shopped everywhere for a men's size 7 for my 13 year old grandson and I was even told they didn't make it. I'm glad I tried online. These are perfect and a great price with free shipping.
296412,1,Good value for the money. The soles provide more support than I anticipated. The only drawback is that they are definitely not as stylish as I had hoped.
99283,1,Outstanding shoes! Just like I remembered from high school years ago. I was glad to see them make a comeback and the price is great too.
154127,1,I love these shoes.. they are so comfortable the padding on the inside is excellent. They fit me true to size I am a 7.5 and the 7.5 fit great! LOVE these shoes!!
349383,1,"These shoes look awesome. They are a little snug at first but after a ""breaking in"" they feel really light and comfortable. Did I mention they look awesome???"
346943,0,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
157387,0,"The slippers out of the box seemed pretty good quality. unfortunately the hole for your foot was rather small,couldn't get my size 12 in there, so I gave them for Xmas to someone with a smaller foot"
44837,1,"These shoes fit, are pretty and the price is great! I feel like I got a great deal. I don't have any extra money or I would buy two more pairs. Another in black and one in beige. I bought them for dance class but would like a pair for dressing up."
172722,0,"alright fit just a little too narrow,i am hoping with wear they will stretch out. other than that, the product arrived on time as Amazon stated. I purchase clothes shoes, house hold products on amazon and recommend amazon to everyone."
154298,1,My 4 year old loves these shoes and he wears them almost everyday. They look very nice and my soon puts them without any help. They fit true to size. I would recommend these shoes to anyone.
279837,1,"Timberland 50061 Newbuck Chukka is the same as this black chukka. This is THE most comfortable and lightweight all around no BS boot I've ever worn. There's no Thinsulate but it is very water ""Proof"" I'm sure you don't want to walk into a pool with them but again, they are great boots Make sure you get the 50061 they have a lighter sole than the other Timberland boots less ""Beefy"" I use them for work and for the gym as well. Just all around the best boots I've ever worn. For Deep snow I would say get an 8' at least boot but for hiking, gym, work from CA to NY the 50061 is great. The new buck gets dirty fast so get 2 pair. One for beating on and one for going out ""styling"" if you will. Again, very light weight, true to size can't beat em for under $100.00. Great for landscaping, hunting, you name it. If you need severe cold weather you may try something with an Insulate if not these are the best boots ever made. The Black model is a different # but exactly the same just in Black Leather."
383660,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
3464,1,"I just bought these to use in the woods to play paintball, but also for general yard work, shoveling snow, etc. They weren't too hot, and give good support. I didn't test out their waterproof-ness, but I am happy with these boots for the price."
278580,0,"I purchased a pair of these in size 14 Wide. The boots I received were labeled as wide. They fit like mediums though. If you have a regular foot width, I am sure these boots are good because my wife owns a pair in regular width and she likes them."
148326,2,"I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past; however, the description on Amazon is incorrect. This is NOT a 3 pair pack, it is only one pair of socks for $13.99 plus shipping. What a rip-off. I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack"
108420,1,The boot was durable and lasted me through 12 weeks in the field with military training. I would suggest buying this boot a half size smaller.
79633,1,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
374984,1,"I have used these boots while hunting caribou,moose and elk. My feet were always comfortable no matter if I were in the snow on a mountian or in a bog. They were also comfortable at the fire station."
50660,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
308082,1,I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes!
332395,1,Right shoe was slightly tighter than the left. Used mink oil to relax the leather and placed shoe trees in them afterwards and it helped with the fit. Good shoe for casual or business look. Great value purchase!
88850,1,"It broke my heart to have to return them cause they are good quality and very comfortable, but the size is just a half size too large."
355294,1,I bought these as a gift for my son. The sizing was spot on. He loves them. They are apparently very popular nowadays!
36821,0,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
91991,1,This show was a great buy. Timberland makes a great product and to find it in a size 15 for under $60 is amazing. The two-tone style purchased looks nice in the larger size.
232121,1,"I never owned a pair of Adidas before and I really regret that. I picked up a white pair a year ago and liked it so much I immediately bought a second pair in black. These are without doubt the best casual shoes I've ever had, I'll always be wearing them. If I found out this line was being discontinued, I would buy a dozen pairs. They're casual and semi-sleek and very comfortable. I have narrow feet and they fit very well. I also walk around a whole lot, and these shoes are hardly worse for the wear.They do look a little distinctive with the three Adidas lines proudly displayed alongside...I prefer unlabeled clothing. Still a five star shoe."
236205,0,"Boots served me very well for about two years of occasional light (weekend) hiking and wintertime wear. But after this period, they started falling apart, with the upper splitting and tearing right at the sole line, stitching letting go, etc. Per the recommendation on Columbia's warranty page, I sent in photos of the failure, and of the sole (documenting the very light usage they had received), to see if they might offer a repair or credit towards new boots or something. Was informed that since the boots were out of warranty, they would do nothing.These were the fifth pair of midweight hiking boots I've bought since I was a teenager, all of similar weight and stiffness. All other brands (Timberland, Asolo, EMS, Vasque) have lasted until I wore the lugs off the soles (five years at least) and have survived much more abuse than these boots did. I'll give them three stars for their good comfort, support and water resistance, but given the short service life and Columbia's lack of concern about it, they get no more stars than that, and I won't be buying any Columbia boots in the future."
223287,1,I have bought these shoes for a while now. I work on my feet 10 hours a day as a Front Desk Manager and need comfybut dressy shoes. I always keep a black and a brown pair on hand and they last at least one to two years. I never had any tear up just wore down the soles from use over time. Love these shoes!
22076,1,"My mother-in-law has so much trouble finding comfortable shoes Between diabetes & problems that should be surgically corrected, but her high blood pressure prohibits surgery, finding shoes is like the proverbial needle in a hay stack search. Aetrex offered a full grain leather comfort shoe with velcro closures for easy adjustment. One look & I thought,""That's the shoe for Mom!""...and it was! She put them on, grabbed her cane, & wore them for her weekly shopping outing, & kept them on when we arrived back home. Amazing!!! Thanks, Amazon, for leading me in the right direction, & thanks to Aetrex, also, for solving the comfort dilemma!"
130208,1,"A fantastically comfortable boot, well put together and gives a sense that they will out last their owner! Outer packaging was a little damaged on delivery but all internal boxing and goods were in great order.Have all ready recommended the boots to friends."
201882,0,I like the shoes but the black around the ankles comes off onto my hands and feet. No matter what i did it just kept coming off. Then the zipper began to rip up the back of my legs after just a few minutes of wearing them. I would not buy shoes from this company again but loved their other items. would of lowered the stars but wouldnt let me. Throwing out the shoes.
42676,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
316884,1,"This shoe looks awesome and once its broke in feels great. I got a blister breaking them in, first time ever in a New Blance shoe."
382570,1,"These are the most comfortable sandals in the world. My wife only wears this type, and she wears them out. I should buy multiple pair at a time, but one pair every year ain't bad. Amazon has the best price compared to spending almost twice in a retail store. Thanks for the fast shipping!"
226231,1,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
220673,1,"I bought these boots to wear at my job on a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. My employer supplies us with boots (mostly Red Wing) but the boots that they order in my size (11 EEE) don't fit properly.These boots are working fantastically. Walking around for 12 hours per day, 21 days in a row on a steel deck can be murder on anyone's feet. These boots are very comfortable. The only thing I will probably have to do is get a different set of insoles. I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis in my left foot, and after several hours of use my foot does start to get sore.I would definitely recommend these boots. And being made in the USA rather than China is icing on the cake!"
315148,0,"They look good and go well with different clothing styles. Also comfortable. However, I expected them to be warmer. My feet were still freezing when I used the boots out in extreme cold weather (~ 0*F)."
97216,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
162031,1,"These all black Chuck's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online. They shipped in a timely fashion. Great Kicks, good deal."
119768,1,"Product was just as advertised. Only concern was that I did not receive a tracking number so I had no idea when exactly it would arrive. Other than that, great seller =)"
73608,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
207394,0,I still like the look of these shoes but was disappointed in the quality of the materials and workmanship (relative to an earlier pair I had purchased). They still look ok from a distance but a close inspection reveals flaws and they don't feel as sturdy as I recall. My impression is that the manufacturer has been cutting corners. I would only purchase them again if they were on sale.
260759,1,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
172094,1,"This is a great shoe, one of the best I've ever purchased. This shoe has it all, comfort, style, and fit. If you have a wide foot or a high instep, this shoe will still be comfortable on your foot. This is a great shoe for anyone who has to be on their feet for long periods of time. It looks especially nice with jeans or other causal pants."
253610,1,I love this shoe. I've been looking for a flat comfortable shoe and Enzo is the one. I really love that fact that I was able to get this particular shoe on sale less that half the regular price and in large size. I have ordered several more colors and I love them all.
35062,1,This is my second purchase of Danskos. I work in a restaraunt and on my feet all day. By the end of the day my feet do not hurt! My first pair of Danskos lasted me almost 8 years! Would highly recommend these to anyone who is on thier feet all day! WOrth every penny spent!
323079,1,"These shoes are great. Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever had. These shoes make me want to stop wearing Vans because of how durable and comfortable they are. Style of the shoe is awesome. If you're looking for a shoe with a ""fat"" tongue then these are the shoes for you. Would definitely buy another pair or a pair just like them. You don't have to be a skateboarder to get these. I don't really trick skate anymore, but I've always been a fan of the Accel. The all black Accel is so cool and fashionable, which means they go with any style of clothing, any color, and so on. Umm, just all around great buy. FIT TRUE TO SIZE. Recommend getting them in your most common shoe size if you like them snug and want the shape to stay the same after months of wearing them. If don't care about the shape, then get a half size bigger. Either way the size will still be very comfortable."
166696,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
82850,1,I don't typically like to wear flip flops as I find them uncomfortable (no support for arches & it hurts between my toes). These however are very comfortable. This is my 2nd pair (I lost the first one) and they last forever. I'll never buy another brand.
218979,1,"I bought these after having own Asics 2080s, which I loved. I wanted another pair of shoes with the IGS system. The product description says that these shoes do, but upon receiving them I do not believe that they do. No where on the shoe does it say IGS, unlike my 2080s which clearly have the IGS symbol on the heel.Other than that, they are fairly comfortable shoes. I have not had the opportunity to run in them yet, as I am still breaking them in."
187083,1,purchased as a gift for someone preparing for hip surgery and it works great for them! the end was a little flimsy but so far has held sturdy
374024,1,I just bought my 2nd pair of Merrell Jungle Mocs. I've worn the first pair for 5 years and they still look a-ok....bought another color for dress wear. There is no men's casual shoe that compares with the Jungle Moc for comfort and ease of on and off. I am 73 and my two pair will likely serve me the rest of my life.
259636,1,I was looking for this very type of shoes that I had previously been fitted for at a running store. I was able to find the pair pretty easily via name and number and make sure with the very accurate photographs. I then compared prices. I got a great bargain and ended up ordering two pair. Amazon rocks!This pair of shoe works exceptionally well for a first-time marathon trainee (I will run Chicago in October 2008). I am also a fuller figured woman who needs extra shoe stability and this shoe has fit the bill. I highly recommend this shoe but also believe that all new runners need to be professionally fitted before starting an running program. Get fitted at a running store like Fleet Feet but then get your replacement/second pair of shoes at Amazon. Runners need new shoes every 175-300 miles (that's a lot)!
244986,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
387882,1,"I purchased these shoes because they were recommended to me by my good friend. I have flat feet and can't wear anything but sneakers. These are the only shoes I can wear when I don't have sneakers on. They have become my slippers and pool shoes. I like them so much, I have purchased a second pair."
324077,1,These shoes are very comfortable and look just like Birkenstock. They feel like them also.
123125,1,Best shoes ever!Buy whenever I can find. I'm a mail carrier so shoes are very important. Only shoe I've found that can hold up
142839,1,Easy to buy and very trusfull for a costumer overseas. Have never got a product from an overseasfirm which have lived up to my exc. That goes for both the product and the handling from amazonThank you
199291,2,"So I ordered these shoes, thinking they would look just like the picture. I was wrong, they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver. I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw. The shoes were not only the color I didn't want, but also HUGE,WIDE & not what I expected. They came in a nice box though, but besides that I would not Buy these. I was so disappointed & I paid $71.00 for these? There's So many shoes out there...that you can BUY for less..& look just as good. I shouldn't' have paid this much for these shoes.."
74911,0,"I liked the boots, they fit comfortably. However after wearing them a few tims one of the lace hooks broke loose. Still wearable though, and I enjoy my boots alot."
181491,1,"Hands down best shoes ever made. Yup, that's right. Comfortable, versatile, look great with everything - jeans, chinos, shorts, or a swim suit."
348182,1,"These shoes are amazing. From the moment I put them on I knew they were special. I work on my feet all day, and these shoes have been the most comfortable pair I have ever owned. Since they are only a few weeks old I cannot speak on durability just yet, but the comfort factor alone warrants these shoes a five star rating. I don't believe that there is any reason to worry about quality because the stitching and leather both seem to be top notch. If you work on your feet all day, and need a classy set of shoes buy these."
66326,1,I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them. Good support in the arch and heel and no rubbing. The spikes are pretty sharp so they make good trail running shoes. You can take the spikes out with a key (provided) and they make good track shoes.
28310,0,good looking and well madebut ...so hard to walk withfeel like wood not leather
328531,0,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
278080,2,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year. After only 100 miles of hiking, the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off. Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material. I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well. Then, some years ago, our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper. Lacking any repair material, I had to hike 12 miles out, drive to town several hours away, purchase a new pair of boots, drive back, and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots, just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out! I'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed, Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues, that the experience was a fluke, and I went back to them. A mistake, apparently."
368662,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
316267,1,"My wife loves it, it's really comfortable, i'd like to get another pair for my mum or anyone else. Also not expensive."
275919,0,"I have been wearing Hi-Tec Altitude hiking boots for more than a decade, and I am now on my fourth (and probably last) pair. There are several reasons that I like them: 1) they are comfortable from the beginning, at least for me, and and don't require ""breaking-in"" (blisters are rare even after hiking ten miles a day); 2)they are reasonably priced (but I almost always buy on them on sale); and 3) they are relatively waterproof (however this doesn't last too long, but can be restored by treating them with Sno-Seal or a similar product as needed.I started buying and using these boots after owning an expensive pair of Vasque hiking boots and replacing the soles on those twice. For a little more than the cost of getting the soles replaced on those I could buy a pair of Altitudes when they were on sale. I've worn out three pairs of Altitudes (each lasts about three or four years for me with moderate to heavy use).The biggest drawback about these boots (for me) is that the glue used to attach the rubber sole and sides to the leather is ineffective. The rubber/synthetic materials start separating from the leather not long after I start wearing the boots. For years my solution has been to reattach and somewhat seal the edges with copious amounts of Shoe Goo. It makes the boots look ugly, but it does the job for a year or two, and then I need to reapply the Shoe Goo in smaller amounts. I've been hoping that Hi-Tec would start using a superior system to attach the sole and sides to the leather, but this has never happened. At this point I've given up hope and will be trying out other brands. It is really a shame, because I do like these boots otherwise, but I am tired of the lame glue issue. If it weren't for that perpetual problem I'd be giving these boots five stars, but as it is they only get three."
54009,1,"I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price. It is just as expected, great quality and reliable shoe!"
309603,0,"First off, the shoe I received is not the shoe pictured. I need plenty of support for my poor ole dogs and this shoe doesn't have it. It is truly a light walking shoe. I have since ordered the correct Easy Spirit and love them."
313236,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
140786,1,This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn for exercise walking on the treadmill or fitness walking outdoors. They allow my feet to breath and the cushioning makes my feet feel like they're walking on pillows. I wish I had bought two pair when I'd had the chance to get these on sale!
296150,1,this is a christmas gift. I already got one least year for me and my husband. It helps us when we clean our driveway from snow and ice. great product!
216140,0,Nice to have multiple closure options but some of the topical material came off with first washing.
67642,1,"I have just received and opened these timberland (medium) boots. They are my third pair of &#34;Tims,&#34; beautiful and a perfect fit. For women who love black boots with jeans or even with jean shorts (summer will be here soon enough!), these are a must. When I submitted my order I was a little worried about some reviews that stated the medium size was too narrow. Well, after putting these boots on and showing them off to my husband, I find them to be perfect. Also, for those with a slightly larger foot (like me!), I was pleased to find these boots give both a slimming and smaller effect. Either way, if you are a woman who likes the comfort and security of wearing a boot with your jeans during your off dress days, then this boot is for you. Lastly, shipping time and packaging was great. Leather around the ankle is a little stiff, but as all leather goes, I am sure it will relax after a couple of wears. Do not pass this up. Go Timberland."
274673,1,"This is a great product. I wore it for a week to break in. It gives great balance, comfort and handles the terrain very well."
245797,1,This is my third pair of this shoe. I love it. I can stand or walk all day in this shoe in comfort. They may not be the top line of fashion but for a casual shoe it is hard to find anything more comfortable.
377043,1,"My first pair of Wolverine boots. I have read nothing but good reviews, so I tried a pair. These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had. I use these 10 -12 hrs a day on concrete, gravel, slanted surfaces, etc. and these are sturdy and look nice. Almost like walking on air! Uppers made in Dominican Republic, assembled in the USA. I will never buy cheap Chinese (communist) made boots again."
333681,1,"I have been a Converse fan for years and have always bought my 4-year-old Converse as well. He asked for PF Flyers because of the Sandlot. Honestly, I might have to switch to PF Flyers. I watched Converse's slow slip into mediocre material that doesn't last as long. My son went through his Cons within half a year from wear and tear. These have been holding up very well and I see no obvious signs of wear on them. The soles aren't ripping from the canvas material which is a big pet peeve of mine with other shoes."
187373,1,"I am very pleased with my new Classic Tall UGG boots. I followed the recommendations of others and ordered an 8 (I usually need an 8 1/2 or 9). The fit is amazing. They are so warm I forget I am not wearing socks. I live in Maine and usually wear wool socks all winter, this is incredible! I did read the reviews and used almost an entire can of waterproofing spray to protect the suede. I gave them two coats a day for three days before I wore them. I will avoid wearing them in really sloppy weather (I have boggs to wear in the slush and med) but for the regular cold and snow - I don't know how I managed without them."
7062,1,Had to cut with scissors the front tongue where the sewing begins so that I could wear the slippers. The slippers are fine now.
356638,1,"I love Reef shoes and I love these...they are comfortable and have nice arch. I have a high arch and are able to wear these all day. I have the brown/pink combination. Nice looking, sporty shoe for a ""flip flop""."
252106,2,the mid stinks compared too the old high-top iseemed to me it was sized abit smaller. if you liked the 4600 high top you'll be disappointed in its &#34;replacement&#34;2 thumbs down
333655,1,"This is a great shoe,I have been wearing this style for years. Unfortunately I think Sebago is discontinuing this shoe."
109284,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
107900,1,"I really like this shoe. I wear a narrow shoe and it is sometimes difficult to find narrow ones. However, this shoe runs quite narrow. I'm quite confident that it will ""streatch"" out with some wear as the shoe is genuine leather. All in all, I am pleased with the shoes."
255731,1,My grown daughter always preferred K-Swiss so I knew this would be a good fit for my grandson.They are true to size and fit great. He loves them.
55388,1,"I love this shoe. It is the same style that I had twenty years ago. The shoe is light weight, comfortable, and durable. I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely,csh"
88689,1,"I bought a pair of these for my teenage son when we moved into a house with tile floors (it is chilly on the feet in the mornings!)--despite the fact that my son is occasionally picky about his footwear, and that he has very wide feet, these worked nicely!He wears them every day, and I don't have to keep reminding him; when I asked if he liked them, he said they were more comfortable than socks. Given that he is very blunt about disliking things, I'd say that ranks as high praise!"
291642,1,"Boots are as described, fast shipment. No concerns with the product. These were a Christmas gift, my nephew loved them."
142904,1,Teva has the best shoes for those of us who have bunions and/or high arches. The shoes form to your foot shape and provide adequate padding. If only they could come up with a flip flop type shoe that also is somewhat enclosed so that they can be worn at work.
371234,1,"The boots are very comfortable and fit well (I ordered a half-size smaller than I wear in regular shoes because I was afraid they would be too big and I'm glad I did). They are very cool and a bit trendy with the very square, somewhat elongated toes but I like them because they're not too dressy or too casual... can wear them with just about anything. I will definitely buy more Steve Madden shoes!"
14667,1,When I got these shoes I thought they were great. I put them on and they had great room for the toes and also felt great on the feet. I got the green one and the green color looked alot better in person than on the website. I loved the color!The only thing I see wrong with these shoes is the paint or what ever it is starts to come off very quickly where your laces are in the middle. Another thing is on the back the thing that says 3N2 peels right off and doesn't stay on. I do like the product but there needs to be something done about these problems!
186931,0,"I love Propet shoes but these were not my style. They are clunky compared to what I have ordered before, maybe I can break them in this summer."
211856,1,"The heels of this shoe were rubbing my heel very uncomfortably but perfect other than that not anything seller could have done diffrently, would order from seller again. Thanks"
1543,1,"I am not an outdoor person nor a hiker. I work in IT and often walk a lot. I had the normal work shoes, even a pair of Dr. Schols. My feet around the balls of my feet HURT. It was to the point i was going to see a doctor as I felt like an old man. I decided to try these boots since all my walking was like hiking. This was more then I ever spent on a pair of shoes, but that pain was just too much. I began wearing these shoes and within a week I could feel the pain in feet going away. Now I am pain free and I wear the boots EVERYWHERE. Money well spent."
116857,1,"I just purchased my third pair of Bonnie Lites and own wine, black and taupe. I have knee problems and a hard insole really hurts my knees. The Bonnie Lites are well padded and like walking on pillows. Stylish and comfortable!"
6330,1,This is the second pair of Carolina boots I have purchased in succession. I do not remember the model of last years pair but I paid about $30 more. I work in a metal fabrication shop and am pretty hard on boots. I expect and depend a pair of boots to last a full year as our company does provide a limited boot allowance. The sole on these boots wore as well as any pair I have owned. I have owned Caterpillar and Wolverine in the past. This pair (8510) took a few days to break in so I had to alternate with an old pair but once broken in I was very satisfied with the comfort. Eventually I put in some neoprene inserts to help with cushioning. I walk briskly and put on many miles in our large shop and I was happy with how the support held up. The only problem I had was the leather around the steel toe came apart earlier than last years pair and toward the end of the year I was concerned the toe would actually fall out. Keep in mine that working with steel and sheet metal is brutal on foot wear. I decided to move up a bit this year and just purchased the 1809 model and though early they broke in much easier. I intend to buy some Toe Guard or Gorilla Toe Guard to protect the toe. If it wasn't for the toe leather falling apart I would have given it five stars
131187,1,"I have been wearing this type of shoe for 20 years, because I have a left foot war injury and these shoes make it possible for me to walk without foot pain."
71926,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
108662,1,"I bougth it for my 23 years old son, he told me they are great and they are so comftable."
252647,1,"Brought these shoes couple months ago & have been happy with them. I generally am US sz11 or AU sz10 but found these are running a little bigger so when I purchase my next pair of these will be getting US sz10.5 instead of 11. I find them very comfortable for working long shifts & they are wearing well so far, but am thinking of adding a little more arch support but they are ok without added extra's.Update: I've had these shoes for near 12 months & they are great. I want to order more but amazon dont have them only other shoe sellers do that dont do shipping to Australia.Plz Amazon get these shoes back to being able to be shipped to Australia as I need another 2 pairs.These shoes fit my insoles for Plantis nicely & am finding that these shoes are the only ones I can wear atm because of hip ligament injury"
344521,1,"These boots replaced a pair that had finally worn out after over 10 years of frequent wear. I was expecting and dreading an uncomfortable break-in period. To my surprise and immense joy, these boots -- size 9.5D -- slipped on easily and fit comfortably from the very first wearing. NB: I wear them with insoles and they fit snugly but are not tight.The soles of the boots provide sufficient and safe grip/traction on slippery surfaces but still slide well enough for dancing. They also take and hold a shine extremely well.I've had several occasions to wear them in rainy weather and my feet stay completely dry even after wading through shallow puddles.I wasn't happy with the tags on the exterior. They are easily removed.All in all, these boots are a great value. I wear them almost every day and highly recommend them to anyone wanting a comfortable, dressier style of cowboy boot."
255293,1,I've been buying K-Swiss laceups for my daughter since she was first walking. They're very stable and are not so easy for her to remove as shoes with velcro. The teachers at her daycare really appreciate that! I had a good local discount source for these shoes but couldn't find a 5 -I was thrilled to find them on Amazon at such a reasonable price.
311975,1,The moccasins were as advertised. They are very soft and just the thing for wearing in the house.
29292,1,"I love these shoes, unfortunately, I've worn out two pair and I can't find my size 8 any where........you have'm, I'll buy em!"
223230,1,"My wife loves these. She has perpetually cold feet once the weather turns chilly, and the kids picked these out for her. Great gift."
216496,1,"I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe."
141796,1,The shoes are versatile and very comfortable. Sizing is accurate and the price is right. I am pleased with my purchase. Good buy.
47684,1,"This shoe fits great and is very comfortable except for the interior. It has tiny little bumps that, when you first wear the shoe, are uncomfortable. I had to wear socks the first few times before my feet became used to the bumps (or perhaps the bumps weren't as sharp because the shoes has been worn.)"
205857,1,These are so comfy and are really walking shoes. I liked them so much I ordered a second pair. Shoes are difficult for me to buy as my feet are small and narrow but these fit.
263687,1,This is the third pair of these boots that we have purchased. They are very sturdy and last about one year. The soles wear out much faster than the rest of the boot. My husband is a carpenter and wears them everyday to work. I am going to take the other two pairs and see if I can get them re-soled. Love the fact that they are made in the USA!
156301,1,"These are nice but I do think they run small compared to OTHER ballet slippers. Their quality isn't as nice compared to, say, Bloch brand slippers but for a little kid to practice or play in they work just fine."
258896,1,My 23 y/o son asked for these for Christmas and he was ESCATIC! He loves them so I guess this would be a positive review! Shipping was fast and came in great condition.
26577,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
354066,1,My son loves the boots. Seem to keep his feet dry even on rainy and snowy days. These are durable all-purpose boots.
117162,1,"I'm a woman with a long,wide, foot with a high instep. It is hard to find a good womens boot that fits well. Thats why I choose a man's boot. They fit like gloves, give me the support that I need, and look good,as well."
10485,1,"I danced for years as a kid, and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types. They don't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes, but they hold up a little longer (and because my toes are on a slant/angle, the shape looks better anyway). I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small, but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes. I had to exchange them, and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days."
304914,1,This slippers do the job. They are very cozy. The only thing I would suggest is to go up a size. Other than that there are not any problems with them.
91670,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
37224,0,"I currently own two pairs of the Danner Mountain Light II Boots because I liked my original pair so much, that I bought a second pair. In fact, had I written this review many years ago, when I first started using the original pair, I would have given them five stars. But alas, I cannot now do so.Yes, they are very comfortable boots, assuming you throw out the insoles they come with and use Superfeet Green insoles instead. Yes, the leather is buttery soft and very tough and durable. Yes, they can be resoled, which generally cuts down on your boot budget if you hike and climb a lot. Also, the Gore Tex liner keeps your feet dry except in extreme conditions. And, I give Danner a big thumbs-up for their recrafting department, which is super helpful and efficient.The problem is with the Vibram Kletterlift soles that are used. I have used boots of innumerable types with Vibram soles for as long as I can remember. My original Mountain Light pair had Kletterlifts which lasted a very long time before needing replacement. Unfortunately, Vibram soles are no longer made using the same formulary as they were a few years ago, so they wear terribly, especially in the lugs. I wear mine down to the mid sole in about a month or so of very hard use. As I live in Argentina, where no cobbler is capable of resoling these boots, I must return them to Danner in Oregon, an expensive proposition.This Vibram wear problem is not just with my Danner boots but also for example with my two pair of La Sportiva mountaineering boots, which have different Vibram soles, but the identical wear problem. With my La Sportiva boots, the soles are shot after just two weeks of hard use. I have spoken to people in the industry and they have assured me that it is not my imagination, that Vibram has changed their formulary.I can understand the dilemma for boot companies. Almost everyone insists on Vibram soles because of their past reputation. If a boot does not use Vibram its sales may suffer. The customer's desire for Vibram forces companies to use them. They are darned if they do and darned if they don't. But, I would like to think that the boot companies have enough influence with Vibram to get them to change the formulary back to what it once was.Danner, I beg of you, please rattle Vibram's cage and get them to change back!"
206783,1,"I like the design, but the bottom was kind of weird. They feel kind of strange walking around in them, but I'm not sure if that's just because I have yet to break them in, or because the design inherent in the shoe is messed up. You have to do up the laces all the way up the shoe's tongue yourself."
30609,1,"These shoes are cute and cozy, my feet love them, people go crazy about my Naughty Monkeys'."
373042,0,"I'm a nurse in a busy facility. I rarely have the luxury of sitting down during my shift. I am always walking and standing. I really don't have foot problems but saw this ad and thought I'd buy a pair to see how they feel. First - the sizing is a bit odd. I wear a standard size 8 - medium width, and I guess I was too quick to order the 8M- which turns out to be US size 8D. These shoes are a bit snug around the toe area, and my feet are not wide at all. The heel also comes up a bit high on my ankle, which is a bit uncomfortable.They are sturdy shoes and I expect them to last a long, long time. Compared to the nurse shoes I usually wear, these shoes are pretty hard. I'm not 100% sure I'd order them again."
306201,1,They fit and felt great right out of the box. I would recommend these shoes to anyone.
44044,1,"lighter and more breathable than anything i've worn before (great for hot summer days) - so comfortable, it's hard not to wear them around casually - i hope they hold up for awhile, but i'm ready to buy a new pair when these wear out - definitely buy .5-1 size bigger as recommended"
367278,1,"This product works as advertised. My only complaint is that it doesn't really feel sturdy enough to hold 4 heavy boots at one time. The arms flex rather easily, and I would be afraid that they would crack and break off if you tried to dry 4 ski boots at once. I'll do two boots and two gloves, or 4 gloves, but not 4 boots. If you really think that you'll need to dry 4 boots at once, I would recommend that you get two of the boot dryers that you insert down into the boots."
247799,1,"I wore these all through the 80s - but when the 80s ended, I could never find them again. Now, thanks to the internet, I can buy a new pair anytime I want to. Now, if they only came in tigerstripe or leopard print.."
257010,1,Very comfortable. Good sandal for walking. Delivery was prompt. I bought the natural color although I was really interested in the multi color one. The computer images made it look too dark and/or colored and I was more interested in a subtle tone.
376794,1,"I love the new reebok shoes but they should make them for women also. Because they are wonderful they feel good when you were them. The reason I gave the shoes 4 stars is because they don't make them for women becuse most women play sports like: basketball, and other sports. I think that they are wonderful as a matter of fact you should buy some and I mean right now! Go, run and get these before there is none let. Serious cause knowing me and all of my friends and family are going to be wearing them. I love reebok shoes!!!! Buy them NOW I mean it!!!"
10517,1,"I really like these ballet shoes. They are a little snug, I ordered my actual shoe size (8.5) and probably could have used a 9, but they will stretch out with wear. They are comfortable and were a great value!!"
140177,1,"For over 25 years I have relied on Softspots for casual wear. The shoes are durable and very comfortable. Great for travel and slip off going through airport security. The range of color choices (black, navy, brown, taupe) add a plus."
62246,1,"I previously had the same Keds sneaker. Liked them. Ordered a medium width, not a wide width. Had to return them."
48369,1,"The last time I went to Brazil, I was really young and was able to bring back a couple of Havaianas. Ten years later, some of those shoes worn out because of so much wear! This shoes are super comfy like walking of marshmallows. So I had to restock so I this one on Amazon. I love them and I just can't stop wearing them!"
32521,1,"I'll be staying in the hospital for a few days in a couple months and I was looking for some type of slipper that I could throw away before I came home (I'm a germ freak when it comes to hospitals). This is perfect. It's cheap enough to be able to throw it out before I come home, it's more substantial than the hospital socks, but it's not as clumsy as slippers (for being in bed). I'll probably get another set for around the house.The only thing that is bugging me is that the elastic strap around the top is a little too tight for me and is digging into my skin. It may need to just loosen up a bit."
323011,1,"Before I extoll the virtues of how cute the boot is, all buyers should be aware that this style is known to run 1 size smaller than your normal size and they do not have half sizes so you MUST order one size up.Beyond that, they are great quality, cute, comfortable and practical for colder areas and very trendy for this fall ...wear with pencil thin jeans or with boot socks and minis. I highly recommend them over the typical UGG look for this trend...just a little something extra to them in style.(It is also advisable to put a suede protectant on them to prevent damage from water and such.)"
189355,1,Great product....and this coming from a reformed CROC hater. You'll never wear a more comfy pair!!!
342641,1,Great purchase! Great service! Great delivery! my boyfriend was very happy with his present. Thank you for making it so easy
288,1,"This is my second pair of these boots, and I bought a pair for my son, also. Though I would like the soles to last longer, I realize that I am hard on my boots. There is that balance between softness/traction and hardness/longevity to consider. The uppers stay in great shape. I am very satisfied with the boots, and Amazon is a very reliable company to work with. They ship accurately and quickly."
301027,1,"My eight year old received these for Christmas and wears them constantly. They are durable, comfortable and look great! I did order them in his actual size and found them to be roomy, but with a heavy sock it's fine. He absolutely adores them!"
37262,1,"I write this after having just received and unboxed the boots earlier today. After only a few hours they appear to be amazingly well built.I have been an avid hiker and backpacker across the years, but have scaled back the last few as I entered into fatherhood.Merrells tended to be my brand of choice, with the all leather ones faring the best.As time went on, I changed my boots for my budget, from Vasque to North Face, and most recently to the Asolo FSN95s.The last pair I bought based on both price and glowing reviews.I had thought I sized them correctly, but they have always felt rather narrow and tight overall.I wear size 11 for nearly all my footwear and did the same for those, but should have gotten the 11.5s in hindsight.They were adequate for day hikes, but I nearly tore off my heels on a recent backpacking trip into the Adirondack high peaks.Enough was enough, and I began my look elsewhere with more of an eye on comfort, fit, and quality than on overall cost.Again my eyes tended towards my faithful Merrell Wilderness boots, but then I found the Danners.These are all leather, and gore tex lined for breathability and waterproofing, well fitting out of the box, and better yet - USA made.The price on these retails as the Merrell Wilderness, but with sale pricing they were nearly half off, and a far better all american bargain (which Merrells are no longer.)I had purchased these in 11EE, so it should have been wider than normal.So I was rather surprised to find the fit as good as it was on the sides, which tells me these tend to run narrow - so size your pair accordingly.The cost is more than your average sneaker style boot, but considering how well leather will mold to the feet, I expect these to fit and endure far better after a short breaking in period.The boots can also be resoled (only by Danner for a fee), and there are many reviews from long time users all over with 10-20 years of wear with nothing but pride in their written words.I look forward to fully breaking these in, and expanding on my review, but the hours I've walked around the yard and in my home, are enough to tell me I've certainly made the right choice for a quality product that can easily outlast 4 pairs of other branded boots, and cost far less in the end.I will be applyingObenauf's LP Boot Preservative (8 oz)in the next few days, which will enhance the leather, speed up the breaking in, and help them last.Bring on the years and miles!"
98404,1,"This is the first pair of cowboy boots I have owned in a long time. I bought the boots because I was needing more arch support. These boots are great. Arches are supported, boots are very comfortable. I wore them the first day for 8 hours without any problems. I am thinking about buying a second pair in a different color."
381846,0,"I really like the look of these shoes. Everyone who sees them thinks they are cute. The feel like flimsy flip-flops on, though. If you are not OK with essentially walking around barefoot (no support) don't get them. Also, if you break off one of the sequines, the rest start coming off since they are just threaded on one string. I covered the toes with clear nailpolish in the hopes that they would not unravel more and to stop the other one from starting. It seems to have worked so far."
154374,1,I have been buying Ecco shoes for years and find them to be very comfortable right away and they last a long time. I like them better than Rockport. I currently own three pairs.
315043,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
240258,1,"just love these boots. needed a plain black pair.. didnt want a heavy boot or a ridiculous price. so of course i went to Amazon and looked for timberland boots. my favorite place to shop and my favorite boot manufacturer. got a great price- fast delivery and a pair of boots in perfect condition. very happy with this purchase. i am a womens size 7= a 5.5 big kid in almost all timberlands. this is the only place that gives me the 3 things i need when buying tims, size,variety of design and prices i love! best part is i can shop in my pajamas :)"
108472,1,"This is a nice sturdy shoe, but no matter that it is advertised as a ""slip-on"", a shoe horn is very much needed to put it on."
133411,0,"I had read the reviews to order bigger, because they run small, so I did. I ordered a full size larger, and they were still too small. I also ordered narrow, and they weren't very narrow. I had to send them back, and did not order a different size, because I didn't get the full refund. Very cute, but not worth it."
107010,1,My three pairs of SAS shoes arrived this afternoon 2/9/11. I am happy with the speedy service and quality of product. I will order from Papa Shoes the next time I need SAS shoes.
106689,1,"Unfortunately Steve Madden has the dumbest policy on returns and exchanges for sale items. YOU CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE THEM! I think I would have better things to say about this shoe if it fit me more appropriately..From past experiences with previous Steve Madden products, I found that I had to buy my shoes a 1/2 step up in order to get a more comfortable fit. I ordered these shoes online, so I went ahead and ordered a 7.5 thinking that would be the perfect fit. To my dismay, they were slightly loose and flapped when I walked around. Thank God there are &quot;heel snugs&quot; that you can buy at the grocery store in the shoe section (where the shoe polishes are, shoe laces, etc.) and once I applied the heel snugs into my shoe, it made a WORLD of difference. Now they fit perfect and at last I can give a review those shoes deserve.They are definitely dressy enough to wear with dress pants, yet casual enough to wear with jeans. The toe is pointy enough to give the illusion of slimmer legs. For those of you looking for comfort, I can guarantee that you will get a lot of mileage with these cute shoes!"
83543,1,I bought the reefs for my daughter and she loves them and says they are very comfortable.
357015,1,"The boots were very nice, warm and extremely comfortable but not much on looks. Also, I followed the advice of reviewers before me and ordered a size bigger and they are too big. So I would say they must be true to size."
107327,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
253582,0,"good looking shoe, well constructed, but size runs small, at least 1/2 size."
350944,1,hola todo fino Excelenteeeeee muy hola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommendy poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendobuenoooooooooooooooooooo recomendado
113870,1,"It's been awhile since I have worn Adissage sandals, but they are just like I remember..maybe more comfy. I like that there was a wide width choice..and the pink is pretty!!"
378716,1,"Absolutly the best money I have invested on shoes. I live in a VERY cold part of the country and these are perfect for my 14 month old. Totally non-slip, and the fur goes all the way through the boot, so well made. Perfect and worth every penny!"
9439,1,"This show is not only cute and wonderful color, but so very comfortable. Almost like wearing slippers. True to size and width."
1655,0,"I have only had these shoes for a short time and maybem they need to br broke in a little, but the arch area is a little uncomfortable."
138110,1,"I was so happy to receive it on the day it camebecause my other sneakers was worn out becauseit was torn, and I finally put my other sneakers inthe trash because I finally got this new sneakersto wear."
180012,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
259379,1,muy bien lo que se esperaba y en el tiempo estimado 100 % recomendado muy buena la compra del articulo
282455,1,These came earlier than what was promised. They are durable and exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price
381208,1,"If you have worn soccer shoes before, it will not come as a surprise to you that they fit VERY snugly at first. I like to wear-in my soccer shoes slowly, so I wore them during school, and took them off right afterward. It took about a week for them to stretch out, but now they fit my feet perfectly."
75959,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
180835,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
358723,0,I had to order a pair of these for my daughter for a play she is in. Normally she is between a 5 1/2 and a 6. We purchased a 6 1/2 thinking we would be ok... nope! Way too tight! We are returning the 6 1/2. After calling around we found a place about 35 minutes away that has one pair which turns out is a 7. My advice if you order these.... order 2 LARGER pairs at the same time and return the ones that don't fit since size seems to be a common issue with these shoes.
91534,1,These shoes are great - comfortable and durable - exacly what I was looking for! I have worn them for multiple performances and they still look great!
42291,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
198080,1,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
19039,2,"Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several, however this particular model# 3902 runs large. Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size. My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes, only the sizing. Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct, they do!"
306542,1,These shoes are very comfortable and durable. They fit very well. Would reccomend them to anyone looking for a comfortable pair of shoes
349229,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
154793,1,"These are good shoes that will save your feet lots of trouble. They will accommodate inserts such as orthotics if you need to use them. They do not, as the copywriter suggests, ""feel like going barefoot"" -- they are a bit warm in summer as closed leather shoes tend to be. They are well made and give your foot plenty of support where it is needed. You'll notice they mostly come in colors suitable for nurses, but I am not a nurse, so I wear the black ones and sometimes children see my feet in bathroom stalls and think a man is there! What I'm trying to say is, while these shoes look quite respectable, they are not very feminine. However, if you get foot problems from less structured shoes as I did, these are great."
229967,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
99343,1,Product was exactly as expected. Extremely satisfied with the purchase. Word twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen and twenty-one.
351553,0,"The shoe needs to be ordered a full size up. I did, and the shoe fit perfectly. However, I was dissapointed with the quality. The fur was very weak. In fact, it was already bold on the back of the left shoe, and I have not even worn them! Also, the fur was poorly sawn in and splitting on the same shoe. Comfort was there. However, I could not envision being able to wear the shoe more then a few times before the fur would complately disapear, leaving a bold and tired looking spot. Not worth it!"
268642,1,"I love these tap shoes, which are replacing my original patent leather shoes I bought prior to my first tap lesson. These are soooo comfortable and the sound is great. I wished I'd purchased them a long time ago. Some reviewers have complained about the screws falling out. I haven't had that problem but I have only had these shoes for a month.I originally purchased a half size larger than my shoe size, but they were too snug. I hesitated about ordering a full size larger (thinking they would have to be too roomy), but they are a perfect fit."
361172,1,"I have always like Grasshopper shoes and was pleased to see Amazon had a pair that would suit my needs. They arrived promptly, but sad to say, they were the wrong size. I had omitted to notice they were a W width and I have a narrow foot. The cost and trouble of returning them is not worth it, and nobody here that I know of wears a size 11W, so I'm stuck with them."
225039,1,Sent these to my daughter in law in Calif I live in Indiana very convient. She let me know what size and color also sent her a picture and a birthday message Very nice. very happy very very satisified
180755,1,Arrived in 2 days.Still the same wonderful shoes I remember from high school 25 years ago.
64191,1,"I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality. They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store. I'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe, or just aren't familiar with ked's. Also, the sizes are the same as normal ked's. I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small. I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear, and they're too loose. I'll keep them anyway because they're so inexpensive, but I wish I hadn't listened. Probably unrelated, but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48. Excellent shipping."
161170,1,"I was debating whether I wanted to buy a pair online or just go into a store and buy them there. Boy am I glad I went to go buy them in person... as other people have mentioned, Converse run a little big so a size 11 (which I am) is really a 9 or so. I ended up getting an 8/5 and I haven't worn 8/5 size shoes since I was 13. You really want to go and buy them in person and completely avoid this problem."
339880,1,I asked for a black converse all star. Shoes arrive on time as schedules and in perfect condition! They came in their original box.
69747,1,"I use this shoe for training and for racing, for long runs and for interval workouts. My weekly mileage is in the 30-38 mile range, and the Green Silence is a nice, light ride. I believe the weight is advertised as 8.3 ounces, and without getting out my wife's food scale, I'd say that's a pretty accurate estimate. My sense is that there's a limit to the number of miles I'd take this shoe. The cushioning is limited, but the overall feel is pleasantly surprising. Short distances feel really smooth; longer distances slightly less so, compared to traditional trainers. The payoff, though, is the lightweight feel and speed--the exact qualities I want in a shoe when I'm looking to do faster training."
199267,1,They are not only made well but comfortable and durable. Timberland makes a good product and they last (my last pair must have been 10yrs +). Throw in a good price and you can't loose.
148064,2,I normally wear an extra wide shoe. I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it.
86359,2,"So I ordered these shoes, thinking they would look just like the picture. I was wrong, they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver. I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw. The shoes were not only the color I didn't want, but also HUGE,WIDE & not what I expected. They came in a nice box though, but besides that I would not Buy these. I was so disappointed & I paid $71.00 for these? There's So many shoes out there...that you can BUY for less..& look just as good. I shouldn't' have paid this much for these shoes.."
322533,1,"This shoe is a high quality product of the Capezio Ballet Shoe, manufactured in Vietnam from Leather (upper) and Suede (sewn sole as shown). Contrary to other reviews, the ONLY man-made fabric/material is the inner lining, thread, strap and bow. These are genuine leather shoes.BEWARE: Sizing is WAY off. See photos for comparison to size 3 street shoe for reality.They come packaged in tissue paper and a small compact end flap box (not a ""shoe box""), suitable for wrapping.Pros --Excellent quality for the identical shoe costing $30+ at local outlets-Leather+Suede with Fabric man-made breathable lining.Cons -Sizing is the only issue here. Consider fitting your Ballerina at a local store, and then ordering these shoes here, or at worst, adding 2 sizes to the ""street shoe"" size shown.All in all the shoes are a great buy at the sub $25 price range, and smell like Ferrari's (Leather) out of the box."
215008,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
211735,1,My first pair of these were stolen by a relative so goes to show how nice they are that I felt compelled to replace them. These shoes go with everything. You can dress them up slightly and they won't look out of place. (Great for those of us who aren't too fond of heels but who don't want to rock regular tennis shoes all day long.) They're comfortable. A good weight. Durable. Easy to clean. I love them.
242574,1,My granddaughter asked for these at Christmas. She thinks they are awesome and can't wait to wear them to school in the new year.
279895,1,"Bought as a gift for my son. They were true to fit size, comfortable and a very good price."
11625,1,I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect. They arrived on time and the fit was exact. Will certainly order from the manufacturer again.
343103,1,I just received my first pair and they were not true to size (9 1/2) so I have to return them and get larger size. Beware.
270141,1,I have worn these for many years and will keep buying them as long as I can buy them. I usually get a year out of them. Very light but supportive. If you're looking for something comfortable and durable these are very good shoes and conservative enough that you can wear them working in an office.
275370,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
376766,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
376686,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
71262,0,"i have had several pairs of these boots over the last 4 years, all desert (5'7"", 135). they are extremely comfortable, like a tennis shoe, very flexible, breathable, lightweight. however, if you are going to be doing much of anything beyond a couple hours in the field with a light to moderate pack, i couldn't recommend these. there just isn't much support, anywhere. the ankle and the 'shank' are the most obvious areas where the lack of support is apparent. also, several of my mates have had the stitching fail around the forefoot of these boots. but for light work, i haven't worn a boot yet that is more comfortable."
316154,1,"I have bought this shoe two times. The first time I went to a Stride Rite at the mall and paid much more for them. The second time I bought them online for a better deal. I continue to be satisfied with this shoe. My daughter has loved them as well. They go great with anything. She is outgrowing her second pair, but I will wait until they have her size."
372881,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
114008,1,These shoes are great for work. They are comfortable (not too wide either so I'm not swimming in them) and look really nice to boot. Overall happy with my purchase.
111784,1,I bought a size up mostly for ease to slip them on and off and this was the right choice for me. They are very warm and comfortable.
277383,1,"For the money, I don't think you can buy a better hiking boot. In fact I think these boots are a great buy even at full list price. At least for my feet, Hi-Tec boots have always been long on comfort and durability. I've had these boots for several years and worn them for hiking, birding and general outdoor stuff. They're great for keeping your feet dry crossing streams or walking through wet grass. They require little if any break in. There's really nothing wrong with the laces that come with the boots, but for just a few bucks I prefer some good round boot laces on them. For me these are easier to tighten and have a more substantial feel."
325073,1,"A great boot. I've been using the Copa Mudial for 15+ years. They last a long time, feel great and are just a classic."
25721,0,These were represented as Gray and Navy. They are SILVER and Navy Blue. Luckily they are running shoes for my son and color is not as important as fit. He is very happy with them. They are true to size and very comfortable.
1799,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
253469,0,"This is a fairly nice shoe, with moderate comfort. It is easy to slip on, but not as ""cushy"" as I had hoped. Overall, I am pleased with the shoe, but thought it was a little high priced considering the lack of comfort."
335670,1,"I recently purchased two pair crocs from Amazon, the Dahlia one featured on this review and a pair of yellow ones. I love both of them. I have also purchased other Crocs from Amazon in the last few months. The reviews I read at the time I purchased my first pair from Amazon was quite helpful as it mentioned that the sizing was off from the usual size you wear,that you need to go up one size,so that is what I did,and they all fit perfectly. I love the large variety of colors Amazon offers.I hardly ever wear any shoes other than crocs. I have two kinds of arthritis,so it is difficult to put on shoes other than those into which I can just slide my feet,plus they are so comfortable."
258168,1,These shoes are very narrow so it is important that you as the consumer buy a whole size bigger if you are interested. Other wise they are comfortable and stylish.
120559,1,"I love these shoes! I bought a pair almost ten years ago and wore them until the rubber fell apart on the sole. They are durable, go with lots of outfits and last forever in today's terms. I would buy them again and again."
106834,0,"This is a good looking shoe. But they are narrow. I was surprised because I have bought many pairs in the past and never had this problem. The bad thing is I bought 3 pair and all of them are them same, narrow. I wish now I had bought a 1/2 size bigger."
113107,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
16099,1,"The Shudoh Cellerator is a great shoe. It comes with two puma cell inserts, one for added comfort, one for added stability. These insoles slip right under the normal insole. They are great but the only problem is that the insoles make the boot tighter, so i would advise anyone who is buying these to buy a half size larger. They forgot to balance the sizing back out with the cells, but it is made up for in the rest of the shoe."
108442,1,"Review of product purchased from Amazon.com: I find the shoes good quality for the price. They are just what I ordered, and I have several colorsof the same shoe."
42516,1,"Slip them on and feel a quality tennis shoe. They glide, they stop on a dime, they cruise at 19,000 feet. Sweet, Suede, Puma."
18162,1,"We could not find these anywhere in the stores for under $60.00. I was very happy with the price and the delivery was right on time. They were a gift and it was exactly what she wanted.Thanks,Theresa"
21168,1,I always liked the Easy Spirit shoes.These are very comfortable and a good buy.I may order another pair in a different color.I would recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe.
259293,1,I love these shoes. They're fun and comfy to wear. I wore them all over Europe recently. They make me feel young and hip!
317737,1,"I love using cros for my daugher and she loves them too! We bought her the infant 2/3 for last spring and summer and now we moved up a size to the 4/5..... they are definitely a tad big but she's slowly growing into them. They are perfect for any season, in the fall and winter we just add socks and it works! now we add jibbitz to them (currently little mermaid and dora) and it makes it fun for her. The best part, for me, is that they are so easy to put on and take off so when we are in a hurry to get our the door she can slip them on quickly and we're on our way."
273071,1,"size is right. If you had shoes from fiveten before with similar design, order the same size is the best bet."
137324,1,"I am an avid deer hunter and spend many hours in the woods and these boots are super warm and very comfortable for walking. I regularly have to walk 1/2 mile + to get to where I want to hunt and these boots make the hike a breeze, I highly recommend to anyone."
134845,1,"For cross country runners who pronate, this is the shoe. NB makes a shoe with a little bit narrower heel that fits women's feet well. On my 3rd pair of this model and they've all held up well."
299098,1,"Great-fitting booties from Clarks make me feel great about pulling out all my old Beach Boys albums, and I'm almost tempted to start play with my old wood tennis racquet again!They feel like they were made for me, and the styling is jsut what I like. The price is great too. These long-lasting shoes go with any outfit, but are especially good for weekend escape time!"
287202,1,I was looking for an all around shoe to go hiking in the woods and to wear to a restaurant for a casual meal. The Rockport Prowalker has proved to be more than adequate to meet these criteria. I like 'em.
121040,1,"The converse XHI shoes look very comfortable and very rad man!!! I don't like ppl who wear black and pink together, because I wear black as a protest and in the 70's when they would protest they would wear black converse. SO PLEASE DON'T MIX PINK AND BLACK TOGETHER AGAIN, IT IS A TERRIBLE THING THAT YOUR DOING!! PLEASE!!!"
133546,1,This is a great boot and my son loved it. We live in Hawaii and went home for Thanksgiving to Idaho. Since my son had never worn boots like this we were concerned he wouldn't do well with them. But he really loved them and they survived two weeks in the rain and snow of Washington and Idaho. And they looked great on him! I definitely recommend them.
357163,0,"I ordered a half-size larger, in response to reviews here, and that was good advice. But alas, one shoe was larger than the other, even though marked the same size. Amazon, as always, was great about the return. Apart from that, it's a fun shoe at a good price."
66285,1,"Good job getting the shoes here ahead of schedule. They're a little different than expected -- guess the photos didn't show the detail as well as I thought. Once I got used to them, I'm pleased with the fit and comfort. For the price, thinking of buying another pair, maybe not just the same but similar."
150334,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
383382,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
280923,1,"These are some of my favorite shoes: classic, casual but attractive,comfortable, long-lasting. The shoes were delivered in less than a week from order. My only disappointment was that the navy blue color was not as deep as I was expecting, not as deep as the old Keds being replaced. It is still acceptable, though, and I look forward to wearing them for a long time."
282913,1,I really like these shoes. Great for the price. I have paid much more for less quality. I would reccommend these to anyone who wants a good pair of business casual shoes.
274501,0,"I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
366475,1,This was my 2nd pair of Keen shoes and they fit nicely and dry quickly when they get wet. They dont slip off when you submerge your feet in the water also.
352945,2,"This shoe is pretty disappointing. It is not as cute as it looks in the picture (the toe of the shoe is much more square), and it has absolutely no support and the toe box pinches your toes. I would not recommend this shoe."
129227,1,Great boots .Good sizing and width. I am very pleased with the brand so far.The materials used are very good and durable I think.
13581,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
154424,1,"The shoes arrived and where a little stiff when I first put them on. With in one day's wear they are already fitting my feet like a glove.The shoes are dressy enough to be worn with any outfit but a tux, but are casual enough to look perfect with jeans.The fit for the 47 is perfect for me. I normally wear 13 EE shoes. The back of the shoe has not rubbed my achilles raw like many shoes I have had in the past, and the shoe is wide enough for my feet to not bulge out the side wall of the shoe.I have had these about two weeks now and have not noticed any wear on the soles with daily use. I will monitor those and ammend my report should I experience any early deterioration."
74616,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
157755,1,"No, I am not out on a cross country ""Walk for Peace"" but when I wear these shoes every step I take promotes World Peace. I have a red pair of peace shoes and I bought my mom a pair of pink ones. We love wearing them out together - we are a Mother/Daughter team making a double statement! Also, we get many comments - whether together or alone. People just love them! I wish I had these Peace shoes in 3 or 4 other colors."
158341,1,It is nice to slip in to a new shoe and get the feel of a firm but comfortable fit. Lots of value here for the money.In my size they look like navy gunboats...and I love them!
267534,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
244143,1,"Several years ago I had problems running to include back pain and shin splints and was limited to running 2 or 3 miles at a time. I absolutely hated running, and I attribute this to ill-fitting shoes. After lots of searching for a new pair of shoes, I was recommended a pair of New Balance shoes...can't remember the exact model, but it was a predecessor to the 856. Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring. Good to see they're still available."
237071,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
67100,1,The all black look is great and slim so it works well with the back in style skinny jeans look for guys. Not the best arch support though so be wary of that. The shoes came quickly and although it seemed like they had been tried on (dust or animal hair on the bottom) it didn't seem as though they were worn outside or anything beyond being sampled as most shoes in any store would encounter if not purchased.
134488,1,"I ordered it on [...] in size 6. Yeah I'm a girl who likes big boots. I had been doing research on tall engineer boots for 2 weeks before actually bought it. After checking Frye and chippewa in local stores I decided to go for chippewa. the 1st consideration is price of course. God knows why women's boots are so much expensive than men's. Frye's 15"" Engineer boots for women are $[...] more expensive than Chippewa's. The 2nd reason is quality. For some reason, several Frye boots of the same style use very different leather. And each pair feels different from another when u step ur feet in. i can't help but doubt the actual quality of their boots. With Chippewa, at least all the boots I have seem are of the same quality, and they are all confortable to wear.Some ppl are complaining about the belts on 11"" Chippewa engineer boots. Unfortunately I have to say they are right. The leather used for these belts is not very good. But for me, a non-proffesional biker they are nothing but decoration. So yeah I am happy with these boots. Hopefully I don't need to buy other boots in 6 years if not longer."
200601,1,"I wear these all summer long - in gardens, stores, training, relaxing. I have five pair and will probably order more."
371930,2,"im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts, now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gonna throw it on the trash , i wasted $38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this ,i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed"
125602,1,i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here. overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light. im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air. i like them so far. not bad at all.
101724,1,"The shoes are great. Perfect for my toddler! She wears them will all her dressup outfits, as well as to her jazz class. Thank you!"
199440,1,Bought these for my son and he loves them. True to size. Would highly recommend. Great price for Sperry Topsider.
371959,1,I have purchased six pairs of these wonderfully comfortable shoes that can be worn with many different types of outfits.
220892,1,"I own this bag in red, honey and cloud blue and just purchased it it white. This bag is so perfect that I just can't say enough about it. It's not too big, but it still stores everything I need to carry. One of the things I like about it, is that the corners unsnap to convert to a totally different look. Trust me, you'll love this bag. Great looks and great quality without the high price of other designer bags."
135571,1,I bought a pair of these years ago and wore them until they fell apart. Could not find another pair until recently. I was perusing Amazon's website for shoes and found my old favorites. They are so comfortable and can be worn with anything. They fit true to size. LOVE THEM!!!
87487,1,"Been looking for a slip-on sneaker/walking shoe in local stores for a long time. I have bought those suede-like slip-ons...but not very comfortable after awhile. These shoes, on the other hand, are very comfortable. I am a 51 yr old heavy-set fella, and these shoes feel really good. I don't know about the wash-n-wear part...and doubt I'll attempt that....these are leather. Anyway, for the money. seems like a good buy."
316322,1,It was a Christmas gift and she loved them very much. Thanks for the great product. She said they fit great.
369858,1,"I have worn many clark shoes and there very comfortable, however this shoe becomes uncomfortable after wearing it for a long period of time because of the majority of your weight is on the front part of your foot."
173953,0,These aqua shoes have a great sole for constant running and wall tapping in aqua aerobics. I do not like the inner sole lining sliding all around.
192514,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
123679,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
15625,1,"Great prices, can't go worng with Chucks!! These are a classic pair, pair them with a spandex dress and blazer for a summer walk in the city! LOVE!"
18622,1,"I like the adidas +10.7's because they are very light and durable and they are also very comfortable on the feet. You get very good traction,I haven't slipped for the time that i have had them they are great in wet and dry conditions. I would deffinatly recomend these for soccer."
350701,0,Not bad for the price. I guess I need to break them in as they are hurting my feet at this point.
127183,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
350758,1,"I've owned my Merrell Moab Ventilators for about 2 years. They've been very good shoes. I find them very comfortable - good support, light, with good breathability. I originally bought them for walking around Disney World. They supported my feet well and my feet didn't over heat (make sure to also wear good socks, like the Cool-lite from Wigwam). The Moab's also handle the trails that I travel. Getting them wet has not been an issue, as they dry quickly and water doesn't affect the materials. The sole has worn very well and is still has a lot of tread on it. I haven't had to change the laces either. I wear them mostly around town with some light trail and hiking thrown in for fun. I also really like the looks of the shoe.After two years, it is time to replace them as the cushion and support are failing. The rest of the shoe structure is still in fine shape. I'll probably get a new insole and wear them as my grubby shoes."
79475,1,"I haven't worn converse for years! I forgot how wonderful they felt and how much fun it is to wear them. I'm a stay at home mom and want to get ""dressed to shoes"" every morning in some lace up shoes. I don't really like the look of white athletic type shoes unless I'm exercising. I love my new converse shoes!"
373481,0,"I got a pair of these boots because they looked really cute were comfortable and had a full sheep skin lining inside (even the toes). And I really liked them, while they lasted.... The ties on the back broke and the heel completely cracked, I think a support broke because the heel collapsed on me. I couldn't wear them more than the one season I bought them in and I expect a shoe to last at least two if not more (I have boots that are five years old and are just as good as they were when I first got them). So these were good boots but quality? not so much."
148208,1,"I am quite pleased with these shoes. They are comfortable out of the box. I have very wide feet, and I have a tough time finding shoes that fit. I wanted to buy something that was more reasonably priced than Wolkys (which I love). I bought a size 11, WW. It's a bit too long (a 10 would have been fine), but that's okay. I'm just delighted to have sandals that are wide enough! I would certainly buy another pair. I've never bought shoes online before, and it's worked out very satisfactorily."
5558,1,"I absolutely live in sheepskin slippers during the winter (working from home) and finally needed a new pair. Saw these and am thrilled with them. I am very surprised at the incredible quality and sturdiness of these slippers. Very plush sheepskin lining and thick, durable sole not only for walking outside if necessary but also for added longevity. The stitching detailing is also more flattering than my Bear Paw or Uggs IMHO. Sizing is true for me - I am standard 6 and these fit perfectly but if you are a half size, definitely order up. I ordered the Sand color (based on price) and thought they may be too light. But they are the same standard tan/taupe color as my other slippers so I'm guessing the All Spice and Root Beer colors are particularly dark. These slippers are every bit as comfortable and high-quality as the more expensive ones I have owned and highly recommend them for yourself or as a gift."
160864,1,"My fiance wanted some new converse shoes for his birthday, so I searched the internet for awhile trying to find the best deal, this was definitely it! It was the best price paired with free shipping, and they came within a week, so that was great! They've also held up very well, and he loves them, so they get quite a bit of use!"
340428,1,I get so many compliments on my chuck taylors' they bring back the good old days and so comfortable!! I wore these when I was a kid!!
304721,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
349729,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
12179,1,"I am a teacher and at Christmas time each year I ask for a student's name of whom the counselors or home health nurses know is not going to havea Christmas because of family finances and/or struggles. Well, this year I was given the name of a student I had in my own class and whom I had already had sucha great connection and loved this kid. To find out they were not going to have a Christmas broke my heart!! Anyway, through some other sources,I was able to find out what this student wanted more than anything, if they could ask for just even one gift for Christmas. The student said they would love to have some REAL Chuck Taylor blue high-tops !!The fake ones they had saved money to buy at a local ""discount"" store fell apart so fast and they felt they had wasted their money.So ... I ordered these for that student and had them given anonymously. Let me tell you ... when that student entered my classroom the very morning after the y received these surprise gifted shoes ....that kid was so excited to show me, so happy in general, so excited to see everyone and openly socialize with head held high. Wow ... what great things these shoes did for this student in far more ways thanjust keep their feet dry My heart was fulfilled and this student will forever remember these shoes, I am certain!!"
347150,1,My 23 y/o son asked for these for Christmas and he was ESCATIC! He loves them so I guess this would be a positive review! Shipping was fast and came in great condition.
9349,1,I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years. You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot.
350069,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
173312,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
270474,1,"I have been wearing this model of Rockports (7100) for over 15 years. A store near me told me that they were actually discontinued at one point by Rockport. There was so much demand for these that they were brought back. For me, I like the fit and feel of these shoes."
171071,1,Just a line to say how comfortable these shoes are. Anyone who has ever put ECCO shoes on their feet know this to be true. I am truly singing to the choir but to those that are considering a purchase of ECCO shoes...do it! You owe it to yourself and your feet!
150546,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
273032,1,I was very pleased with the product. I have used other shoes in the past costing as much as $50 more. These shoes are the best I have ever had. The are my favorite climbing shoes at any price.
257030,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
168378,1,These are the most comfortable pair of casuals I've ever owned.I recently was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. With extreme heal pain when walking these shoes have been a life-saver.They slip on and off and feel so comfy when I walk.They also do not make my feet sweat or become lose with the bungy lace.My first pair cost 59.00 at Macy's. Amazon had them much lower.
118168,1,"I bought these because I only want zero heel drop shoes to run in. These things have great traction for any type of surface. I've run on the track, the road, and even on the back country of the Carson/Iceberg wilderness in CA. They do what they are intended to do- provide a lightweight fast ride, with little support. These are not the right shoes for heel strike runners as there is about 1/3 the normal amount of cushioning at the heel. I think it's becoming common knowledge now that we all need to not heel strike anyway.The only drawback is that the shoes are not as durable as a heavier shoe, but that's what has to be sacraficed for the weight reduction. I've had them for about 6 weeks and have worn out some of the rubber lugs(does not affect performance or feel) and there is a tiny tear in the fabric on the side. But, like I said, I took them out for a couple of true cross country(miles of off trail) excursions where even hiking boots would have gotton some wear. I've put about 100 miles total on them so far, and will likely get at least 200 more- pretty good for a sub $40 shoe.Overall great shoes, and I plan to purchase some more!"
329419,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
224978,1,"In nostalgic moment, I decided I needed some Chucks. As a teen I wanted red ones but never got any, so now at 55, I said what the heck. They are as lightweight and comfortable as I remember. A great buy."
50368,1,"recived boots was very pleased with services and product.this is secondpair they are well made,and wear realy well"
152816,1,Love these boots. They are very comfortable. I wear them without sock and they keep my feet nice and warm.
173849,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
293831,1,"5-10 rubber is great - very sticky. This shoe is also good if you have a narrow heel. I can heel-hook in these and they don't slip. The toe box is on the pointy side. This shoe is not for you if you have a wide foot. Like most shoes when new, they might leave your feet red the first few times worn (from the dye), and can be tight at first. Mine felt fine after I broke them in (this took about 10 or so climbs, if memory serves)"
268858,1,"I have owned many Rockport shoes over the years, but these are the first from the Prowalker line I have purchased. I bought them from Amazon's sister company, Zappos. Normally, I wear size 14 but the Prowalkers in 14 were definitely too small, so I ended up with size 15 and those fit fine.I did quite a bit of walking (and driving) in the Prowalkers and they never gave me a problem - comfortable and no irritation from rubbing. The appearance is a bit dressier than most walking shoes, which is exactly what I wanted as I wore them to customer meetings and will wear them on a European vacation later this year.Clearly it is too soon to know about reliability, but I will be sure to update this review should my opinions change."
69859,0,"I just needed a basic blue flat pump, and it fit the bill. However, it was too big (at least by a half size) and rubbed my feet. I will be returning these or will give them to a friend."
247810,0,"These shoes took a time warp out of the 80's. Since i like and dislike some stuff about the 80's mainly the clothing i gave this 3 stars.If you want to look ahead of the game in style in Germany, which is stuck in the 80's, buy these shoes and be adored buy the germans. (i just went to germany and the majority of the country is stuck in the 80's and just beginning 90's styles)"
189631,0,"To good to be true...Are they original? Or some Chinesse copy? Any how good quality, at a right price..Go for it&iexcl;"
325286,1,"I have a heavy gait, and a wide foot. These shoes fit perfectly, and they last. I just retired one pair after 400 miles (compared to the typical 185 miles I got on the NB 991).I couldn't disagree more with the first reviewer. I think these shoes are great."
370777,1,I love these shoes. They're fun and comfy to wear. I wore them all over Europe recently. They make me feel young and hip!
59336,1,"My first pair of Hi-Tec Altitude IVs lasted around 10 years. I used them for work and for casual wear, and even hiked into Montana mountains on an overnight pack trip several years ago. They wore very well, and so I bought a new pair last year. The new pair has higher ankle support and seems a little heavier than the first pair, but are comfortable and appear to be durable. I did notice some sewing differences and that the tongues on the new pair do not catch pant cuffs, so that's a bonus. I recommend."
218648,1,this is my first time buying from amazon and it was a great experience. with 3-5 day shipping they came in 3 days. the shoes are great of course. this is my third pair of converse so i knew what to expect. they were in perfect condition when i received them. definitely don't hesitate to buy!
225203,1,If you are reading this review you probably already own a pair of Chucks. I love the look and feel of the Lo Top ones. They look great and feel great.
244699,1,"I just ordered these and have now worn them for 2 - count 'em: TWO - days. They are remarkably comfortable and appear to be very well made. And the fact that they're made by good folks in Wisconsin is just icing on the cake. I'll update this review as I have more ""miles"" on these babies, but for now I am VERY satisfied. Also - i will concur with some other reviewers that the size seems to run a bit large; I ended up with a 9.5 whereas I normally wear a 10. I suppose everyone's feet are different, so who knows if my experience on sizing will be the same as yours, but that's what I ended up with. Love these American made classics! Yeah, they look good too. The sole is cushy also. Feels good."
155866,1,"I just received TH Snapped Up Tote bag, my wife loves it! It's both elegant and very handy to carry docs, files. Smooth to touch with lot of space inside an ideal bag for woman working in the board office."
316512,0,"I like the look and how they remind me of my Dad...he wore Wallabee's while puttering around in the garden in the 70's. They're very comfy for standing in though I find them a bit...high? for walking in. Maybe I'll get used to it.My biggest gripe is the fit; first off I agree with everyone else...I usually wear a 12 but I had to size down to an 11.5. I don't like that unpredictability. But more than that, my pair the left shoe is larger than the right. The sole's are the same length, they're the same width but it still fits larger. So much so that I put a cheap, thin insole under the Clark's one and I'll be putting a heel cup in too. Unfortunately, in the rush of opening packages and dealing with a crowd building in the parcel pick-up place I didn't notice the discrepancy until I had walked in them outside so I'm stuck with them.Oh, and the right shoe (the smaller one) is giving me a blister on my small toe when the stitching is.IF I ever buy these again (doubtful) I will only buy them in a shop where I can try them on."
341544,1,I bought this shoe for my trip to San Diego and love them! They are extremely comfortable with great support and lightweight for easy packing. I am planning on purchasing another pair for summer wear as well. I highly recommend this shoe!
117764,1,"These look nicely made, but the sizing is roughly street shoe sizing, as other reviewers have noted. You could say this means ""they run true to size,"" but that's highly misleading, as ballet shoes normally run a size or so small. To repeat: they run true to *street* size, not normal ballet shoe size--at least in size 2.5. So, just be aware of that as you order or you'll be like me, shelving these shoes for a year before using them. (Luckily, girls grow, as the shoes are really not worth the time and postage to return.)"
21584,1,These shoes are one of a very few I have been able to wear all day without a break-in period.
197442,1,The all black look is great and slim so it works well with the back in style skinny jeans look for guys. Not the best arch support though so be wary of that. The shoes came quickly and although it seemed like they had been tried on (dust or animal hair on the bottom) it didn't seem as though they were worn outside or anything beyond being sampled as most shoes in any store would encounter if not purchased.
185359,1,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
173890,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
301055,1,she loves her boots..came in excellant conditions and on time..cheaper than buying them in a store..will purchase more in the near future
100299,0,"i've been looking for mary jane's for a while and decided that i'd give these a try since they were so reasonably priced. they also come in wide sizes, and that's a plus. i just received them and i have yet to wear them. i did try them on. while they are super cute, they are also really big. my feet get wider the closer you get to my toes, so my feet are sort of like...ducks feet?! lol. anyway, i imagine these would be comfortable enough for people that have the longer second toe. my second toe is much shorter than my big toe, that combined with the duck-like shape of my feet, causes these shoes to be a bit uncomfortable. the way the toe area is designed it leaves a huge gap between my smaller toes and the end of the shoe, and presses my big toe into my other toes.i realize that the shape of my feet are not the norm, but i know a few other people with similar problems and i thought i'd point these things out. to be make it clear...the toe area has it's longest point in front of where the second toe would be. anyone with a wide width across their toes might find these uncomfortable.they are also a lot bigger than i expected. i usually wear a regular 9 1/2 and these wide width 9's feel a lot more like a 10 or a 10 1/2 to me.they are cute though."
343721,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
325748,0,"These shoes were uncomfortable, not nearly as comfortable as the comparable shoe in birkenstock. The footbed is not quite the same."
122943,1,I was pleased with the quality of the shoelaces but most of all the quick delivery time!
61343,1,Bought this for Michigan winter. Keeps my feet warm and dry. Works fine on icy surfaces as well. Will test its durability now
310835,1,"Been playing tennis 30 years, this may be the best tennis sneaker I've ever had, durable, supportive, light, stylish... Highly recommend this sneaker"
40535,1,"These are my favorite Flip Flops.... so comfy, yet cute. And in Black they can pass for more than sporty.... I keep buying them year after year."
363292,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
213113,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
235875,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
355671,0,"I like these shoes a lot but are they really worth almost a $100 more than the sketchers I bought a year earlier. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra cushioning but would say cushioning insoles be just as effective and cheaper to boot? I guess it is one's individual preference. Me, I wish now I had just purchased another pair of Sketchers and bought some Dr. Scholl's insoles. Only time will tell if these outlast my last pair of boots and if so than that will be another plus."
324269,1,"The Betula sandals are true to size and are very, very comfortable.They look and feel just like Birkenstocks but are only half the price!"
48699,0,"These boots are super cute. I actually purchased them for a Halloween costume. Because I have small feet and wide calves, I thought the lace-up feature would help. It does help, however the tongue is too small so it looks weird. I think they're my best option, so I'll take them to a shoe-repair place to have a wider tongue and longer laces put on. From what I could tell, they felt fairly comfortable in the foot though."
11441,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
50972,1,"Got these shoes as a gift from my father-in-law a year ago (in brown). The first day I wore these shoes I walked over a mile continuously on asphalt and didn't have a minute of discomfort.I've also noticed that these shoes hold their shape and look a lot better than others as they age. My father-in-law has a pair of Park Avenue's that look just as new as mine, and they're about 15 years old. My brother got a pair of Bostonian's the same year I got these and they look like they're about 10 years older than mine.The tip from my father-in-law that has kept mine in good shape: Use the Premium Shoe Polish, not the wax shoe polish. Their premium polish is oil, not wax, based. This means that you're re-hydrating the leather and keeping it supple every time you polish it.If you use a wax polish the leather will gradually dry out unless you strip the wax and recondition the leather. Dry leather not only cracks, but easily absorbs liquid, so it's much easier to get a bad stain from salty slush on the side of the road."
52338,1,"My wife has feet that hurt a lot. She chose these sneakers based on all the positive reviews. After wearing them for only one day, she declared these were her all time favorite sneakers! Thank you, Amazon for offering the best prices!"
337341,0,"Just purchased my second set of these boots. I love them, but this pair has the same issue as the first pair. I wear a wide size. The left boot is more narrow than the right. I don't have this issue with any other set of boots so it's not that my left foot is wider than my right. It takes a month or two to stretch out depending on how much you wear them. It's very annoying until then. I've have a friend at work that wears these same boots as well, and he has the same issue. They will widen out but it's a big pain until they do."
189608,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
306611,0,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
321305,2,Sizing is off. I ordered my size 7.5 and they are way too big. I should have ordered the 6.5 which I never wear. The cost of shipping them back for the correct size was too much. I ended up keeping them even though they just sit on my shelf.
54693,1,Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe..
206287,1,My son wears his crocs everyday after we received them. I got him a pair with bigger size so he will be able to wear it next summer too!
144109,1,I was pleased with my purchase. I was looking all over for these black Uggs and could not find them anywhere. They came on time and was exactly what I wanted. I am not use to purchasing shoes online because of things not being like what is pictured. But this was exactly what was online and came in an Ugg shoe box well packed and everything.
310999,1,"These arrived in a few days in new condition. I took them out of the box and looked them over. As when I bought them I was skeptical they would fit, be comfortable and stay on. I put them on. Wow! I stood up. WOw! I walked around the den. WOW! They fit! They were comforable! They stayed on! Where have these shoes been all my life. I lounge in them, do chores in them and walk in them. Welcome to the 21st century feet."
129365,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
71614,1,"I love this shoe.. I have travelled the urban world in them , many miles logged on them and they still feel great... great buy..."
346520,0,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small. I should have gotten a 6 1/2 instead of a 6.THey look good though, isn't that what counts? haha!"
124277,1,"I've always liked LifeStride shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. I'll definitely buy a pair again, soon."
259892,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
209600,1,i am very pleased with my purchase! i purchased these boots for my sons birthday they arrived sooner than expected in great condition! i had standard shipping and they arrived two days after i placed my order which was great so that i could complete my sons wardrobe for his birthday party! they were in good condition and authenic timberland quality!!! i would highly reccomend this seller to someone else!
83841,1,"These were very nice, just what I was looking for, my gf loves reef flip-flops and swears by them! she loves this pair and weras them even in the winter :) shipping was very fast and the flips were in perfect condition"
340960,1,Always a good buy.. Grasshoppers are the best! Long wearing.. good quality! I prefer the leather but these are washable too.
21341,1,I LIKE THESE SHOES THE STYLE AND WEAR IS VERY COMFORTING. THEY CAN BE DRESS DOWN AND UP IN WHAT EVER YOU WEAR.
294535,0,These shoes are true to size and look very nice on. I recieved a few compliments on them as well. You can tell that they are made very well too. I was just under the impression that they would be comfortable for long wearing. The first few days they felt great but then they started to bother my feet. I purchased these in wide too! I still wear them but just not everyday. I must say that I do love the height though.
131350,1,This is my first pair of Reef sandles and I have found them to be very comfortable. They run a little small as I usually wear a 7.5 but ordered the 8 for a perfect fit.
23257,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
31380,1,"I bought these for my 13 month old son just before a trip to the beach and we wouldn't have had much fun without them. He could get them as sandy as imaginable and we would just rinse them off in the sink at the hotel. Beautiful!I thought he might have a hard time walking in them, but he learned pretty quickly and now he wears them almost everywhere. He can almost get them on himself!These shoes are a must for any busy toddler!"
335121,1,Fit and finish are good. Shoes are lightweight and seem well put together. Will edit review once shoes have some miles on them...
48118,1,"I wasn't sure at first how they would look or fit, it was the first time I've ordered crocs on the computer, I like to see my shoes and like to try them on.. But coming from Amazon I thought it would be okay.. I trust them.. Amazom haven't let me down yet.."
343079,0,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
50853,1,Looked all over and could not find these anywhere including the Vans outlet here locally. Arrived on time and fit great.Love my Vans!!!
387372,1,"The Mizuno Triple Jump Spike is the best spike for triple jump ever made!!This product is no longer availible in the UK and is also very difficult to get hold of throughout the world.Have Mizuno stopped making this product?? If so, it's a sin!!!!"
61391,1,"I have worn Hi-Tec boots for many years now. This is my third pair of Altitude boots. They are comfortable, durable and relatively inexpensive. The boots are great for day hikes these are a good boots for light to moderate loads. If you are looking for a stiff boot for heavy backpacking I would recommend looking at another model of boot. Hi-Tec makes other model boots specifically for backpacking with heavier loads."
54755,1,"I love this shoe. It is the same style that I had twenty years ago. The shoe is light weight, comfortable, and durable. I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely,csh"
132455,1,"First off, I'm not really a kid, but I don't want to sign up for an acount. Know that. I bought a pair a couple months ago. They obviously get kudos in the cool facter right off the bat. Then I put them to the real test. On the court. They are super comfortable and are still holding up great. They also breathe very well.This brings me to the only problems. Soon after I bought a pair, my friend did too. He plays in them not only on the hard-court, but on the black top when he's practicing also. Therefore he uses them A LOT. A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins. I've only heard of this happening to a couple people, but if you abuse your shows as much as my friend does, you might want to look else where. Also the sound of the pump is audible. Not terribly noticable, expecialy on the court.All in all, this is a great shoe and really encourage you buying it. Whether you want it for hoops or for style, it's sick no matter what."
168272,0,i bought these before seeing danner's comment on their web site that these boots are better for a narrow foot.i never thought i had a wide foot before but i purchased these in my normal size and they were tight on the edges and long in the toe.instead of re-ordering in a wide size i returned them and got one of danner's other lasts for a more typical sized foot.
85160,0,"I bought a pair of Keen sandals because pretty much everyone I know wears them and they looked really comfortable. Overall, I like them, but I've had better sandals for less money than I paid for my Keens:Pros: Comfort. I can walk all day in these sandals without foot fatigue, heel pain, or irritation from the straps. I ended up getting a half size larger because I wanted to be able to wear them with socks when it's cooler. You may look like a geek, but this is by far the most comfortable way to wear the Keens. A good, synthetic or wool hiking sock with these feel great, because your feet don't feel sweaty. They hold up well after repeated washes. I really like the protective toe cap. If you work somewhere that doesn't allow open-toed shoes, you may be able to get around that policy with these shoes. Perhaps that's why all my coworkers own a pair.Cons: Man I sweat like a pig with these sandals in hot weather. I don't care that they have an ""anti-microbial footbed"" these sandals will stink to high heaven with continued wear. I've washed them numerous times and the smell always comes back. This particular model has a leather footbed and is not marketed as a water shoe. I would not recommend getting them wet while wearing them. I was walking my dog when I got caught in torrential downpour that soaked my clothes and sandals. The best way I can describe the slipperiness of the insides of these sandals when wet is like a dog's rawhide chew toy or strips of raw bacon. Needless to say it's hard to run when your feet are sliding around inside your sandal."
52056,1,walking all day on cement is hard on feet and knees. these shoes make a big differance on how i feel at the end of my work shift. this is my second pair of these shoes and i will buy another pair as backup.
76624,1,"Very comfortable shoe, quiet walking, good for standing, nice for work (which is what I bought my second pair for). Looks good and super comfortable - and this in the context that I usually don't go far without orthotics in every shoe that will take them and am not wearing orthotics in these shoes."
28981,1,The quality was very good. The fit was exactly what I expected. The shoes needed no break-in and they were comfortable from the start. The shape was better than what I had before as they now fully accomodate my toes without squashing them together as was the case in the pointy shoes that I had.
145309,1,"all was great, product worked as expected and required. Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro"
225543,1,"I LOVE THESE CONVERSE! THEY ARE CLASSIC, COULDN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY'VE RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS!"
138218,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
103852,0,"this was the first time i bought shoes over the internet because my feet are usually hard to fit, but these fit great and are comfortable too."
358709,0,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
269606,1,"Since Rockport introduced the Men's ProWalker, I have purchased at least a dozen pairs. They are the most comfortable leisure shoe I have worn. They are durable and have a long life for everyday wearing. In today's economy, one can be sure of getting his money's worth in value."
192619,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
21224,1,This is a wonderful shoe. I had a hard time finding it until I went to Amazon and there it was. They are so comfortable and I feel safe in them as there is good support.
331791,1,"I was a bit leery about ordering online without trying the shoes on first, but the size was spot on! Also I ordered from Australia and was thrilled how quickly the order arrived. Will definitely use Amazon internationally again!"
60643,1,"This is my fourth pair in the last four years. I wear them for work, so approx 60 hours a week and I walk NON-stop. I truly wear holes in the soles. There are well made and SO light weight. They are comfortable and I NEVER have any foot pain. I tried buying a different brand a few weeks ago because they looked almost identical (they were $15 cheaper) and I regretted every minute of them for two weeks straight. I threw the other ones away and bought the tried and true! They are completely waterproof and wick away the moisture from my feet. I will never buy a different boot."
361554,1,"The crocs were gifts for a son, son-in-law and daughter-in-law, and they all loved them. Said that they were the most comfortable thongs that they have ever worn.Don Vogler"
137578,1,"I just purchased my old stand-by, traditional Keds from Amazon. Loved the price ($20 cheaper than the Keds site) and they arrived at my home within 3 days. My feet are happy to be in their old comfortable standards. Thanks"
225653,1,"I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!"
368404,1,"First time ordering shoes online so I was a bit skeptical, but I'm glad I did. Shoes came as shown in the image, the size of the DVS shoes might be slightly bigger than what I was used to.Shoes came with 2 sets of laces, black/white.Came with a bunch of stickers and key chains but just fluff.The actual shoes have been good to me, been wearing them for more than a year now. As with all white shoes they do get dirty pretty fast.The grip of the shoes leaves something to be desired, but I'm not exactly a skater so I can't say if they work well in a ""skating"" environment. I've played football in the park with them and they held up ok, but I wouldn't recommend doing anything rigorous with them like.. hiking up a steep hill."
183002,1,I love these shoes. Nice height and heel is right thickness (not stiletto). Comfortable to wear and look cute!
383650,0,"I though this was a comfortable shoe that's why I bought it but it really stiff in the arches that every time I go walking in it my feet hurt but maybe i just have weak arches it's kind of lose in the heels but maybe i bought it too wide, hopefully it gets comfortable after a while."
235501,1,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
270885,1,"They look great and feel ok for long periods of time but the leather is very stiff, shoe horn mandatory.ciao"
312701,0,"I bought the same size as the ones I already had, but they were too tight. I went into the Crocs web site and questioned it. I received no reply or explanation. I discovered that as I wore these clogs, they stretched a little and became more true to size. I am disappointed that the company didn't have the courtesy to reply, so I will not give them the courtesy of another purchase.I had no problem with Amazon."
255813,1,I bought this shoe for my daughter who is in pre school. It looks great with her uniform and she hasn't complained of any discomfort:-)
230730,1,"I must say, these boots are very high quality. Although I wish I would of ordered a different color because all black does not look good. Actually, I think I ordered the blue one but got the black ones. But I can't really remember and returning the package and getting a new package uhh too much work. Oh well. Anyways, these boots are good nonetheless."
85801,1,"This purchase was an exact replacement of a worn out pair of Crocs. So I was sure of size and fit. The new pair fit perfectly. Crocs are a great product but sizes between styles can vary, so purchasing online without trying on is risky."
19306,1,"I inherited a pair of these shoes from my Dad back in '87 and have been keeping an eye out for a pair since. Original pair I had were blue colorscheme, but the red's a nice changeup. These shoes are not for people with wide feet, I'm sure the leather will stretch out after repeated wearings, but they tend to run on the narrow side. A potential drawback I encountered is the tendency for the soles to squeak when on polished floors. They're dope, i've been looking for them for ages and i'm considering buying a second pair (seeing as they're on sale, odds are good they're getting phased out again and I don't want to wait another 16 years to find them)."
164986,1,"I have bought Easy Spirit shoes for years, so I knew the quality of this product. I was not disappointed. Shoes arrived in reasonable time, in perfect condition. Color and size as requested. Only wish I could get some other colors at this GREAT rate!"
215493,1,"Several years ago I had problems running to include back pain and shin splints and was limited to running 2 or 3 miles at a time. I absolutely hated running, and I attribute this to ill-fitting shoes. After lots of searching for a new pair of shoes, I was recommended a pair of New Balance shoes...can't remember the exact model, but it was a predecessor to the 856. Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring. Good to see they're still available."
89951,1,I bought a pair of these in 1999 as work shoes; at the time I worked at a dress shop and was a teaching student. They were wonderful for commuting on the bus and student teaching. But it's been 13 years now and the shoes have seen better days. The inside is completely ruined and they have a slightly funky smell (as 13 yr old shoes often will) but they're still the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I keep meaning to buy a new pair but never seem to get around to it. I love these shoes. Every few years I get the urge to toss them out (they're old and dirty and ripped up inside) but the moment I try them on again I remember why I haven't before. They are SOOOO comfy!!!Favorite pair of shoes EVER!
383502,1,Very comfortable and cute shoe. I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size. I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look.
202974,1,"I bought this Sandal for my Son In Law for his Birthday. He had been asking for them for a while, so he was very excited when he received them. He says that they are sooo comfortable. And I like this olive/grey. It ges with eerything."
306905,1,"I got mine a size larger because I really like comfort. Plus when you fly and your feet swell up, it's a plus. Very comfortable shoes."
361147,1,"This is a very comfortable shoe and is adjustable to allow for a high instep, unlike other shoes that go as far up the foot. It's also great if you have feet of differing sizes/widths as each shoe is adjustable. They truly are ""versatile"" sandals."
364526,1,Converse's are classic. they are the shoes people are always going to wear. i like the high tops better though
326349,1,"I have been running on top of the line New Balance for over 15 years. I'm overweight and pronated. As a 50+ year-old runner, I'm more interested in running tomorrow than if I got a personal best today. New Balance minimizes my injuries better than the other four top shoes I've tried from four other brands."
327142,0,"It took 3 weeks to get to me, and the other shoe I ordered never came (*they discontinued it after delaying delivery for 2 weeks). The shoe looked good in person but the size is really off! I normally wear a 10, but this size 10 was so large that I couldn't even keep it on my foot! I would've exchanged it but they are out of the smaller size. Overall I would buy again but in one size smaller."
148931,0,The shoe is exactly what it is supposed to be. The only issue i had is that the felt on the front of each shoe started to come off after just a few rehearsals. I glued them back on and they are fine now. A little annoyed I had to do that for the amount these shoes cost
322659,1,I love these size 8 and a half Capezio ballet slippers. They are perfect for me for lounging around the house.
102815,1,"I was glad that I found this shoes as Amazon had it with free shipping. Got it for less than 35 bucks (shipped). Anyway, I took to consideration all the comments and ordered one size up and it works beautifully. I wish it's a bit wide though but it does not cost a major inconvenience for me. I used it for my Zumba classes and it is great. I used to control my movements because the tennis shoes I used to wear sticks to the floor and any wrong move may injure my knees. With this one, I still have to do a bit of controlling but it's more on slipping depending on the dance floor surface. In my case, it's a shiny wood flooring."
157814,1,"These were ordered as a gift in a size 12. Yes, they had them. The came beautifuly wrapped and arrived within a few days from order. Yes, I waited until the last min to order and they arrived just in time for Holidays. Reasonable and I didn't have to leave my home. Perfect for basketball! They were well received! Now, my daughter wants a pair. Love Amazon!"
361911,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
179255,1,"Bought the book as a gift and the receiver loved it. The item came quickly and as described, great deal."
253103,0,"I thought these were really cool. A great retro-cool look (made me want to drink Mai-Tais and listen to cool jazz) but the sizing was not right for my foot, so I returned them. I tried 2 sizes (I burned up the savings by having to pay return shipping to Amazon - some competing sites don't make you pay to return shoes......); the first my regular size which was too big, and then a half size smaller which was too small. As popular as these shoes are, my guess is that the problem is with my feet, not the shoes. It probably could have been helped if the shoes had an extra row of eyelets so the strings would go up just that much higher. But, I don't blame Clarks for not altering a classic."
78106,1,I absolutely love my Minnetonka Moccasins!!! They are so comfortable that I don't want to take them off. It is like going barefoot while wearing shoes. Will probably order the boots next month.
302484,0,"The crocs are okay it's the seller that is not okay! The crocs broke second day of vacation. I wrote the seller. The seller told me they would send extra clips whioh was fine but if these broke, I would have to contact the factory. They (the seller) DO NOT stand by the products they sell. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! ELECTRIKID - not sure of the exact spelling."
87195,1,"Excellent vendor, fast delivery, great sandal. I've had both knees replaced and sandals are usually hard on my knees. Low quality sandal may look the same but have a harsh jarring when walking. I'll will buy another pair from this vendor when these start to ware."
40913,1,This is my third pair of Ginger's over several years and I love them. They are soft and comfy and wear extremely well even when getting wet a lot.
276939,1,"At half a century old, I've been camping for as long as I can remember. When I had to start buying my own boots, I went cheap to save money. I got exactly what I paid for! Now don't get me wrong, if you need reliable foot protection to go caving one weekend, K-Mart and WalMart offer excellent choices. Personally, I would rather drop $70 on a great pair of boots and wear them 2 years than spend $30 every 6 months.I've owned 3 pair of Timberlands. The first shrunk too small while drying next to the fire. My bad. The bottom of the 2nd pair, in my opinion, wore out prematurely. It wasn't until the 3rd that I realized the sole was simply an inferior material. Hello Hi-Tec! I fell in love with my first pair immediately.ProsThere was no break-in period, not even for my EEE wide dogs! I wear them till they fall apart. Then I purchase another. Years later, another. The Altitude IV waterproof hiking boot has great ankle support, it's fairly light weight, definitely waterproof, somehow breathes well even for the aroma my feet produce, the speed laces are absolutely a plus and the soles have a more aggressive pattern than comparable brands. (Did I mention I use mine for caving?)ConsConstruction and durability - absolutely NONE!Availability - I only wished more shoe stores carried them so prices would be more competitive. Thank goodness for Amazon.Would I recommend this product?A good pair of boots is an &#34;investment&#34;. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. When I did the math, the only correct answer is Hi-Tec!"
251412,1,"I bought this headband because my hair was getting too long and kept hitting my face when I ran, but this thing works like a charm! Keeps the hair out of my face, as well as sweat.It's stretchy, comfortable, and completely adjustable. Plus I look like a ninja now when I run, which is always a plus.Overall, I love it and I would highly recommend it. Very inexpensive for the value it gives!"
219759,1,"These shoes are a classic and are very comfortable, but, you have to be careful or they will rip. mine ripped in the first month"
21644,1,I have used Easy Spirit when I show my dogs for several years. They are light weight and have good traction when moving my dog. I wore my last pair for several years until my new puppy chewed them.
81163,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
961,1,"I bought these boots mainly for commuting in lousy weather. After the sole of my last pair of snow boots ripped during our last snow storm, I gave these a shot while shoveling our driveway. Two hours later, my feet were still as warm as they were when I put them on. These boots are great hikers, but also are hands down the warmest pair I have ever worn in the snow."
215836,1,Found them to very comfortable for walking. Only drawback is I can't drive with them on. I drive barefooted
105400,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
272808,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
216360,1,"Excellent shoe, i bought this forsch the ool, My daughter love them. I had the same kind of shoes for my daughter and are very good shoes."
330979,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
86239,1,I bought these shoes because I heard from other nurses how great they were and I needed a leather shoe for safety sake. I am so pleased with them that I now have been recommending them to everyone.
282653,1,"Rainbows flip-flops are the best. They are a little more expensive than other pairs, but they are well worth it."
173696,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
210221,1,"I love the look of this shoe! It's slightly narrow at the toes, but otherwise breaks in easily. I seemed to have broke mine in with three wears."
303976,0,Good for folks with wide feet. I have average width and it looked quite large on me. You can probably size down.
231461,1,"This Teva flip flop is great. I have it in black also. With narrow feet, it is hard to find sandals that will stay on. These work quite well with the extra straps. They are also soft with good cushion. If they actually came in narrow or were adjustable they would be perfect."
229697,1,"I am a woman and I love these shoes. I played soccer for many years in school and originally got them for practical use. My first pair lasted me 7 years. These shoes are really well made, the leather is very high quality plus they are cool, classic and functional. If you are getting these for soccer I would say get the long tongue (more control over the ball), if you just want these for the look the short tongue is fine. I actually have the Samba K's, kangaroo leather version at the moment and I was really upset to see that they have discontinued them. I have read that the K's are incredibly durable and the leather just molds to your foot in a unique way. I think they look as good now as they did 5 years ago. These shoes do run narrow, so I usually get a half size larger and that works for me since I have wider feet. Overall you cannot go wrong with these. They are worth any price IMO."
3480,1,"This is my fifth set! These boots never fail me. If your looking for a great fitting, affordable and durable boot then these are for you! Thanks Hi Tec for the great product."
267653,1,Its a nice shoe... it beats the shoes I had been wearing before. I got the wide version since my feet are a bit wide. I don't like how shoes get narrow at the tip. They need to make some wide toed hiking shoes.
151026,1,"Shoes were fantastic, got to me quickly, and exactly as Amazon promised. The only thing I added to them were some SuperFeet insoles, which you can also buy on Amazon. These should be fit to you by a foot specialist to determine your exact foot type."
159110,1,"Originally went for 15s as I usually wear a 14 1/2 or 15, but this was way way too big. Got the 14's instead and they are actually a little long in the toe. Absolutely no support in these shoes at all, not that I was really expecting any. Just wanted to try them out. They are great as far as outfitting goes...they go with anything. But, do not plan on doing any major hiking in them. They are casual shoes and are for just that...being casual! Overall not a bad shoe though!"
264793,1,"I was looking for a ""Rocky"" boot that I previously owned that was very much like this style. I had them for about 8 years and paid about $150.00 for them.I loved them. I wanted to replace them but found they were not made anymore,I was very disappointed. I came across the ""Browning"" boot and bought them for $85.00 with some reservations..how could an $85.00 boot compare to a ""Rocky"" $150.00 boot? I could tell no difference. The ""Browning"" boot was light,waterproof and warm. Only time will tell how well it holds up."
27217,1,I always purchase these sneakers for nearly 10 yrs! I love them the only thing is I pay the same in the reebok outlet and Modells as I did on amazon! They are great! Also very hard to find in any store other than reebok
35654,1,These shoes are fabulous in every since of the word. They are comfortable and a great conversation piece.
126341,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
332400,1,"This shoe is just right. It is very comfortable to wear, true to size, and looks good. I will probably buy another pair."
100033,1,"Exactly what I ordered, on time in pristine condition......better by far than from shoe store."
121237,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice. They were a good fit, I ordered a half size larger then what I wear because I wear a heavy sock and needed the extra room. I told some of my other Santa friends about these and they each got a pair too. We all wore them at our Santa school in Santa Claus, Indiana and were they ever a big hit with the other Santa's. Everything was sent as described and I will buy from again."
348201,1,"I bought these for my husband and he loves them. They fit well and they are very comfortable. I hope they will be sturdy as well, and they seem to be holding up quite well."
253235,1,"These boots are stylish and rugged, pure class. They fit true to size, in my opinion. Some of my favorite kicks."
255490,1,"I have worn these shoes for the past 5 years, and never once have I been disappointed with the quality. I have owned at least 10 pair, and the only reason I end up buying new a pair is because they just get dirty. I even wash them repeatedly (which should shorten the life of the shoe, but does not) and they still look good. You just can't beat this shoe when it comes to wearing it casually, it matches everything, and is very comfortable. As long as they make these, I will continue to buy them."
175094,1,"My wife, like many women has a closet full of shoes that are too tight, too loose or have some other distracting feature that will almost eliminate their being worn. These sandals, however are and have been her favorites for a very long time. So long that they finally wore out and these were their replacements. Having peripheral neuropathy, my wife needs all the footwear comfort she can muster up. While these sandals are not exactly for dress wear they fully meet her everyday needs. Guess we had better order out more as i`m afraid they may stop making them and then we will be ""up the creek with no paddle""."
157415,1,Thank you for sending this fast and correct! These are my daughter's favorite shoes and when her old pair finally got holes in the soles she put these on her Birthday list. She unwrapped them and immediately they were on her feet!
185115,0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."
360839,1,I am normally a 7 so i ordered an 8 and yes these shoes are pretty slippery but you can buy stickers that you can put at the bottom of the shoe! i love them and think they were a very good price
352650,1,This seems to be the new fad in our school. My granddaughter askedfor them for her birthday and was very happy to receive them.
6602,1,I got my shoes on time and they look great! I wear a size 10 and was nervous about whether would be loose or tight but they were the perfect size. They are very comfortable and Sperry makes a great product so they should last. These would look great with any casual clothing and the price was reasonable as well.
25783,1,"I ordered these shoes from Amazon. They came packaged well but kind of slow on the shipping. I normally can order an item from Amazon and have it within a week. I ordered the New Balance 574 and it took close to three weeks for me to receive my shoes. The good thing is, I was able to track the shoes via the Amazon tracking system which gave me at least peace of mind. The shoes looked exactly like the photo and were brand new, never worn. The New Balance 574 is an amazing shoe. I needed to get a new shoe and a friend recommended I try a New Balance shoe. I must say, this is one of the most comfortable shoes around. Went to a store where they measure your foot to make sure I get the right shoe. It truly does make a difference. If you are considering purchasing this shoe, I suggest this as an option. I hope this review helps. YMMV... NEOSOUL."
347128,1,"I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!"
350028,0,These shoes are a little tough. Not good for walking at all.But they look good and fit well.
139447,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
209740,1,"I love the way these boots flex with my foot, as comfortable as my Birks but only warmer and water resistance"
32651,1,"This is my daughters second pair of Mizuno and she loves them...plan on buying another! They fit right out of the box like a glove, very comfortable and stand up to all the foot action!"
142116,2,I purchased a pair size 7 1/2. The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes. These shoes are very narrow.
186734,1,"I absolutely wore my other pair out. I have wide,high arch feet and hard to fit.These are great walking shoes"
247288,1,"These shoes are for me, although I am a woman. I needed shoes I could run outside in without worrying about them coming apart. The price was great and the shoes are comfortable."
3288,1,"Purchased these boots originally for my son (the outdoor / boy scout / hiker) ... then went camping but my old boots (Vasque Clarion Impact Gore-Tex Hiking Boot ) which were tight even at a size 11 W... (I wear a 10.5 EEE) ... I decided to try these boots HiTec Boots at size 13M... thinking, why not give them a chance... on a weekend camp out in mud, rain and lots of walking (a Mountain Man theme camp out). The boots fit great... granted a bit long, but the width was just right, I replaced the insole with a pair of Spenco(r) Heavy Duty Insoles... they were comfortable and they kept my feet dry. So, I did the next logical thing, bought a pair for me, same size, and all... word of advise, I bought these in 11 W, they were to thin, I then bought size 13M... maybe it was just my feet, but they work for me... with a good insole, and a great lace technique, you have a good boot... enjoy."
137980,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
197020,1,I have a finished basement than can get pretty cold so I went to look for something that was good and affordable. I got it in these slippers . The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is that the small pulling tab at back of one slipper ripped off the 2nd time I put them on. No biggie though.
367138,1,"This is a great device. I gave it to my husband for Christmas 2010. He just looked at and thought, why is she giving me this. We live in Utah and trail run in the snow every night as well as skate ski and cross country ski. He pulls this device out, puts his glove and shoes, or boot in the appropriate places turns it on and it ready to go again in a few hours. It is not small enough to pack in a suitcase for travel, but I think that he might try to bring it will us on ski trips away with the extended family. It is relatively quiet. The bathroom fan makes more noise than this while in operation. I would buy another one in a heartbeat for myself or recommend it."
188121,1,keeps your feet warm i suggest that you spray with silicone b4 use IF you can and then evry month or so depending use and wweather conditions
264709,1,"Great comfortable shoe with nice style, only thing I did not like is the hint of a seam on the side"
87526,1,"This is my 4th pair of the Propet Slip-on and I'll buy more when I need them. I have black and white. They are good looking, comfortable, durable, and an excellent value. Size options are excellent and since I wear a wide width this shoe suits me just fine.It is without reservation that I recommend this product for purchase. Incidentally, this is a truly light shoe although the picture might suggest otherwise."
288901,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
149358,1,I'm a picky person but might i say they are comfy & came in less then 48hrs..i am impressed. Good service!
269893,1,"I have owned many pairs of prowalkers over the years. I currently have a black, brown and white pair. I purchased these to replace the white pair I have had for several years. The pair I replaced were still in serviceable condition but had lost their shine. I am very pleased with the new pair. I see no noticable difference in quality over the older ones. They were very comfortable out of the box. I delayed writing this review for a few weeks to give them a good workout. I would not hesitate to purchase another pair and probably will be replacing the brown pair shortly"
290270,0,"I ordered these boots because they say they are 12"" but they are really 10"". They are also made from thin leather."
268944,0,"These were a good deal for the price paid, though they seem to run a half size smaller than labeled."
118447,1,"Not only is this a good looking sandal, it is sooo comfortable. The heel height is perfect too! Have already recommended to a friend."
226789,1,Bought item for my bro...so all i can say is delivery was on time...Thank You!
187930,1,"I bought these for my 93 year old aunt who was being moved from a nursing home to assisted living. She has had problems with swelling in her feet and ankles and needs extra wide shoes. The velcro makes it easy for her to put them on and off, they give good support when she walks with her walker, and she says they feel good."
333049,1,I wish I had seen the 1/2 size larger recommendation. Mine are 1/2 size too small! Nice boots though.
379769,0,"I ordered a size larger as recommended and it turned out to be too large for me. Half a size larger would have been better. The shoes feel comfortable, except that the sole of the shoes feels slippery. I was afraid I would slip and fall, so I returned the shoes."
388348,1,I do like those shoes and myself I didn't have any bad experience descibed by another customers. This pair feels much more comfortable then other thong sandals I have. I didn't get any blisters from stitches and a jewel is still on after wearing this pair all summer.
358622,1,"After having tried several name brand tennis shoes I still haven't found anything better than Reeboks, not only are they the most comfortable shoes I have found for daily wear but they are also the best quality, and have the best durability. Also, Marcus uniforms ships them very quickly."
308210,1,"What can I say?I love this shoe,there awesome.They made me feel like I was walking on air everytime,I really want another pair of this great shoes.I love them so much,I might just buy 2 pairs lol."
122550,1,I wear these at work as a nurse on those hard floors. I find the usual Skechers comfort right out of the box and recommend them to my coworkers. It is not unusual to find 4 or 5 of us wearing Skechers at work --just depends on which style is on sale.
34459,0,"The shoe fits fine, but I need shoes with rubber soles as i am handicapped.Daniel Green Women's Meg SlipperI hope Daniel Green has a slipper that has a rubber sole. I ordered the product from Amazon."
22945,1,"These are by far the best pair of rocky boots yet. This only my third pair in 19 years, that's how long they last."
223880,1,"I'm wearing these bad boys right now. These sneakers have a sexy look to them, and you can't go wrong with classic chucks at this price. Buy them! Every one should have black and white sneakers in their collection. They feel great, and I haven't had any problems with them yet. This is well worth the purchase. :-)"
328332,1,These are one of the most comfortable dress shoes I have ever worn. I normally wear tennis shoes being a nurse and so I know what is comfortable. I bought these softspots after buying two pairs of shoes that were just so uncomfortable and produced blisters. Now I am not going to dread wearing dress shoes and now make them my go to shoes.SoftSpots Women's Stephanie Pumps
74431,1,"Perfect shoes for toddlers who have to do things by themselves. The hot pink is very bright and pretty, and they seem to run true to size. Being able to pull the strap behind the foot helps keep the shoes on when I am carrying my toddler as well. This is the third pair of Crocs we have had, and we will keep replacing them as they are outgrown. Great, simple product."
57524,1,I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more! Thrilled to pieces!
135297,1,"Just what I expected. Awesome. I wear a 11.5 in most shoes and got a 12 here on purpose so I could wear thick winter socks. Even with the socks they are a bit roomy in the toe- so believe that &#34;run a half size large&#34; thing for Converse i guess. Other than that, this Pair of Chucks are exactly right on."

55624,0,"I purchased a white pair of Keds tennis shoes recently. When they arrived, they looked wonderful and fit like a glove...I just loved them! After a week or so, they needed washed, so I put them in the washing machine with a load of whites and used cold water and a name brand laundry detergent. Imagine my surprise when I removed them from the washer to air dry, and discovered they were now a light blue color! Evidently the dark, royal blue foot liner 'bleeds'. It looks like I have a blue pair of Keds tennis shoes now..."
31836,1,"These shoes are pretty great. They're very ventilated, very comfortable (the second most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned) and they do their job. They're so cute, too. They're perfect for the summer time because they don't look stupid with skirts or shorts."
294564,1,"I bought this sandal after I broke my toe, and I wanted a sandal with toe protection, and I wasn't disappointed. This sandal is really comfortable. It has great arch support and a nicely coushioned sole, and it is both cute and functional. Looks great with shorts, capris and pants, but a little too ""clunky"" for skirts. Very sporty."
238444,1,I recieved my product in a timely manner. Excellent prices I couldn't believe I got a pair of Converse cheerleading shoes that cheap I was amazed.Would recommend this site to anyone.
116513,1,"These shoes worked out great for my three year old daughter just starting dance class. They are comfortable on her, and look so cute."
261738,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
305166,1,This is defenitely one great pair of boots! It's very soft and comfortable. I recommed to use it with long socks.
253318,1,"I've had these boots for about a week now. They really haven't taken too long to break in, and I really like them. They are a great casual/dress shoe for winter. They are even more comfortable than I had expected!"
44230,1,"These boots were very nice and appeared to have quality features, however, the fit was too snug. I don't believe the medium width would work for the average foot. If you usually wear a narrow width, I think these boots would work for you!"
231853,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
240317,1,"great shoe at a great price, classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit, fits snug so may want to size up"
236394,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
389610,1,Came on time! I love these sneakers i wear these and the blue ones all the time. They look great.
183288,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
171932,1,"bought this product for my husband for christmas and he likes it alot. its not only comfortable but also has rubber treading on the bottom, which makes it great to wear even outside."
203732,1,"These are the most comfortable sandals in the world. My wife only wears this type, and she wears them out. I should buy multiple pair at a time, but one pair every year ain't bad. Amazon has the best price compared to spending almost twice in a retail store. Thanks for the fast shipping!"
340264,1,"I love these shoes. They are not true ""athletic"" shoes and work really well in my casual work environment without looking too casual and clunky. I am a woman and still want to maintain some sense of style without sacrificing comfort. These shoes do it for me."
53064,1,These shoes are very cute. I can't wait to see my friends baby in them (right now she is still a bit too small for the shoes). The shoes also came in a nice box with a clear cover to display them.
307693,1,"After searching the malls for authentic Chuck Taylor Kelly Green Hi-tops, with no luck, I wised up and went to the [...] web site, where I not only found Kelly Green Hi-tops for my son, I also used their unique design your own shoes feature, to design a pair of custom high tops just for me. We are both thrilled with our finds. Chuck Taylor's are the shoe of choice in our household, I even got my conservative, old school hubby into a pair of Chuck Taylor leather Hi-tops."
161085,1,"We could not find these anywhere in the stores for under $60.00. I was very happy with the price and the delivery was right on time. They were a gift and it was exactly what she wanted.Thanks,Theresa"
367536,1,"These shoes fit well, are comfortable but do not last a real long time since like many other brands the knobs on the tread of the shoe are hollow and as they wear down a hole developes and when walking in snow or water puddles your feet get wet from water coming in through the sole of the shoe. But at this low price I just replace them when the soles get a little worn."
297295,1,"Very comfortable; could be worn without sox. I've been wearing mine daily for 2 months in a fatty acid refinery (greases and oil, high temperatures,etc) and they holding up well. difficult to keep clean because they 're sort of suede, but as of now, I'd buy 'em again. And they ARE brown, a fawn color actually."
131204,2,"The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years, however, the two new pairs (black and brown leather) were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe. The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks. The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China."
245578,2,I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same. They didn't last for two months. Dont be fool and look for another one.
360803,1,purchased this shoe for my daughter's choir performance. she told me that it was comfortable & can go on the whole day without any issues. buy it & you'll like it.
168132,1,"Came fast, looked better than the pic showed. Was a little tight at first but they loosen up in no time. would bye again."
245406,1,The images of the product did not match with the images of the product listed on Amazon. I do not paying for something that does not look like the image. As well as the condition of the shoes. One of the shoes has some type of indention on the side shoe. Mind you the condition of the shoe was listed as brand new on Amazon web page.
375193,1,"I have owned a pair of these boots since 2003 and wear them every day on the job as a flight nurse / paramedic. I have put these boots through the ringer and they are just as comfortable today as the day I bought them. Seven years later they are still waterproof and I don't hesitate to step in water. While some might say these boots are a little pricey, I don't think $32.00 a year is to much to pay for a top quality pair of boots. The best part about these boots is the ability to have them re-soled or completely refurbished, which I have not had to do yet, but I won't hesitate to do when the time comes."
12402,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
321916,0,"I bought these for myself needing a full sole shoe rather quickly. I am an adult who bought 8m considering that is my street size. My feet to be average with occassional slippage in heel area. For that I did expect to have minimal fit problems but the heel strap & sides are way too big. The sides particularly gap which makes it annoying/unsightly. I would recommend bloch's danshoz over these in my opinion. Such a shame too, these are cute."
29416,1,I was sad that I could not find these sneakers in the stores. They are so easy to put on and so comfortable to wear. I was excited to find Amazon had them. They came very quickly. It is a great buy for a comfortable slip on sneaker.
235984,1,Very satisfied with purchase. Very quick shipping! Hopefully these will hold up just as well as all of my other rainbow sandals! Can't beat a great pair of flip flops!
347528,1,"There are certain brands that I, and most people I know, can always depend on to deliver a good product ... Levis, Lee's, Fossil, Red Wing, Nike, etc. ... Converse is definitely in that group of brands ... AND, that's just one thing that's great about Converse... Another is thing that I love about Converse is hoe much I love... Yes love... their initiative to take their shoes and make a big STEP further with the wonderful fun and creative styles and designs they now do with them! It's great that one can even go on their site and do their own custom artwork to bring out one's own style personality! Now that's innovative and being in touch with customers!I remember back in the 70s when I was a tween that they were about mainly basketball before they took off as everyday comfortable footwear... As it moved more to that I saw a lot of designs and artwork starting to appear on the canvas shoes... Ya' know 70's stuff like peace signs, and flowers, and rainbows in psychedelic neon colors... Ha!I'm sure some saw it as graffiti or, like when the style trend was to get jeans to have that really worn look... To the extent that some took scissors to their brand new jeans and cut holes in the knees... Funny really.. But it was fun and that's why fashion and trends are fun because individual style and personality can be expressed to the world without saying a word! It wouldnt surprise me at all to find out that now they are employed by Converse to develop and design the more whimsical shoes that make for ""Happy Feet"" indeed!Anyway,Kudos to Converse for really getting that and making a good shoe that also has pazzazzzz! Also, as far as the transaction of my purchase at Amazon.com for these ... It was the same as the many many other purchases I've had before... On Amazon I know I'll find what I'm shopping for... At a better price than out and about the malls and shops ... And, if I pay attention and use all of the benefits and promotions they provide to help with cost... I truly end up on the bargain end of my consumerism... So, let's see ... I've gone way past 20 words now... Let's just say I thought it said 200 not 20! Ha!!"
348302,1,"I bought these new without tags. There was a minor scuff on the toe of one that disappeared with the first polishing, I didn't even have to sand it out.These are beautiful, comfortable, warm, waterproof. With a high shine they look like a million bucks. My feet have never been happier to spend hours in deep snow. They are very military looking, a little clunky, not ideal for running in but not terrible either. The leather is supple, the safety toes barely noticeable while wearing them.We used to drool when looking at these at the PX. I'm so glad to have these for my Northern Michigan winters. Made in the U.S.A."
381859,1,This is a great sneaker in any color. Narrow is pretty narrow however. You can not go wrong with this shoe.
267199,1,"I've had 4 pairs of these boots, two brown and two black since 2007 when I started walking over a mile and a half to work. I don't walk that far on a regular basis anymore, but since then they've also been the only shoes I can stand in reasonably comfortably all day at work also. I have a foot issue (accessory navicular bone) and the vast majority of shoes make it ache by the end of a day or two of standing. They may be a bit heavy and not the most attractive or professional footwear out there but they absolutely get the job done and my feet are happier for it! The waterproofing is also effective and has kept my feet dry hiking, changing garbages, replacing headlights, etc. through rain or snow.The only negative comment I have is that possibly ordering online doesn't get the best quality control. They're still comfortable enough but the most recent pair, which I purchased through Amazon instead of in person at a store, have a ""funny"" spot that the other pairs did not. It doesn't usually bother me but I had to get used to it and don't feel I should have."
161641,1,"Product arrived early, in good condition, and as described. This shoe does run larger than the size you normally wear. I read somewhere to order one size smaller but I ordered 1/2 size smaller and inserted a cushioned insole. It fits perfect and wears nice."
271936,1,"As a professional I sit on my can all day in the IT department but spend my weekends working hard around the house. I've been looking for a quality work boot but have been having a hard time finding something that fits well. I found that the quality boots were well over $100 regardless of their country of origin. I figure if I'm spending this much on a boot I better get a pair made in the US. Found these at my local Army Surplus store on sale for $110. Super fit, very well made (you can just see it) and they look good too. Happy that they're made by US workers (not really concerned if the worker is union or not). Just goes to show if try hard enough you still can find quality goods at a quality price still made in the US."
364903,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
151842,1,I bought these for my wife and daughter. They liked them from the minute they put them on. No break in period. Look great with jeans.
111203,1,"I've been wearing these boots for 4 years now, I wear them everyday and walk all day so I wear them out in 6 months. But worth every penny. No breaking them in, they are comfortable from day 1."
63264,1,"After always wearing athletic shoes, I finally returned to my beloved Keds. They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy, clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes. I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do."
23393,0,"Before purchasing these, I read several reviews and determined that these are often sized a bit small. As I normally wear a 12 or 12 shoe, I ordered the size 13. It was way too small, so I sent it back for a 14. The 14 I could get on, but it was still too small for comfort. As that's the largest size they sell, I'll be ordering another brand.These flip flops are also very hefty. The soles are very thick, and somewhat heavy. That may be a good or bad thing, depending on your desires. For me, it's a bad thing, as I'm looking for a lightweight pair of beach and shower flip flops to carry with me as I travel, and the added weight is not a welcome thing. If they had fit me, I would have kept them anyway.The construction appears solid, but as I have only worn them for about 30 seconds before shipping them back, I cannot comment on the true durability."
118498,1,"KN socks are indescribably soft. These were a well thought out gift from my daughter. I put them on and cozed on the couch. My feet felt like they were floating, numb to gravity. I was stunned at how different and wonderful slippers cound feel. It seemed a travesty to use them to walk on the floor, so I save them for precious, comfy moments."
163427,1,"I've tried lots of sandals in my day, but I have to say that overall, Chaco makes the best. Although the toe-loop takes some getting used to, it helps provide great support for the forefoot. The single strap is easy to adjust, providing comfort for the entire foot.Also, you gotta love the vegetarian construction...good to see that Chaco has certified vegetarians building their shoes."
204614,1,Love these Flip Flops. So comfortable and wear very well. I like the cloth piece that goes between the toes - never hurts.
48637,1,"Although the heel on these boots look kind of high, they are actually really comfortable and stable to walk in. I have weak ankles, so I was a little worried about it, but they have pretty good support. Make sure that you wear long socks otherwise your skin gets pretty sweaty in the boots. The only complaint that I have was that the tongue seemed to be a little too skinny. The boot fit around my leg and it's not like I have fat legs, but I had to make sure to tie them tight so that the skin didn't show from under the tongue."
254184,1,"buenos zapatos, excelente producto y llego a tiempo, por lo tanto lo recomiendo cien por ciento. saludos a todos ( a b c d )"
112288,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
320769,1,These boots are amazing! The most comfy boots I have ever bought and they are a great price. From the first minute I put them on until the end of the first day they have been amazing!
47211,1,"Really happy with my purchase. This is the second pair of Propet' I've purchased. The first pair was a short all weather boot. I love the side zipper and the wide sizing. The second pair is a pair of sandals, brick color is great. Comfy, good support."
311528,1,"Awesome shoes that I've bought several times over the years. I love the nondescript style and the (somewhat) retro look. Low key, nothing flashy but very cool.They're getting harder to find. Here's hoping Reebok keeps making these."
103765,0,"I had to put a foot pad thing in these to keep my foot from sliding forward. They are versatile but the side straps sometimes twist a little and look a little awkward. Overall, not bad once the ball-of-the-foot pads were in."
379614,0,"I got the shoes for a musical I'm in. The sizing is definitely weird. My street shoe size is usually a 9 or 9.5, so I ordered 9, 9.5, and 10. I also have pretty wide feet. Turns out the 9.5 fits fine and I had nothing to worry about. The ball of the foot area is REALLLL snug though, and I ordered the wide size. Hopefully they stretch out with wear."
312472,2,These boots are not crafted very well. The detail leather has cuts that are sewn over and I believe I paid full price for seconds quality. whats worse they were almost $40.more than the last ones I got.dont expect too much!
228238,1,Came on time! I love these sneakers i wear these and the blue ones all the time. They look great.
52591,1,I have been using these shoes for about 10 years - they are amazing and the price thru Amazon was good. I am older and this shoe helps people that have had knee replacements or are not perfect anymore to be able to walk straight and without any problems.
321318,0,I was happy when I received it the next day after I ordered it but it turned out not that comfortable as canvass slippers. It is the first time I'd tried leather slippers. But I think it will last a long time.
147870,1,"These boots were a gift for my daughter for Christmas. They came quickly, and packaged to withstand gale-force winds. The boots are well made and warm. I would suggest buying waterproofing to keep them nice. She loves them. The cost is a bit much, but the workmanship looks great. Also, watch the sizing. I was told they are cut large. I ordered one size smaller than she wore and the fit was perfect."
134108,1,"Shoes are excellently made, they're extremely comfortable and the leather is one very shiney; not a cheap imitation. If you have wide feet and want durable, great quality and price boots, these are the one!!! I bought them for my small brother who has Down Syndrome and he simply loves them. I even bought him an extra pair of the same model. Previously I had bought other SAO boots in stores here in Puerto Rico and they've all turned out a great purchase. But, that was years ago and now SAO shoes are sort of hard to find here, so I searched these hard to find shoes through the internet and thank God I found them here!!! I'm very thankful. Keep up the excellent job!!!"
117940,1,These ballet shoes fit wonderfully for my 4 yr old w wide feet. However the string in front serves no purpose other than to annoy my daughter and her teacher during dance class because even double knotted it comes untied at least 5 times in 20 minutes of dancing. It was supposed to help tighten the shoes if they were big but no one in the class of fifteen seems to need it.
338026,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
105362,1,"I don't usually buy shoes/boots online, but loved this look so I took a chance. Glad I did.....great color, fit, style with quick delivery!"
383499,1,"This is my second pair, in as many years. Comfortable, nice hieght and affordable."
73918,1,"My son loves these shoes. Perfect for summer, swim class and pool. They are really comfy. Ordering another pair."
372222,1,"These are my 4th pair of chucks and I love them. I know exactly what I'm getting and I don't have to try them on. I normally wear a 8.5 in womens, but I order a 6 in mens when I buy chucks. It took almost a week from when I placed my order to receive the shipping notice, but the shoes arrived 2 days after I got the email. Just wish they got here sooner!"
319856,1,My son wanted these and we were unable to find them at the stores even online at the shoe outlets. Came quickly and will be the perfect birthday persent.
84652,1,These are great shoes. I love the extra wide front - which gives my toes room to move and breathe. I bought the brown version from Sears but have not been able to get them in black - until now.
347473,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
225394,1,"I haven't worn converse for years! I forgot how wonderful they felt and how much fun it is to wear them. I'm a stay at home mom and want to get ""dressed to shoes"" every morning in some lace up shoes. I don't really like the look of white athletic type shoes unless I'm exercising. I love my new converse shoes!"
295174,1,"I bought a pair of these years ago after just about slipping off the edge of a cliff on a winter hike. I was so impressed with their ease of use and performance that I bought this pair for my fiancee. She's just as impressed with them as I am. If you need some extra grip on an icy surface, Yaktrax will not disappoint."
48641,0,"These boots are super cute. I actually purchased them for a Halloween costume. Because I have small feet and wide calves, I thought the lace-up feature would help. It does help, however the tongue is too small so it looks weird. I think they're my best option, so I'll take them to a shoe-repair place to have a wider tongue and longer laces put on. From what I could tell, they felt fairly comfortable in the foot though."
59664,1,"the fit is good, are truly waterproof right out of the box, no break in period"
92744,1,"I think this shoe stretcher is working very good width wise. I wear a 13 wide and the shoe came as 13 W, which wasn't wide enough, but the stretcher did a good job! Never used one before! Don't think it will do length wise, that's for sure!"
280800,1,"My husband bought this for himself on Amazon (via a third party seller)and he absolutely LOVES IT. According to him, it is comfortable from the ""get go"" with no ""break-in"" period needed. In contrast, I had to wear my new tennis shoes around the house for several days to ""break"" them in ! The sole is made of Crepe rubber which is 100% natural and very durable. It has instantly become his favorite pair of shoes. Plus, it is stylish too which is an added bonus as most people would buy it just based on comfort alone. Great Shoes !"
46574,0,Buxton doesn't seem to have the quality that it used to. I do like the organizational aspect of it and the room for a cell phone. The edging where the credit cards slide in is unfinished and I don't think it will wear well.
56902,1,Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down. My 10yr old daughter also loves hers.
114158,1,"The most comfortable shoe you will ever where, especially for the price."
199702,0,"This is a very comfortable shoe. It took a little, I mean very little, getting used to but very worth it. And, not as ugly as the Earth shoes of 30 years ago. Very comfortable. Large toe box, as is obvious!"
370589,1,"I just received the boots today. If you're ordering from Shoeline through Amazon, the shipping is very fast. I ordered on the 13th and received the boots on the 17th.The boots are slightly snugger and longer than expected. I ordered a women's 6.5 wide, and while the toe box does readily accommodate my toes, there is about a half size of length extra at the toes. I expect after I break the boots in they will readily accommodate thick boot socks because of this. The leather is very thick and sturdy. I have high arches, so the boots are a bit tight over the instep, but after just putting the boots on I can tell once the leather relaxes these will be a very perfect fit shaped to my foot.There is a manufacturing error on the left boot. I find it a bit funny, because the little ""I inspected these boots"" note was in the left boot. Phillis, please get your eyes checked haha. It appears the leather at the top of the boot was cut slightly askew, and one of the nails on the bottom is not aligned very well. For the price I paid, and the fact that these were the last pair in my size at the time, I can't really complain much I guess. I am a little disappointed though."
18758,1,"I bought the bronze and 7,5 but I usually wear 7. Fits to size, and is very comfortable.I was especially pleased with the price; much less than other sites. if you need like these shoes You have to buy them, because it is definetly worth the money."
351170,1,"These truly are great boots. If you don't want zippers, these are about as easy as it gets to put on and take off with the metal ring eyelets. Very comfortable with exceptional build quality. The sizes are pretty close to what you expect. If anything, they are slightly on the generous side. Fine example of why a US made Danner is still a ""Danner"" through and through."
42911,1,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light, stylish, and comfortable."
65165,0,"I purchased a white pair of Keds tennis shoes recently. When they arrived, they looked wonderful and fit like a glove...I just loved them! After a week or so, they needed washed, so I put them in the washing machine with a load of whites and used cold water and a name brand laundry detergent. Imagine my surprise when I removed them from the washer to air dry, and discovered they were now a light blue color! Evidently the dark, royal blue foot liner 'bleeds'. It looks like I have a blue pair of Keds tennis shoes now..."
51115,1,I have purchased these exact sandals at least 4 times. A recent puppy addition who loves sandals made this a necessity. I love the cushioned footbed and black goes with everything. A favorite everyday sandal.
275705,1,"I live in northern Minnesota and these are great for winter. Warm, waterproof and good grip on the icy sidewalks. Very comfortable too. I have a very nice pair of Sorel winter boots but they are HEAVY for day to day activities. During the winter I wear the Sorels to work and then keep a pair of tennis shoes in my office to change into once I get there. No need for that any more. Driving is nicer too. Have you ever tried to drive a vehicle with giant winter boots on? Not fun."
92423,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
324531,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
381799,1,"I was a little worried about purchasing a pair of shoes without trying them on but I have been very satisfied. As a nurse I put many miles on my feet so I need a good pair of shoes. Having trouble with high arches, heel pain, and plantar fasciitis I knew I would need to add an orthotic. I purchase the powerstep pinnacle insert from amazon and removed the factory shoe insert from the sketchers and the powerstep pinnacles fit right in like a dream. Now my feet are floating on a cloud.Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles, Color:NOT APPLICABLE, FGreat shoe! Two other women I work with have the same pair."
325052,1,"It's good to have a company with experience in sports, this style will stick, it's just great for those who are demanding in soccer. I personally, are my first pair, but have met my expectations. Zuela a fantastic, durable and suitable for any soccer field. The only problem that you do not at the front where the rivets will over time tend to break away a bit, which in the winter makes it adiera land and move off. but, considering the use that I gave in almost 5 months, have responded. I have used on average 4 times per week. recommend"
226438,1,"These things are timeless. Their image is undeniable. My only complaint is that they are kind of thin and flat; if you're looking for cushy comfort shoes, they aren't for you."
343450,1,"Purchased for my 84 year old Mother since she has foot/arch problems.She loves them. She had same style but, wanted in the black leather."
286525,1,"When I First Wore it,It Felt Like It Was Weightless!It Was so comfortable that i bought a few more pairs....."
346133,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
128561,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
383492,1,This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual. I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great. They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits.
86340,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
375697,1,"Super comfortable, nice detail in perforations and bow, and can walk in them all day without any pain. It runs true to size and looks adorable with colorful skirts or your favorite jeans."
16253,1,"Trotters Women's Megan LoaferI loved these shoes. Comfortable, yet dressy with a high shine."
146878,1,"Its a bit overrated and overpriced, but uggs classic boots are super warm and cozy to wear. I do like the tall boots because of the fold down looks that you can get out of one boot. Problem is that the sole support is not that great. For the amount of money, I expect to be able to walk in these boots as if they were sneakers. I am a size 7.5, but a 7 fit me perfectly."
267741,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
126798,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
208703,1,These are the perfect school shoes for my 8 year-old daughter. She wears them on the weekends as well. The soles are very soft and flexible. True to size and very cute.
198599,1,"I always liked Converse and they are the same, great shoe they have always been. If you haven't ever had a pair, get some! They are very basic, no lumpy arch supports that drive me crazy, and they come in every color you can think of. In my opinion, they are pretty fashionable. :) Enjoy!"
32219,0,".... if they'd fit.Unfortunately I was very disappointed when my shoes arrived. I love any type of open-backed shoe and thought these would be good to have for my upcoming trip to Las Vegas. As anyone who'd been to Vegas knows, good walking shoes are a must given the amount of walking that can take place during your stay!Most all shoes in a size 10M fit me just fine, but I found these Skechers to be way too small. I was going to pass them on to my daughter who also has been blessed with her Mom's ol' size 10's, but they didn't fit her either. I don't know if it was a case of mis-sizing or if Skechers just run small, but there was no way I was going to be doing any walking in these shoes.So, a word to the wise, if they're available, buy a size larger to be sure you get a comfortable fit."
324696,1,"These are some sweet shoes. I used to have some Nike Ronaldo cleats that had the blade style spikes but I lost those 4 years ago. Since then I have had some cheap Addidas cleats but always wanted my spikes back, as well as a higher quality cleat. I saw these Leggera's at an amazing closeout price and decided to give them a try. They are full Kangaroo Leather with the Rotax style cleat pattern and the engage removable insole. One thing to be weary of when buying them is that not all of them have the Axeler soles. You can instantly tell if they do by looking at the bottom of the shoe, you will see a wire going back and forth. Some people have advertised that their Leggera has the Axeler system but they actually don't.It is a very classic cleat with no goofy technology pumped into it so if you are looking for the latest styles, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a quality cleat that will get the job done without screaming, ""Look at me"", than this a cleat for you. So far it offers a very supple feel on the ball and it feels like I get more power out of it. The traction is excellent and it is a great feeling shoe. The one thing to watch out for is the sizing on it. My advice would be to go with the European sizing as I find that to be more accurate between brands. The 42 (8 US) that I bought fits just a tad looser than my Addidas 41 2/3 (8 US) but the 8 Umbro Owen 10's I tried on at a store were SUPER tight because they were listed as a 41 (8 US). Finally, the Leggera's come in Black with white, Silver with Ferrari Red, and Pearl White, the latter which I bought. I have always wanted white shoes and I must say that they make me feel faster:) Overall these are great cleats and they feel like they will last me a long time.Update: I have used these shoes for 5 pickup games so far and I love them even more. At first they gave me a blister on the back of the heel just above the protruding bone but now that they are broken in they no longer do that. Keeping them clean is as easy as keeping some Kiwi cream in your bag and wiping some on after each game. Get them while you can!"
95469,1,"Not much to add here. Birkenstock makes the best sandals, period. This one is no different. I got it at a good price. More than that this sinful world cannot provide ....."
45859,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
74889,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
273558,1,My wife tells me that these Teva flip flops are the most comfortable summer fip flop she has ever owned. She loves them and has bought several different colors. Great product.
238824,1,"Great shoes for cheerleaders! They are durable, don't tear up real quick and last. This is one of the best pairs of cheer shoes from Converse that I have purchased."
65324,1,These boots are extremely comfortable and very stylish. I'm very happy with them!
184021,1,I was in between choices of the patent leather and leather black. This choice is a great combination of both..
77636,1,"I adore wedge heels and this shoe has a high enough wedge to indulge the ""Diva"" in me. they are fun, sassy, and very comfortable."
58317,2,"I bought these in both white and stone. I really like the stone, as it doesn't seem to stand out as much as the white. Also, it's a nice change from white all the time. My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine, so I ordered a pair for her as well.We've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s. They are not as comfortable. The arch can be ""bumpy"" or nonexistent, and they run a little small. I wear a size 8, and the stone pair are tight on me. Tighter than the white for some reason. I'm sure they will get better as they break in, but I've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight. My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them. That never happened to me with Keds. And I have narrow feet. Someone with a wider foot couldn't wear these comfortably, at all. The sneakers also don't last as long as they used to. I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school, and one pair would last me a long time. Now, I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear, and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable. They don't feel as cushiony as they used to, even when brand new. Very different. Wearable, and I like them, but they are not as good as they used to be. I suspect they were not made in China a decade+ ago. I think they are made smaller than they used to be, because even looking at my feet while wearing them, I noticed they make my feet look smaller. I like that, but, not at the expense of comfort. I might try an 8 1/2 next time. The white fit better for some reason, not so small.Update: I wanted to add what happened in my experience with the stone colored sneakers. I am downgrading this review from 4 stars to 2.They were very tight at first. I thought I had broken them in because they felt better. However, after wearing them several times, I noticed that my small toenails had started to turn inward a little. I have never had foot problems in my life, and I am sure that this happened to my nails from the tight Keds. I have not worn them since and will not wear them again. I will probably throw them away. I went back to wearing my old white pair on days I want to wear Keds.I'd recommend if you try them, make sure you try them on right away and if they feel at all too small, send them back."
164365,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
284109,1,"These are the only shoes my feet will wear! They are supportive, comfy and perfect for someone who has to be on their feet all day!"
296052,1,"I bought a pair of Yaktrax last winter as I had heard how good they were. I put them on a pair of boots that I wore all winter everytime I went out in the snow or ice and I could not believe how great they are. I was so afraid of falling before I got them, now I can go out and not be so afraid of falling. I just ordered my second pair from Amazon. Yaktrax are great!!! Yaktrax Walker Traction Cleats for Snow and Ice"
67291,1,I adore these boots. So well made and the calves width has plenty of room and the heel and sole are so comfortable. I am so pleased with these.
350687,0,"good looking shoe, well constructed, but size runs small, at least 1/2 size."
16787,1,I so love the kangaroo leather.They fit like gloves.My feet don't hurt even on the 1st day.Feels great touching and kicking the ball.This is my 4th pair since my high school days.These boots are the best so far.
73554,1,"This are super confortable shoes if you do not mind the 'men' look. Great with pants. Wear for 8h or longer with no pain, padding is extraordinary. The brown is beautiful."
82149,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
384607,1,"I have had these boots for about 4 months now and have been real rough on them from the start. they were a little uncomfortable while breaking them in but now they fit like a glove. I have green superfeet insoles for more arch support and couldn't ask for more. The leather is pretty scratched up on the outside but they clean up nice. I walked all through germany and italy in them and while my feet hurt like hell, it wasn't due to the boots (too much walking and standing for someone like me). I work in a mechanics shop and its taken the continual fluid spills and corrosive chemicals that I encounter every day. My girlfriend accidentally ran over them today and aside from a broken pull tab on one side they were ok. these boots have surpassed the two other pairs of doc martens I own and I expect another year or so out of them. I definitely recommend these boots to anyone looking at them.."
161208,1,So glad they make them in a size 16.. I do wish there was a larger selection to choose from but after size 13 the selections naturaly dwindle.
308100,1,These were a Christmas gift for my son in Kentucky. He is a photographer and does a lot of work with breast cancer survivors and did a photo project with the women before and after treatment. Always wears the pink sneakers so people will ask him why. His other pair was quite tatered so I was extremely happy to find a replacement.
50421,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
140931,0,"The slippers are brightly colored but do run a bit small in size. I bought a pair for my daughter and myself, we do like them."
188909,1,"This boot is fantastic. Its a updated and improved version of the 1970 Israeli commando boot. I have worn these in the desert, climbing-rapelling, even diving. New sole and foor support helps with foot fatigue and protection, drys fast without usual wet boot issues, very easy to maintain and all at a fraction of a price of most duty boots."
31272,2,"I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior. Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times. Maybe these were seconds of some type? Fakes? Not sure, but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these."
304428,1,"What is there to say about these shoes besides the fact that they're very comfortable, feel great (redundancy), and look good? Not much, I guess. What else do you say about shoes? Did I mention that these shoes feel great on the feet, as they would feel anywhere else? Seriously, buy a pair if you're into that whole wearing-shoes thing. $40 or so for a great pair of shoes, very good deal. I mean, you could do a lot worse; you could be spending any money at all on a pair of Crocs. (Whatever America did to deserve those, we sincerely apologize.) Anyway, wearing them with a pair of shorts is fine, but if you're vain when it comes to your legs or you're not quite ready to let your friends know that you too shave the fuzz from your legs, wear these Originals with a pair of trousers, khaki or gray, whatever you're feeling. The shoes are casually athletic, like white guys who say, ""Yeah, I play soccer"" but in fact have never played soccer for a recreational team and have little-to-none-at-all knowledge about the sport, but the idea sounds good. What's better than running around on green grass, sometimes getting to kick a ball, in short shorts and a jersey, giving yourself and others the impression that you're athletic? You're fooling everyone, don't worry. And after you wipe your forehead and throw your short bangs back, covered in sweat, after you trot over to the sideline, breathing hard, grab a towel, wipe yourself off, sit down in the grass and not the bleachers (on purpose, of course; athletes don't sit in seating apparatuses), take off those hopefully-filthy cleats and slip on these cool-as-hell vintage shoes. I promise they will reinforce your image as an athlete. Did I mention they feel like a foot-rub given by the most beautiful girl in the world? Please, wear these shoes with a sense of honor: be yourself, and for God's sakes, don't pop your collar."
341206,1,"I ordered the Reebok Women's ""Princess"" Aerobics Shoe in White, size 9M. It is a great classic shoe, not too sporty, not too fussy. Doesn't look like a ""kids"" sneaker. They are very comfortable and springy, with top-quality stitching. These shoes will definitely last. Shoes have a very soft terrycloth lining and a thick padded tongue. They shipped very fast and arrived 2 days ahead of schedule. And the price can't be beat! I paid $34 for them and for the same price in the store I would have gotten cheap knock-offs that would have fallen apart in months! One thing I did have a problem with is that they are a little too narrow for the base of my toes - ordering error on my part, I should have ordered a 9W. It's not too extreme, and I expect they'll break in and get more comfortable. Can't go wrong with these shoes!"
307955,1,"Most important is that the Stephanie pump is comfortable. It's true to size and still available in narrow (AA) widths. I'd like to be able to get (AAA). The colors are Black, white, taupe, Navy, and bronze."
173792,1,First let me say that i love naughty monkey shoes! nect these shoes are extremely comfortable and even with the high heel. The color is said to be green but is more or less brown with some army green accents. Thank you for another great pair of shoes.
295639,0,"These boots have a sturdy, comfortable sole with a heel that is easy to walk on and ample toe room, but beyond that, I am disappointed. The material is very thin and flimsy (don't expect the shaft to hold up like it does in the picture -- it sagged and wrinkled on my thin calves, leaving a huge gap between the shaft and my leg). In short, if you're looking for comfort, affordability, and have the calves to fill these out, they are a reasonably attractive boot. But don't expect anything beyond that. Given the thin quality of the material, I doubt these boots would last long."
214784,1,"These are great sneakers. Easy to put on, wide width and the colors keep then shoe looking clean. I would def recommend this sneaker."
29260,2,I got these boots for Christmas and had to send them back soon after putting them on. They fir very awkwardly and were too uncomfortable. It felt like there was enough padding and they were well constructed. They just felt really weird on my foot. I opulent walk easily in these boots.
156856,2,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
48060,1,"I can't add much more to all the reviews about the versatility of these shoes, but I will cover what I like best about them.First and foremost, I wear them around the house instead of bedroom slippers. We have ceramic tile floors, and in the past I have had problems with plantar fasciitis. Anyone who has suffered from this will know how painful it can be and how long it can take to heal. In order to avoid this, I have had to purchase $400 orthotic shoe inserts, which my insurance (like most insurances) did not cover. I used them in my tennis shoes, but they didn't fit well into my slippers. Also, I like to wear a sandal-type shoe in the summer most of the time. So basically I only used the orthotics about 10% of the time; a huge expense for so little use. Crocs really solved that problem. I got rid of all of my other sandals and slippers and pretty much wear these 90% of the time year round. I recently bought a pair of lined Crocs for the coldest months. Crocs have excellent arch support and also provide cushioning for every step I take. I haven't had a problem with plantar fasciitis since I started wearing them years ago.We travel a lot and spend several months of each year camping. We have a small motorhome and usually end up showering in campground bathhouses. We don't like to go into the showers with bare feet, and the Crocs are perfect for shower shoes. They're also handy to use in hotel rooms where we definitely do not like to walk around in bare feet. You don't have to pack a separate pair of slippers. These are your shoes and your slippers. I also like to wear them in the car on long trips so that I can slip them off and back on quickly and easily. And of course they are great for the beach. You can wade into the water and not worry about ruining your shoes. No other shoe is this easy to wear when traveling.Basically, what I love about Crocs is how easy and quick they are to slide on and off. I usually keep the back strap pushed up out of the way unless I'm going for a long walk and want a little extra help keeping them on. You can rinse them off with a hose or in your laundry sink, or you can throw them in the washer with a load of towels if you really want to make it easy on yourself. When they first came out, I thought they would be a fad that would come and go. After owning them for a number of years, I can't believe someone didn't come up with the idea sooner. They are no doubt here to stay."
204585,1,I received my sandals in great condition and fast. I recommend this person for future sales.
344289,1,"My cons were cheaper than getting them in the store and are my first pair. I love them they won't be my last. The people I ordered from through amazon sent me a shipping confirmation and on the confirmation it said it was a different shoe, but when I got them they were the ones I ordered from amazon so no harm done."
351874,1,"Awesome shoes, only complain is that I got a hole in each shoe by the Toe over some months, otherwise these shoes IMO are the best ones in terms of look and feel and comfort. I would not switch brand to any other as these shoes are so comfortable and very well built offering a great support."
159252,0,I liked the shoe because of it's support to my ankles but it doesn't do to much if you have flat feet.
262640,1,"What can be said about a pair of canvas tennis shoes ?They fit, the laces tie, I wear them."
324787,2,These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for. I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info. to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return. This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore.
319150,1,Now first thing is first I am not a dancer... at all but I bought theses shoes because they where cute and I wanted something nice to wear around the house. Now I saw that people where complaining about how to shoe gapes around your foot. Well you know the string that is in the front? Untie those and pull them has hard as you can and BAM it gets tighter! I got annoyed for the same reason because I thought about taking the elastic off and moving it to the gaping hole but after the string became untied I tried that trick and now they are perfect. Another thing is I would suggest to order at least a half size smaller because personally I like shoes to be a bit snug but this is my thing. Just another note if you are in a dance class then its better to take the advice of your teacher V.S a review from amazon :)
242747,0,The sizing is way off! My daughter is a 4. Ordered the 5 - too tight. Exchanged for the 6 - too loose but keeping. Would prefer to buy in a store but couldn't find.
166258,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
119820,1,Thank you so much for your prompt arrival!! These were purchased as a gift to my best mate and the godfather to my daughter as he is a bit addicted to shoes! He absolutley loved them and put them on straight away! He found that the added spare pair of red laces was an added bonus! The size was perfect and the description exactly as advertised!Thank you again for your quick service and quality product!
75392,0,"I gave these shoes three stars because they are comfortable and good for just walking around. However, I would not ever do anything that involves running or jumping in these shoes. The aharp edge on the bottoms make it difficult to land safely. I've sprained my ankles three times in these shoes playing volleyball (went up for spike, came down with the worst sprain I've ever had), basketball (sprained while trying to cut while running; foot sideways and my ankle gave), and once just walking (walking along a sidewalk, I stepped on a tiny pebble. my foot went sideways, and the edge of the bottom cause my ankle to go out instead of helping my foot go flat. minor roll, could've sprained). I'm prone to sprains, but I've never had this many issues with any shoe before. Here's hoping it doesn't happen to someone else, though I'm sure it has."
80133,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
385080,1,After trying on every pair of flip flops at a specialty shoe store I picked these as the most comfortable. Comfort is my primary consideration but they also look good too. I purchased a red pair and later a black pair on Amazon. The bottoms do not become slippery when wet nor do my feet slide around. I ditched the Teva's for these and I highly recommend them.
58222,0,"I purchased this tennis shoe for my 87 yr old mother as she wanted a pair like the ones Ked's made 25 years or more ago. The shoes arrived very fast in the mail to her, but the rubber sole much thicker, not like the ones originally made by Keds. Also, she is always a size 9.5 narrow, this is the size I ordered, but they were too short. If she kept them she would have had to have a size 10. Unfortunately, these shoes are made in China,so who knows what you are going to get. Why don't we have these shoes made in the USA where then the size would be correct?"
237515,1,I like it. They are very comfortable. I like reef sandals always since I first tried.Me gusta que este dise&ntilde;o traiga el abridor de botellas. No lo he usado a&uacute;n pero como vivo en Costa Rica espero usarlo cuando vuelva a ir a la playa :-)
96710,1,I chose this product over other slip on shoes advertised because of the aggressive sole. I live in snow country (Tahoe) and was looking for a shoe that I could slip into after removing my snow boots. The shoe still had to provide good traction for athe occasional jaunt across the parking lot in ice and snow. They fit great and give great traction. The only criticism I have of them is that they are not very waterproof. The suede upper stains very easily. I should have immediately applied some form of spray on stain guard...was concerned that it would darken the suede in a non-uniform manner.
86319,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
233381,1,Excellent quality. I just wish the whole shoe was patent instead of top and heel.
251800,1,"Big fan of Top-Siders for many years, but the Gold Cups still need a little ""breaking in"". With the Deerskin lining, they are hard to slip on a bare foot, especially under the tongue. I thought the Deerskin sole lining was coming unglued because it started to pull out stuck to my foot until I pulled the lining out to reglue and found that it is Velcroed in. All in all like the quality of materials and craftsmenship. Would defin. buy again. Terry in Solon, Ohio"
157519,1,"My son wanted either red or green Chuck Taylors which are fairly difficult to find. The shoes I bought arrived quickly, were good quality, and were priced very reasonably."
286565,1,My Husband loved these Lugz. He even liked the color. I would recommend these to family & friends. The product came in quick & was what I expected.
327628,1,"I love the look of these shoes!!!When sitting and working at my desk, all i have to do is look down and see these shoes and I get a smile on my face :) They are even prettier in person than on the screen. (I bought them in bronze)One thing that I really despise is when toes overhang sandals. I normally wear a six and sometimes a six and 1/2. ~Bought these in six and one/half. That was definitely the smart move. I would say that they run a bit on the small side. I'm having a little of the overhang (tsk! tsk!), hence the 4 and not 5 star rating. I'm going to look for those things called ""foot petals"" and see if those will help.Also I have worn mine in the house to ""break them in"". That is also a good move. The straps are very thin. They take a little getting used to.Living in Los Angeles (temperate weather) I'm expecting to wear these through the Fall. If I have any problems, I will come and change my rating. For now, GORGEOUS and loving them!"
188825,1,great product my husband works on a aircraft carrier all day and these really come in handy.
342477,1,These are the only shoes my mom can wear comfortably. Great product and good price. Have ordered other colors for her
279888,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
106060,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
184381,1,"These shoes are so comfortable to wear. I actually brought them in 3 colors. They are great for me to wear to work in the summer (except when it may rain, of course). I absolutely luv them!"
111611,1,"This particular shoe is a staple to my adidas collection. I have spent countless hrs searching for this shoe. Before the Airforce 1 there was the Forum and there will always be ""The Forum"". If anymore of these white/white/white in size 13 come available please let me know. I need to add 2 pair to my existing pair. If you work for Adidas and just happen to be reading this listen up ..... The white/white/white should be available year round and not on your mi adidas site that offers the shoe for $140 and I cant get the ENTIRE shoe in white. Thanks. Love this shoe."
353022,1,"I received the great Moccasin slippers, correct color and size, in a timely manner. They were just what I ordered and I was very pleased."
326653,1,"Love, love, love! This is my second pair. The last pair I had for approx 6 years! They are still wearable but a little thin under the balls of my feet so I decided to buy a new pair. These are the only shoes that give me the support that I need when I am pregnant."
139314,1,"These shoes were instantly comfortable. They required no breaking in process. What a great deal. I wore Mizunos before, but love these now."
64538,1,"The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black. The Black and Navy are so similar in color, I really only needed to order the black. The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival."
258499,1,The shoes are very cool. And so is the price. Fast shipping also.
38800,1,"Robeez are absolutely great! My son and daughter wear them from birth. However, the elastic on these is a bit too tight so I just replaced it with a longer one, which made the slipper a bit looser at the ankles. Another brand that I LOVE is Bobux. Same quality and they go up more sizes so your older toddlers can still enjoy the comfort of these slippers."
388111,1,"i work retail and this is the best comfort shoe ever. I am on my feet all day and have worn Merrells, Birkenstock's and Joseph Seibels and these are by far the best. I have a wide foot and a high arch and they are perfect. I bought the orange color first because I liked the color and combination of leather/suede. I wore them all summer and fall then bought the black and wore them on a tour of Australia, New Zealand. We walked every where for three weeks and my feet never hurt. They are pricey but well worth the money."
109762,1,"I own two pairs of the Softspots Tela, and wear one or the other to work practically every day of the summer. They're soft and cushiony. Could do with a bit more arch support, but I can live without that. Get this one instead of the enclosed huarache - it's not as padded. This one is great for wide widths!"
200703,1,"Hands down best shoes ever made. Yup, that's right. Comfortable, versatile, look great with everything - jeans, chinos, shorts, or a swim suit."
26790,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
84352,1,"I wear the size small with socks. I have it in a few colors now. It feels like a cloud. I actually choose it to wear at home intead of my slippers because they are more comfortable and comforting. Corrdinate them with clothes and wear matching socks and they are less conspicious. They are really great because they feel like a cloud. The soles are non skid so they feel really safe. I am not a vegan, but know that vegans struggle with non leather choices and think now the finally have something that works for them that feels good.I hear men choose black or brown to wear with Kackis. I think these are a great breakthru. If your feet hurt like mine you will love these. If you are lucky and you can wear high fashion shoes you are lucky. If you hurt this could open a world of comfort to you. Try the differnt models and styles because they fit differently. This size did not fit my mom and like I said the cayman looks similar but does not fit me.I looked on the crocs official web site and the have higher fashion ones in additon a RX line that is a medical line. I am going to try some of the dress crocs and see.Oh I reviewed some microfiber chenille socks and that is what I like to wear with my crocs. Crocs makes their own socks but they say cros all over them and I do not like logos."
253543,0,"good looking shoe, well constructed, but size runs small, at least 1/2 size."
278276,1,I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;These boots are great. Completely waterproof. They are very comfortable on my feet and fit perfectly.&#34;
103736,1,"I have these shoes in Black, Brown, Red and White. I just love them. They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I can wear them all day, even shopping, and my feet don't even hurt! It's amazing! Just last week I bought a fifth pair - I've been wearing them all summer, and I don't know what I will do when it gets cold and starts snowing - I'll have to move to Florida so I can wear them all year round! I just love them - and they are so afordable also."
140010,1,"I purchased this shoehorn for my husband. His last long shoehorn broke, and he was in dire need of one.The beauty of this shoehorn is that is is long, with a grip handle, and make my husband's experience of putting on shoes fabulous. In addition, my husband uses it anytime he needs something that is long, or to reach an item that is high, etc....It is not only the best shoehorn there is, it can be used for virtually anything!!!"
38036,1,I ordered for my son for Christmas . ...he loves them ..I didn't know the left sole was different from the right but one is for gripping and one for sliding

190520,0,"These boots are not true red. They have a bit of dark brick or maroon tinge to them. I was disappointed in the color but my daughter did not notice. They seem comfortable and sturdy, although after just a few weeks there are a few spots where the color has flaked off, but I'm not surprised because they are being worn hard and often."
171829,1,"I bought these in 8.5 as a successor to my Evolv Defy shoes, which I had in 9. The fit was very snug at first, so much so that I could only wear them for a couple boulder problems at a time. Around a month later, they've broken in to the point that I can send multiple sport routes before having to take them off.Soles are nice and stiff and I can stand on far smaller features than I could with the Defys. These also smell far better.All in all very good shoes. If you're a vegan like me, it's one of your few choices but it doesn't feel like a compromise."
157889,1,"These all black Chuck's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online. They shipped in a timely fashion. Great Kicks, good deal."

These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."

3387,1,"My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots."
364567,1,"Mono-Black Chucks are amazing utility shoes. I wear mine when:* working (with tie)* sledding* partying* hiking* gardening* attending black tie formal events (yes really)Ironically, the thing Chucks are bad for is the shoe's original intended purpose: athletics & sports."

These are the ones."

334124,1,"I just bought a pair of these off here and am VERY pleased with the whole process. Shipping was fast as expected, and the Wallabees are SO comfortable. The sole reason I bought them, was for comfort bc I live right off a college campus and have found myself needing more comfortable walking shoes. Many of my friends have these shoes and have mentioned how comfortable they are a few times, so I thought I'd try them out. After only wearing them for one evening, I have already felt how quickly they adapt to your foot and the comfort they provide. I'm looking forward to getting them worn in more so that they'll feel even better. Only question is about rain/water. Will they ruin in heavy rain? What precautions need to be taken? Thanks in advance!"

296115,1,"My sister in-law recommended this product when over for a gathering to my mother-in-law. Since she does not have internet access, I mentioned that I could get her a set if she wanted one. I did and now my mother-in-law is very happy. She has a slight inclined drivway that gets a light coating of snow and ice that makes it hazardous for her to get her mail. She now has no trouble walking out anywhere in winter and lets me know how appreciative she is of me for getting them for her. This is a great product for anyone who needs to go out in icy conditions."
74041,1,"My toddler loves these! He had a pair he outgrew and likes to wear 'shoes' around the house. They look cute, fit well and he can get them on and off himself. The only thing I don't like (which is true of all crocs) is they don't breathe well. I'll let them wear them inside as house shoes but won't allow them outdoors."
11791,1,very comfortable shoe. I have worn these for many years & have many colors. Good with casual or dressy. I was so happy I found the black again. For a long time they weren't available.

368818,1,"I bought this bag for my mother, who just loves Purple. She had one like this, but I didn't know if this would suit as well as that one did. It definitely did. I got so many thank yous . . ."
334082,1,"Really, really pleased with them, not had a pair for 8 years but now I have 2 pairs and I love them!!!"
382872,1,"I've bought this style shoe over & over for years for all day comfort. Also having osteoporois, I feel safe from falls. And appearance is important, too, of course. #1 all the way!"
288166,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
269695,1,"I had purchased this same shoe previously at a local department store. I was unable to find this shoe locally and ordered the shoe via Amazon. The shoe was delivered to my door in a couple of days and fit perfectly!! So, the moral of the story is "" if the shoe fits wear it!"""
250021,1,Way better than I though it would be. escpecially for $50. Love this shoe and I plan on buying a couple more pair in different colors.. amazon has the cheapest price i've found especially if youre with prime.
108664,1,These and another pair of Roper's I purchased are so very comfortable and I wear them to work (I'm a nurse) very styish & recommend for everyone!
324408,2,"I ordered a pair of slippers from the manufacturer, they charged my credit card, and then never sent them. When I called they said they are out of stock and they are not making that model anywhere, and insisted they didn't charge my credit card. I am left to try to get my money back by disputing it with my credit card company."
240840,0,the image has saturated colors that are stronger then the real product. the shew is nice but its not as nice as it looks in the display. i like the good deal they gave. i got the shew with a small pigmentation so i don't know if that means that theses shews are on discount because there not the highest quality but from an overall look at the show and the way it feels on my foot I'm happy and i don't have strength to deal with sending the show back for it but its a shame that they don't sort out.
367209,1,This product has performed very well for us. It dried the kids boots and gloves within two hours during the sloppy wet winter season. It dramatically decreased the nasty foot odors and my kids loved putting on warm boots before heading outside into the cold. The DryGuy worked exactly as stated. My only regret is that we did not get one sooner.
345137,1,"This is my second pair of these shoes - I literally wore out the first pair. Very tall, very pointy. As far as size, I'm an 8 and they are just a tiny bit big - my heel slips a little when I walk, but I think a 7.5 would be too small."
310154,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
45560,1,"I bought these shoes mainly because of the color,I always wanted red shoes. This the first time I have been able to find the right shade,I like dark reds. I have had New Balance before ,so I already know they are a good brand. I was surprised how good they feel when I walk. I am not in great shape,but was able to walk six miles strait though ,with no breaks."
384547,1,"For me, Clark shoes, slipons and sandals have always been a cut above the rest. This purchase is no different. The sizing is accurate, the quality of construction is great, and they are very comfortable.Once again, I recommend Clark products and the shipper was fast and friendly."
64246,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
348642,1,"This item was ordered as a gift for a relative, my nephew in Kansas. He received the item promptly and is very happy with it. Yes, we would order this item again."
260274,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
311745,1,"Love these moccasins! They are so comfortable, but I have very narrow feet and had to pull the drawstring a bit tighter to keep them on my feet."
46381,1,"These shoes have been my favorites over the years, and are light weight, yet last a long time. Delivery was normal, and I would purchase these on-line, again."
256248,1,"This is my second time purchasing this shoe for my child. He outgrew the first pair and I ordered more because the quality, style and comfort are awesome for the money. Will continue to purchase these shoes for my child as his feet continue growing."
221896,1,"These are great bedroom shoes, very comfortable, very sturdily made, soft inside with nice ribbed soles on the bottom. I like the nice dark brown color, too."
296612,0,I like soft cushioned shoes.But these are a bit hard.I like hushpuppies shoes. I tried this company this time. Not great shoes for me
208905,0,"Good shoe for nurses, aides, waitress, etc. never need to worry about laces coming untied and shoes have very professional appearance. However, I wear a AFO brace and cannot fit into these shoes. I plan on returning the shoes for Propet Tour Walker that I have worn in the past with the AFO brace."
285651,1,"Excelent!, hard to football and soft to my feet XD... great quality ass adidas always do, durable and exactly like my needs."
385563,1,"I got this shoes for my daughter who already has the regular crocs and loves them; but since I wanted the shoes lo be a little different I decided on this model. She LOVES THEM ALSO! She says not only they are very comfortable but also more dressy than the regular ones. They are easy to wash too so the kids are always looking good and modernly fashion.My only complaint as a parent is the fact that this shoes are not made in the U.S.A. but in China. I live in Mexico and shipping to my country, when an item is made in China, costs me 200% of the price."
137818,1,i love my sneakers. i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
331014,1,I ordered these boots and they came as promised. I was not satisfied with the model and had no problems sending them back. The model 3040 Justin to me is a better boot. This boot has a thin sole and a very low profile heel.
289251,1,"The merchandise arrived exactly as presented in the ad. I am very pleased with the product, and the delivery time was excellent!!"
274258,1,"Soy gu&iacute;a de turismo en Costa Rica, mi trabajo exige largas caminatas en bosque, ciudad, playas, senderos, etc. Por tener tantos meses de lluvia siempre he usado botas hi-tec impermeables y no tengo queja alguna, los &uacute;ltimos 2 pares los he tenido que cambiar porque se me gasta la suela! C&oacute;modas, ajuste perfecto, livianas, muy resistentes, y con un precio accesible!El env&iacute;o fue mejor de lo esperado.Pura vida!"
151900,0,"I have 6 pairs of Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip On's that I bought 6-7 years ago. I wear the Black with Mesh insert and the White one's the most thus now they are loooking ragged. I bought the above black shoes with a lil patent leather trim this time and also the White One's that do not have Patent leather trim. The white one's are great! The black one's (see above) squeak from the patent leather. I am not sure I am going to keep these as &#34;you can hear me coming&#34;. East Spirit shoes are the most comfortable shoes in the world. But, I hate squeaky sounding shoes. This is caused from the added patent Leather trim. May just return these."
14776,1,Nice dress shoe. Bought in brown. Hard to find a brown shoe that is dressy and conservative enough to go with a business suit and yet still adds some style to the look. This shoe satisfies that need.
85358,0,"They are really cute and I could wear them daily. However, I did not expect these shoes to hurt. The woven style, even thought, it's all leather, really hurts. Hopefully, when broken into, I'll be able to wear them for a full day."
347351,1,I bought these for my mother who has had lifelong shopping issues in regards to her feet. She said she loves these shoes and they fit wonderfully.
13726,1,"I had no familiarity with this brand, but the sale price, and my size being available made it easy to give them a try.I've been wearing them steadily for the past several weeks, and while they were originally a bit stiff feeling on the bottom, they have formed nicely around my feet and are quite comfortable.The sensation while walking on a hard smooth surface is a bit unique because of the many small ""cleats"" which make up the sole, but all in all I'm quite pleased.My only complaint is that 3 metal eyelets on the same side of one shoe have come undone. Two of them are ornamental, but one is the top eyelet for the lace and will likely start pulling at the leather amd doing some damage if I don't have it repaired by a cobbler."
93943,1,I love Saucony shoes because they seem to be the only shoes that I can wear without pain. I am a registered nurse and having bunions on both feet causes increased pain after being on my feet at work especially. I had a pair of Saucony shoes that were very comfortable but had just started to look their age. After hunting unsuccessfully for replacements I went to Amazon.com; ordered two pairs and I can't tell you how happy my feet and I are!! I would like to be a Saucony spokes-person because I LOVE these shoes; they make my work and ultimately my life better!! Thank you for making wonderful shoes; please don't stop.
70570,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
213824,1,Cute and you can walk comfortably for miles. I just bought a pair in the silvery color and I love them. Great with skirts and jeans.
356235,1,I am normally a 7 so i ordered an 8 and yes these shoes are pretty slippery but you can buy stickers that you can put at the bottom of the shoe! i love them and think they were a very good price
115165,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
115541,1,"I now have several pairs of Bonnie Lite Oxford Shoes - because when I find a shoe that is comfortableand in wide width, I purchase several at a time. I have black and brown. They are just right forwalking in big department stores and malls, as well as in my neighborhood. Comfort is importantto me, but also support and ""looks."" These shoes fill the bill for me. I hope to purchase navy andred when they are available!"
220680,1,It is rare to find a shoe thats fits like this one. They have just enough stretch to be comfortable all day. I highly recomend this shoe to anyone that needs the wide width. I plan on buying them in all colors Life Stride offers them in.
352717,1,I ordered these mocassins because they were the color I wanted. Delivery was speedy and they were exactly what I wanted for the winter. They seem sturdy and are very comfortable. I think they will last a long time. The suede cord doesn't stay tied but I think that always happens with these cords.I'd feel comfortable ordering from them again. You should too!!
311737,1,"I love most everything about these shoes. The support, the style, the quality, the color, the mid hi-top height. These have been some of the most comfortable and supportive shoes I've bought in a long time. I use them at the gym for weightlifting and running, and also at work. They also clean up nice with a damp towel, to the nice solid black color.The only negative I can say is that the sole structure is such that it will accumulate things like snow and mud if you track through them. Knowing this, I simply kick my shoes sideways to remove the snow, and just avoid mud altogether.If these same shoes are available when I need new ones, I will definitely buy them again. Good shoes and a good price."
369976,1,"I've worn the Rosalyn pump for many years. It's a great, sturdy pump that is comfortable for anyone to wear. If you are significantly overweight, this is one of the few pumps that are classic in design yet comfortable. Buy it! You'll love it!"
372468,1,"Lamentablemente, A&uacute;n no he recibido el producto que compr&eacute;. Todav&iacute;a estoy esperando respuesta del vendedor. Agradezco hacer lo APROPIADO a fin de saber &iquest;Qu&eacute; pas&oacute;?. Muchas gracias."
340720,1,"i ordered the traditional black converse just three days ago and i just got them in the mail today! they came in my mailbox, from usps, and had the slim converse box. the shoes were in perfect condition and were the correct size and color that i ordered. very great service and impecable shipping speed. i definently will buy from this seller again and i highly recommend shopping with this seller! :)"
276551,1,"the fit is good, are truly waterproof right out of the box, no break in period"
362701,1,Great purchase. The only place we could find these shoes in the right color. Fast and quick.
145083,1,"Reading the past reviews, order 2 sizes larger than your show shoe size is great advise. If you are planing to wear a heavy sock, order 3 sizes larger, no joke I ended up with size 14s. CRAZY!"
12241,1,"ordered for christmas for teen daughter, couldn't find anywhere in stores, so thanks! Appreciated the fast shipping too!"
161849,1,"The best shoes ever, but if you use coverse.com to buy your shoes prepair for the SLOWEST loading site you have ever experienced! Many times I didn't buy shoes because of the speed of their site. I have really fast internet and their site is by far the slowest of any site I use. If you have the patients you can't beat the shoes (I always use the create your own) I have created some really unique shoes."
112248,0,I really like these shoes and how they look. I just wish that they fit my feet a bit more. I order the right size for my feet but the toe separator at the front of the shoe is too far up to really fit my feet well. I find that they are constantly almost coming off making walking in them difficult.
269935,1,"These are Great shoes, I have been walking 3 1/2 mil. per day in them starting the first day out of the box!!"
111965,1,"It looks very cute. but just a little expensive. Anyway, i like puma. By the way, after book this shoes, 1$ was missing, besides 44$, I don't know why?"
235725,0,"I usually wear a 10AAA, but this shoe was too narrow for me. Maybe it would have stretched out, but I don't have the patience for that. So I had to return it."
241144,1,"Quality, classic style, comfort....you can't go wrong with a pair of Chuck Taylors. Great for weightlifting/powerlifting. Thin sole is good for dealifting."
284588,1,".I ordered these for my husband as a suprise after we looked at them one day on line.He loves to golf, but has a hard time fitting his golf shoes.So he did not see the point of getting shoes off the internet.They arrived today and he just loves them. The fit was perfect. They are light weight, made w/ good quality leather,a reinforced instep for support,and are good looking as well as being well made.In addition you get a really nice pair of sport sandals that would cost $50.00 themselves. Again very well made with good support and a front edge to protect your toes.All of this comes w/ a two sided zipped bag w/ carry handle to store or transport your shoes. I don't know how the shoes are on the course yet.He ran out to play as soon as they came! A great deal."
118404,1,We have two young daughters in ballet and they have only used Capezio Ballet shoes. They are a very good quality shoe and we havn't had any problems with any of them. The Dance studio we go to highly recommends these shoes and all the dancers there use them.
337540,1,they were a bit darker than what I expected but they were fine with me.there for a 6yr anyway..price good
23880,1,"Like my previous Reef sandals, I expected these to be comfortable from the very first step. I was a bit nervous since I'm pretty picky when it comes to flip flops. I have had bad experience with the thong digging in, and cutting between my toes. But not with these. I already walked over 6 miles in them over the last two days. Nothing but comfort! Highly recommended."
136008,1,"I am a 20-year-old female, and I was first introduced to Converse All-Star shoes in the 7th grade. Since I was a young child, I have always had trouble buying shoes due to the size of my feet. My feet are small length wise, but none of the shoes in my size are ever able to accomodate the width of my feet. I normally wear a size 7.5 in shoes, but I always have to go up to a 9 or 10 just to make up for this discrepency. Converse are the first shoes I found that are true to size, and I no longer have to go around with floppy clown feet. The shoes are unisex, comfortable for extended wear, and, though they get dirty very easily, a quick wash on the delicate setting in the washer will make them like new again. I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of these shoes like most new shoes require, so my Converse collection will likely continue to grow. I now own a pair in black, monochrome black, navy, pink, purple, and green. As soon as they wear out (which takes awhile--I am currently wearing a black pair that I bought in 2005 and wear several times a week), I will be sure to invest in more."
177435,1,Great value for the money and very stylish!
283240,1,"Read the reviews and had high expectations which were met! I am addicted to these and wear them 99% of the time I am at home. In fact, I was so addicted that I didn't put them in the washer for a long time, just because I couldn't stand the thought of giving them up for a few hours to launder. But once I did wash/air dry them they turned out great. Didn't have many color choices for a low price, so got the lime green...but think they're fine in any color.They do leave a slight indentation mark on the top of my foot but I don't care. I literally cannot wait to put them on every morning when I get up out of bed and then again when I get home from work."
68704,1,"I ordered these boots and they arrived on time and look great. I found that they fit on the small side, so you should probably order the next size up from what you'd normally purchase. I didn't know this. I wear size 12EEE and should have ordered 13M. However, after wearing the 12EEE's a few times they have stretched a bit and are more comfortable, though after being in them for ten hours my feet still feel sore. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a wonderfully crafted, stylish dress boot."
185939,1,I've been a runner for about 15 years now and I've tried just about every brand of running shoe there is. The Asics Gel Nimbus is my absolute most favorite of them all!!! They have amazing cushion and bounce. I will NEVER buy another shoe again.
86706,1,"I love my Converse Chucks! glad a picked grey, goes with alot of stuff. I usually wear a 9 or 8& half n my chucks fit fine :) happy with my purchase!"
184454,1,"Danner boots are the best there is period. Worth full price, but got a great deal from Amazon. I have never seen a better sale than what Amazon had."
34525,0,"The color did not go with the outfits & the fit was not narrow enough. I really wanted just the camel color without the croc look, made the shoes look cheap. Sent them back, will try again. The seller was excellent, will buy from again."
246217,1,"When I first tried these shoes on, they seemed stiff but after wearing them once, they fit great. I wear them most of the time. I plan on ordering another color."
27571,1,"I've been looking high and low for a navy shoe...thought this might be it. After reading other reviews, I did get the 7-1/2. This shoe does run on the small side. I can wear a 7 or 7-1/2 and the 7 never would have fit. This shoe is very comfortable. Wish the heel did not have the brown color on the sides. That adds to the clunkiness of it, which in my opinion is its' only downside. I would have liked a bit more of a streamlined look. But if you're looking for a shoe with some funky style (especially with shorter skirts) that is comfortable, this may be it. I'll still look for a navy shoe that is a bit more ""streamlined"", but this one will work for now."
126393,1,"I LOVE THESE VANS! they look so sick and skate well, though not very durable considering the canvas.but packaging was great and was delivered sooner then expected ordered it monday and got it thurday.Great service awesome shoe"
387268,1,"Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras"
126769,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
341275,1,"i love the reebok shoes, i were them all the time, I have always wore reebok;s per my Dr order."
254005,1,"These were a perfect fit for my girl, she was excited to see them under the tree. She loves them and the were shipped very quickly."
263455,1,"Un buen par de zapatos a un buen precio, y con env&iacute;o gratis, que buen trato, solo en Amazon, Gracias!"
216624,1,"This is the classic Converse, basic black sneaker. They fit fine on my wide feet, and they have them here in half sizes and in women's sizes.They're a good price here and you can't go wrong with the black/white basic Converse sneaker. They're good for mom's, teens and kids, both male and female.The only drawback might be that they lack arch support.I would recommend this shoe to anyone except someone with really flat feet."
253393,1,"These boots are awesome. I ended up with the beeswax leather boot and it seems to go with everything I own. Like everyone else has said, sizing is bizarre. I wear an 11 in Converse and a 12 in Nike running shoes, ended up with an 11.5 in clark desert boots. At first I tried an 11 but it was way too tight.the only downside to these boots is that EVERYONE seems to own a pair. some originality is lost."
367695,1,"I don't have too much carpet to vacumn, so this is perfect for me. I tried several other kinds but I don't like the heavy weight monster vacumn at all. There is only one master bedroom upstairs, and living room down stair come with Carpet, so ez to carry it every where. I am suprised how it work, it could clean my kitchen, stairs, and even wood floor very well. The only thing I worried about is the battery life, it takes hours to recharge, but last for about an hours or so. Good enought for me though."
218976,1,"This shoe is an excellent running shoe..........It's a little tight at first but after a day or two it wonderful.....When you order your shoe order a 1/2 size larger, they do run small"
259426,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
134044,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
19626,1,"My husband has worn these several times and says they are comfortable. But!! I was surprised to find they were made in Vietnam, why can't anything be made in the US ? they were not cheap."
131306,1,These boots were pretty much what I expected. Made in China but good quality. I bought them a size over so they fit well...Good value.
352022,1,"I love these boots. I own several pair of Chippewa work boots, but this is the first pair of the logger style for me. I find the raised heel helps take some of the impact/fatigue off the rear of my feet; they feel better at the end of the day. I bought the 2E-wide version and wear with wool socks. I like just a bit of room in the forefoot so my feet can ""expand"" when the work gets tough. The Vibram sole is nice and heavy duty. I recommend a thorough lube with Obenauf goo, for weather protection. The included kiltie tongue protector is a bit short for an 8"" boot; I recommend replacing with a taller version to protect the tongue. Very well-made boots. These are a bargain compared to the ""big name"" guys (Wesco, Hoffman, etc.) If you work outdoors or do maintenance/mechanical kinds of jobs and don't need a steel toe, these are your boots."
181034,1,I just couldn't ask for a better pair of shoe than this. The fit is perfect. The leather uppers are just a jo to behold. They have remained shiny and clean the past 6 months that I have been using them. I am just hooping that French Shriner could come up with more shoe styles to choose from. Also this particular design doesn't come in saddle brown nor tan. Wish they'd make more colors of the design. Just love it!!!
177321,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
40430,1,"I discovered Reef Ginger flip flops years ago, and will not buy any other flip flop since. The arch support in these plus fabric uppers, makes them comfortable for all day walking in summer, and no irritation between toes. They do squish over time and lose their support, but they usually last a full summer season for me.These are really the best!"
338839,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
74660,1,"The shoes I purchased for my feet are confortable and realy look neat. These softspot sandal looks good with my outfit, standing and walking, and even when I sit. The service on packaging and shipping was great, the shoes came on time and was not late. Thank You!"
47238,1,"These are very comfortable sandals. The size is a bit large on me (I normally wear 7-7.5 shoes and I ordered a 7), so I would recommend rounding down if you are unsure what size to get."
16276,1,I purchased these boots in the middle of January thinking I could use them this winter because I live in Colorado and often visit the mountains. When I received them I was disappointed because they were too small but I thought I would try them anyways. After about two days they started to stretch out and now I am in love with them!
90088,2,Seems like good construction - but ridiculously oversized. I ordered one size smaller than I needed and that was still just too big. Had to return them because they weren't really wearable - what a pain.....
233576,1,"They are very comfortable. However, they have stretched some so I will putinserts into them & that should correct it. Otherwise very comfortable. If theyhave them in brown I will order."
200790,0,"This is my first Sperry product. I wear boat shoes all the time, and have had problems with them smelling bad after several weeks of use without wearing socks. A friend suggested Sperry for their strange ability to not start stinking. Sure enough, he was right. These shoes do not develop stinky foot odors. I would rate them much lower if not for that fact.The reason for the negativity is the soles suck. They are slippery when wet. For example, I slip and slide over wet metal plates that they put on streets and sidewalks that are under construction. No other shoes do that. For a shoe called a boat shoe, they aren't good in wet conditions. Other Sperrys have different soles. These are pretty smooth on the bottom, so watch out for smooth bottom Sperrys. Another bad thing about the soles is they are too thin. You feel the road, so to speak.I might try another Sperry because of their mysterious non-stinky ability, but I'll make sure there's some texture to the bottom of the sole, and that its thicker than the one on these."
384605,0,I bought these boots after reading reviews. I am not that impressed with them. I like that they are lighter than my danners and have the side zip which is a ten. These boots would be four stars if the insole was better. After wearing them for 2 ten hour shifts my feet hurt bad. There are no support provided from these boots and this is the first time the arches of my feet have hurt. I will be trying out Dr. Scholls or something to make the boots feel more comfy. I usually like 5.11 products but will not buy another boots made by them.
103133,1,"And she uses it every single week for her ballet dance classes. They are snug and slip on easily on her little foot, and she can do it all by herself... exactly what they are meant to be ..."
316894,0,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
69446,0,"The crocs are okay it's the seller that is not okay! The crocs broke second day of vacation. I wrote the seller. The seller told me they would send extra clips whioh was fine but if these broke, I would have to contact the factory. They (the seller) DO NOT stand by the products they sell. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! ELECTRIKID - not sure of the exact spelling."
132316,1,"I had to return the first pair because even though they were the size my daughter wears in a regular shoe, they were too small. I had to order a full size larger than what she wears in all her other shoes. Maybe that's how ballet shoes run? Other than that, I'm happy with the purchase. They came quickly... as did the second pair (when I asked for an exchange). They arrived in two days. The quality seems good. My daughter has worn them one time."
73732,1,"I love these shoes and so does my 2 year old. I bought these with the intention of putting jibbitz on top, but the holes are too small for them. I think I'm more bummed about than my daughter. Lol. But they are awesome shoes for her to beat around in!!!"
150792,1,This bag is all i needed in a smaller bag-beautifully made and rugged. Bagalinni makes a great bag and smartly designed
123445,1,These are the best gortex upland boots I have ever owned. They are comfortable and easy to put on. I highly recommend them.
242181,1,"Hello, I knew this Converse on ""I Robot"" movie, I was looking for it on internet and finally I found and bought them here, I received it today, I'm very happy with transaction, It has been clear and really quickly.Thanks and regards from Spain.PS: Excuse my english but I'm spanish"
118959,0,I got these shoes for my 2 y/o daughter who wears an 8 1/2. I got the large because it said it was an 8/9. It's more of a 9/10. They're really big on her. I thought she could wear them on the shores of a lake but they're too loose. We cinch them tighter so she can wear them on a stable surface for now but she'll get more use out of them when her foot grows a little bigger.
50218,1,these boots a great just gotta break them in. which will take me prolly a good week of wearing. got a good deal too. about 2 days after i placed my ordered they went up like $20!
21209,0,"After reading multiple reviews that the wide is really not wide enough, I figured I would order a wide. I generally do not have a problem with regular shoes, although some feel slightly too narrow. I measured my foot which seemed to be between an M and a C/D, so I went with the wide since apparently it was not wide enough for most people. Unfortunately, the shoe is wayy to wide for me. I am generally between an 8 and an 8.5 and I went with the 8, which fits fine length wise.I got the wheatfield leather. I am a student and I walk at least a mile a day and live a generally active life, and I needed real shoes for my weak feet and ankles! I was hoping to wear them day-today and mostly at my restaurant, which has no dress code. I have been wearing slip on vans with 0 arch support. At the end of each 7-8 hour shift, my feet and legs ache and after I sit for a while after a shift, I end up hobbling around until my feet readjust to walking. These shoes seem like they'll help with much better support. I was hoping they would look even better than they do, but they look more like old lady shoes than I anticipated (I am 22, so perhaps I define old lady differently!). The top of the shoe ends pretty far down my foot, which means if I wear skinny jeans my socks will definitely show. I suppose this means I should start wearing matching socks.But I still think its worth it to return them for an M."
319406,1,"one of the best most supportive and comfortable shoe ever. i own 3 pairs, true sizing. i am ordering 2 more pairs today before their all gone."
320986,0,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old daughter. The leather is very good however the cut is very small and therefore does not fit.
106262,1,"Im required to wear steel toe shoes 275 days a year, and these are the best feeling ones i've ever had. I run in circles all night long, and they dont hurt my feet one bit. I get an $80.00 allowance every year and these were right in my range."
384499,1,"These were for my brother who requires sturdy and supportive sneakers with velcro closures for daily use. The extra wide width was a bonus, and they're very comfortable for him. They also arrived within very quickly. We're very satisfied."
87218,1,I really like this style of sandal shoe.they are hard to find. But amazon had them.yeah
138889,1,These are classic black gym shoes. We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play. These shoes were perfect.
207777,1,These shoes are well worth the price. The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. They also look great. A+
4446,1,This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.
124901,1,"I've always liked LifeStride shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. I'll definitely buy a pair again, soon."
93850,1,"When I think Sketchers, I think of silly commercials from the '90s, not heavy duty, workman's boots; yet that's exactly what I got. I needed boots for a job I took doing heavy work outdoors and in a shop. I needed a GOOD boot, as I have troublesome feet, and I would be on them at least ten hours a day. Just to be safe I paired them withAirplus Ultra Work Insoles. Together, they were a match made in heaven and my feet were able to make it through 10 hour work days with no issue.The boots are so comfortable that I wear them outside of work. Places like shopping malls, or even to day long outings such as amusement or theme parks, because I know they will be the most comfortable.Not only are they comfortable, but they are durable. They held up at work, and are in fact waterproof. I had some terrible weather and would wear them for hours in the rain, stomping through puddles deep enough to maintain wildlife. Besides some close calls with sharp edges, the boots never wore, cracked, or tore from heavy use.I have never maintained them, cleaned them, or oiled the leather like a good owner would, and they have held up well.I imagine getting at least several more years out of them, but to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if they lasted me another decade or longer, so long as the sole doesn't wear out."
2324,1,"Bought these for my first 3 day hike in the Smokey Mts. Hiked from elevation 2000 to 6600 in 13 miles, not one blister, no issue with feet at all. I submerged one in water, completely waterproof. You cannot go wrong with these boots at any price. My partner had 185$ North Face already broke in or not new, blisters on both feet. Thank you Hi-Tec for making a hard trek a lot easier. I wore these right out of box, no break-in period. Im buying my kid some so he can go hiking with me. I cannot wait until the trail is under my feet again."
354107,1,"Got these boots for my son for Christmas, he loves them! He wear a pretty large size (15) so it is hard to shop for him. I was worried about them being waterproof, but his foot went through the ice the other day, and he just wiped them with a soft cloth and they looked fine.The price was great too!"
325401,1,I have big calves and these fit just fine on me. I would have ordered the 8.5 as they do run true to size. Comfortable to wear for hours at the club and after-hours spots and also while working the bar and serving tables. many compliments received on them. The heel takes a little getting used to since the shoe part is so sturdily made.
379525,1,"I ordered these shoes for a high school student to wear during a production. After reading the reviews, we decided to order them one full size larger that the normal shoe size. This was definitely the way to go. After hours of use there were no blisters or pain. I recommend going the full size larger."
385110,1,"Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions. It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot."
108078,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
118640,1,Second time ordering these shoes. I would order a complete size up. Perfect shoe for play and to wear with a nice outfit.
327227,1,"I have been wearing and enjoying Softspots Stephanie pumps for nearly 15 or so years now, and I absolutely LOVE them!! I buy them in black, as it matchesevery outfit, but they do offer other nice colors, as well. The basic reasons why I love these shoes so well are: 1) First and foremost, COMFORT - evenat the end of my workday, I still feel comfortable; 2) Attractiveness - clean, classic style; 3) High quality - VERY well made - these shoes can last foryears; 4) The price is affordable, as well. I can't imagine a better ladies' dress shoe."
184619,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
241537,1,"I ordered these shoes for a wedding, yeah I know, and paid the extra twenty bucks to have them shipped 2day air. They went from the East coast to the Midwest, and were five miles from my house on Friday, but UPS charges extra to deliver on Saturday. If I had known there would be an extra charge, I would have paid it, but wasn't given the option. The shoes arrived on Monday, the day after the wedding. I emailed the company to voice my displeasure, and was informed that I actually received them before I was supposed to! My advice, great shoes, great prices, just make sure you plan ahead."
172936,1,I was excited beyond belief to get these shoes they are real hard to find most stores carry the ones your uncle might wear next is the classic black ones
205281,0,"I have owned 5 pair of Mephisto shoes in one variation or another over the past 25 years and can tell you that they are very comfortable, well made and long lasting. This recent pair of Match shoes was a gift and only the second pair of new Mephistos that I have ever owned. My other 3 Mephistos have been barely used and purchased for under $50 on auction sites. For some reason, people sell their Mephistos after having just barely broken them in and they depreciate like crazy so you end up paying very little. Lucky for me because I can't figure out why anyone would spend $300+ on a pair of Mephisto shoes. There are many, many shoe brands and that are just as comfortable, long lasting and well made that cost one third of what Mephistos cost. I can't deny that they are great shoes and the styling is right in the middle of wearing sneakers and oxfords so they do fit a gap in the shoe style area but why are they $350? If it were not for the overpricing, I would rate them 5 stars but the price is just crazy for what you get. I recommend them but certainly not at normal retail price."
99321,1,I have owed more than ten pair in the last five years and I must say they are the best shoe for comfort and fix.Never had any problem wearing nor ordering.I would like to go off the board and give them SIX STARS!!!!!!
48678,1,"Sturdy enough to support your ankles, a nice height and actually easier to walk in than ones with shorter heels. I love these shoes especially because they don't wear out easily. The only downside is that when you unzip them to take them off, the laces come undone because there are hooks that the laces loop around instead of holes they thread through."
47539,1,These are great shoes. I bought them for a beach wedding and they were really comfortable once they broke in. It took a couple days to wear them in. Id definitely buy them again.
129894,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
212718,1,"Best sandal I have ever purchased! I have every color, but still keep on buying them, mostly in black. Always want to have a pair or 2 that looks brand new. Thay are SO comfortable, especially if you have foot or leg problems. I am 63 and have been buying these for at least the last 8 years. I do have foot problems and sometimes they are the only shoe that I can wear. I am in love with these sandals. The metallic ones are good if you want something a little dressy. Again, so comfortable, well made and they last a long time!"
194126,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
125760,1,"These shoes are comfortable for getting around. Since it is a mans shoes I normally order down one size. There were no tens so I ordered the 10.5. The shoe fit fine, the 10 would not have given me the same comfort. I would recommend this as a walking shoe."
310562,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
268050,2,"the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time. I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days. It took over a week and they were the wrong color. The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping, and when i returned the shoes, they refused to give me a credit, claiming they never got them. UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store!!! This company is horrible, I would never order from them again. The seller was Shoes Central. Don't order from them, they are awful. I would give them zero stars but that is not an option"
319960,0,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old daughter. The leather is very good however the cut is very small and therefore does not fit.
184182,1,"i love these shoes! i wear them everyday and they lasted me about six months. they go with most outfits and are really comfortable. i had to stop wearing them when the sole and the shoe part started to seperate, but i'm pretty hard on shoes and these lasted much longer than my toms did. i would absolutely recommend them to everyone. buy them!"
121407,1,"im glad with this product, i know them from before and was a good price."
337691,1,I have had the chucks for about a month now and there holding up well. I like the look of them there comfortable and simple ill be wearing them for a long time! :) If you are thinking of buying some chuck T's i would there pretty cheap and they can withstand some wear amd tear! Five stars
98555,0,"They look okay, but they're not very comfortable considering that they're Naturalizer."
224148,1,I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them. They were a very good price and I will probably buy more.
86801,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
61044,1,I have been wearing altitudes for years now and i wouldn't buy another brand/type. These have been on my feet all over the world in all types of weather conditions. I wear the soles out well before anything else wears out. High Quality and highly recommended
145853,0,"I have worn these boots several times and seem to meet the advertisedstandards. I have not worn them in colder weather. The only negatives arethe strong rubber smell and not having the choice of a wider boot. ( UPDATE) I have used these bootsand am satisfied, they kept my feet dry and are fairly comfortable. They do notkeep your feet warm for more that an hour at temps below 35 deg. Footwarmers or covers are a must. The smell has dissipated."
95381,1,"I've been wearing Birkenstocks for over 20 years - in fact I just finally wore out my first pair. It had been so long since I'd bought them that new styles and looks have been added to the line. I spent time surfing to many of the Birkenstock sites, read lots of reviews and even tried some of the newer styles my friends bought. In the end I bought the Arizona style again as its just the most comfortable for me. It takes a week or two for the soles to mold to your feet so they feel a little funny at first, but within two weeks they feel like part of you. All pros and no cons for me. These are the shoes I wear when I don't have to dress up. Easy on, easy off, easy to adjust and tough!"
245569,1,These shoes really kick butt. I've been wearing them for two years straight and they feel more comfortable with every month that passes. Most importantly they are so durable!
140160,1,"These are the most comfortable pair of shoes! My first pair lasted 10 years and looked as good as new at the end of the decade. The glue came apart when i wore them in the rain too often.Keep making these, Easy Spirit. I think i'll buy another pair in white (even if i don't really need them!)"
136896,1,"I have always loved chucks, they are a classic. If you need more support in the arch, you can always add an arch support or insert. For me, they run true to size. A half size smaller is to narrow, since they run narrow in the toe anyway. I have wide feet, so if your feet are narrow, maybe this would not apply to you."
12605,1,Paid prioty post for this as had no choice . It cost $50. Double the price of the shoes. The shoes above I paid for the slower postage. It cost $19 for the three pairs. Was told they would arrive in about 3 weeks. The boots in 3 to 4 days. The boots arrived as said and three other pairs arrived the very Next Day!!!!! Felt totally ripped off in regards to the boots!!!!!'
105348,1,I bought these boots because finding white cowboy boots for my wedding has not been easy. I love the look. I think they are pretty comfortable. Durango has a shoe sizing print off where u can measure what size boot u need. It said I needed a 6.5. I would've given these boots a 5 BUT they are DEFINITELY too big for my feet. I'd say not just but 1/2 size but a full size off. I'm going to buy inserts for the heel and padding for the bottom hopefully this will make them fit better. From what I can tell they feel pretty comfortable tho. I thought this was a medium width toe style but it looks more like the pointed toe style to me and people with wide feet like me may want to get a slightly bigger boot anyways so your toes aren't crammed at the tip. Over all the boot looks nice just wish they fit better. They don't have my size in white for me to exchange the boots.-I normally wear boots but I have Double H and Ariat boots so this was my first pair of Durango boots. In both other brands i wear 6.5 comfortably.Hope this was helpful.
39429,1,"my girlfrind love this sandals , they are very good looking , confortable and easy to clean"
50012,1,"I recieved the shoes in a timely fashion. Very cute shoes! The fit is great, I really like the style. They are a bit to shiney of a metalic for my taste, I may try to dull them up up a little. Black may have been a safer color choice. I did notice after wearing them that they are a little slick to walk in on some surfaces. I am still considering ordering them in black."
130233,1,I really like these shoes. They seem like they will hold up for a long time and look and feel great. I don't skate that often but they seem like they would work really good for skating as well.
173071,1,My daughter-in-law wears hers constantly (she is a stay at home Mom)and thinks they are especially comfortable. This is the third pair I have given her over the years
82023,1,I love these shoes! This is the 2nd time I have purchased these. I have them in both silver and gold and they are very comfortable and stylish. I am a teacher so I am on my feet all day and these are some of my favorite shoes. You can't go wrong with these!
12028,1,"My grandson is thrilled with his new shoes. A size 16 looks like a boat, but he says they are very comfortable. Good choice."
119643,1,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
123010,0,"These shoes look great, but as far as comfort...I can only give them a three-star rating. They absolutely provide NO arch support. However, they are wide enough for my very wide feet."
271592,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
346352,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
171766,0,These shoes hurt a little when first worn but after the first couple times they were much more comfortable.
76053,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
200437,1,"My husband was so pleased with this shoe...the fit, the look and the color was as described. He could not believe I ordered it on the internet!"
283176,1,"I am in love with these shoes! Great purchase, true to size. Got the pink and the white and I love them both."
352655,1,"I've owned these Minnetonka slippers for well over 10 years. The hard sole is a little worn out, and the knots came out of the leather ties and have to be re-tied with glue now and then, but I would buy them again in a minute. I recommend trying them on with socks at a country fair to be sure you get the right size. I wear them every day of my life for at least 3 - 4 hours minimum. I run around the house, down to the basement to do the laundry, out quick to get the mail, etc. They are comfortable as can be and wear like iron. Highly recommended. No other brand compares."
10355,0,I found that the size is not the same in all models because my doughter have anothers from tha same brand and thisa one dosn't correspond whit the size
328075,1,"Price of these shoes is really good when compared to Keen and Teva,and they are very comfortable, but like many other Sketchers you will a bit too much plastic on it. At the times it feels you are wearing a truly plastic shoes unlike with Keen or Teva where good build materials do notleave the same feel. I am still recommending shoes and I would/may buy another pair. I have black and I may get dark green/safari."
152379,1,I was looking for some sandals there were water proof. I've owned a bunch of other leather Rainbow sandals but find they don't do well when they get even a little wet. These sandals hit the spot for just in time for my beach vacation. They are pretty comfortable but not as nice as the leathers. I found they dried quickly and were not at all slippery on possibly slippery surfaces. I don't remember seeing on any of the tags if these had a lifetime warranty like the leather versions.
252910,1,"The boots arrived earlier than I thought they would, which caught me by surprise. The boots fit perfectly fine on me. And its a nice pair of boots overall.Everyone should buy a pair of clarks."
351468,0,"I normally wear a 6 1/2, but these shoes feel like a size 7 or even a 7 1/2. Other than the size difference, these shoes seem pretty comfortable."
345285,1,MY GRANDSON ORDERED THESE FOR HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. THEY WERE THE PERFECT FIT AND VERY COMFORTABLE FOR HIM.
29141,1,"I got a pair in white and tan, and theyre both too small for me!! theyre adorable and look soo comfy, but they dont fit! I usually wear an 8.5 in womens so i got both of these in a 6.5 in mens..and i cant even get my foot into them! Im going to exchange them for a 7.5...hopefully thatll work!"
214659,1,I love this shoe except in pools the color fades after one time. The quality is still great but use in natural water not pools. Would be 5 stars if the pool did not damage the color
221477,1,"Was searching different sites for good warm weather boots, and found these to be the best price, all real materials and exatly what i wanted. Definately worth it."
308323,1,Great pair of shoes with a lot of history. the only crappy thing is that i lost them... :Cthe shipping was quick and with a low price and yes... they were not avaliable for super saver shipping...Highly recommend them for everyone
226915,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
310114,1,"buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ning&uacute;n problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva"
45323,1,"The all white shoes are cool and all, but the red and white ones are sweet. They look and play great. They don't slip on an indoor or outdooe court. These are the best looking and best playing shoes you can get for $85. You should buy two pairs; one for playing and one for just walking around."
100854,0,"These shoes were good for the price, however I like the ABT brand at Payless better. They are a darker pink which is a plus for a 5 year old and they have a snugger fit. My daughter doesn't have a narrow foot so I ordered the medium width. They were still too wide for her feet and using the draw strings only helped a little. I returned these shoes. If you can get the right size (without being able to try them on first) and the lighter color is ok for you, these would be great, especially for well under $20."
226883,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
8540,1,"I bought four pair of these in different colors. They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies! ;-) I have long, narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well. I am absolutely delighted with them."
125498,1,"This is a good shoe, looks stylish and is well-comfortable. There are some reviews questioning its level of comfort, but i didn't find any issues in 3 months of use. The shoes are a bit high,s o maybe that could be problem depending on your feet structure. As for the care, I plan to use the neutral color polish and won't use either tan or black color on them, as it will ruin the brown-black design."
231490,1,"This product is fantastic. I get compliments on them all the time. Everyone who tries them on wants a pair. Teva should pay me for advertising their product, because so many people want them after I let them try a pair on."
319647,1,"Nothing like putting your feet in to a pair of hush puppies, you have to try them on to experience the comfort from day 1 no breaking in required"
162409,1,"I've never seen such a great selection of Chuck Taylor High Tops. I think this is my 5th pair. They have such great designs, nothing you would ever find in a department store. The shipping is always fast and my order has always been correct. I highly recommend this vendor!"
268108,1,"Dansko makes so many shoes that are wonderfully cushioned and supportive. I'm a short, relatively young, female algebra teacher of (mostly male, inner city) special ed. students. I have Fibromyalgia, but I need to remain standing while teaching in order to keep some kind of Presence in the room. These shoes keep me standing tall all day and supported, but I have to be careful when walking (especially on stairs). I'm not as steady on my feet or have as strong, firm ankles, as most adults and I've nearly injured myself (or actually injured myself) many times if it's too early in the morning or I've pushed myself too hard. But if you buy the right size, your foot won't slip out with each step, as happens in many clogs, and you get TRUE support (unlike those overly-cushioned clog-shaped monstrosities that are somehow currently in style). I love them, but I have to be careful that I don't wear them every day."
4438,1,these boots seem to be made well and they are fairly comfortable. The Hi-Tec boots have decent reviews and with a size 16 my options were limited.
6354,0,I purchased these trail shoes to hike part of the Grand Canyon. While breaking them in I noticed they are quite heavy. It took a while to get use to and I ended up wearing them on long hikes. They are very durable. Worth the price especially for short hikes.
300716,1,I wear a 6.5 in kids and that's what i ordered. They seemed a little big when i first tried them on but theyre fine. I love my boots! great purchase! and they came fast!
388236,1,"I have been ordering and wearing these shoes as casual work shoes for 10 years. They are well made, a good price and the thing I like the most about them is how many different sizes/widths are available. Once you find the size you need you can depend on always getting a shoe that will fit."
339295,1,"We bought these for my daughter to start school. They are classic, cool and don't cost a fortune. The conversion from men's to women's sizes was accurate. They hold up much better than knock-offs of the same style. Also Amazon makes things so easy, my mother wanted to get my daughter something to start school & didn't have time to shop. I went to my daughter's wish list & because I have shopped Amazon for my mother before I had all her information. I was done in 3 minutes."
209086,1,"I bought these for my son. He is somewhat difficult to fit and to actually find shoes he likes. Well, he had tried a similar pair on elsewhere, so we decided to try these. He absolutely loves them and wears them every day."
318196,1,I had been searching for two years for a mid high work out shoe. This is my favorite shoe ever - it fits perfectly and I feel like I'm walking on air. K-Swiss is a great brand and the seller was awesome with delivery and packaging!
210315,1,it wears well for Nine West. I think that it runs a bit small becase I wear a 9 but can't put it on in the morning. I wish that I had purchased a 9.5 but it's a beauty indeed.
61965,1,"I have owned over 8 pairs of these boots.They are well made,comfortable to wear as soon as they are taken out of the box and waterproof.They fit true to size.I highly recommend them to anyone that wants a great boot at a great value."
205515,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
15580,1,"I have never purchased shoes before from an internet site and was worriedwhether something very personal like shoes could be purchased confidentlywith no regrets. The sizing chart for selecting shoe size was not onlyno help but caused me to purchase a shoe that was 1/2 a size too large.My recommendation to anyone purchasing this brand of shoe was to usedtheir current shoe size as a start.For the shoes themselves, I was pleasently surprised by the quality andmaterial used even though they were made in China. I wore out myprevious shoes usually within 12-14 months of normal walking to and fromschool and some work in the garden. I wanted something better than the$50-$75 dollar shoes that you buy in the local department stores andhearing good things about the Red Wing products, I went to their localoutlet and viewed their product. I went away impressed BUT didn't wantto start out by buying a $125-$175 pair of shoes and finding out that itwas a poor choice. Then I found these were on sale and had a limitedwarrenty of 6-months (American made shoes have a 1 year warrenty) andtook the gamble.After 3 months, the boots are still going strong and broken in after 2days of wearing. They are heavy because of the steel toe caps and soleplates but I have got used to them. The rope-like laces are stiff andrequire double knotting to keep them from loosening. The only thingthat kept the product from having a 5-star rating was the fact that oneof the lacing loops tore loose from the shoe upper after only 2 days."
79631,1,"I bought this pair of converse for my daughter, and she loves them. They are so comfortable to wear and great quality as well."
328470,1,"Good traction, and you can feel where your foot is in relation to the ground. The laces are secure and don't flop around.Very good product."
89600,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
85660,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
185370,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
350476,1,"Love how easy it was to order, unfortunately I ordered the wrong size twice but had no problem returning purchases for credit."
189411,0,"I really liked these shoes but had to return them because when I stood my foot slid foward and they were to small. I would recommend buying them one size up. When I bought my first pair of crocs thats what the sales guy told me, but then everybody made fun of my shoes being to big so thats why I got my size this time and look! they didn't fit! Just something to think about. Anyone who likes crocs will like these."
6280,1,"One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own. The price at the time I purchased them was just unbeatable, you can't get them for that price anywhere else."
77289,1,"Below are a few tips for you and your family on whatI have found with crocs:-For large feet people like me (size 15), do not buy the XXL size. It will not fit. Actually, I had to buy the size 15-17 for my foot to fit. Also, only the Beach sandal comes in bigger sizes, so do not waste your time looking. Hopefully, all Crocs will be made in all sizes in the future.-Do not walk long distances in your crocs or blisters will be your best friend. Some people walk all around Disney World and are fine, but many others find out that they made a huge mistake. If you plan on wearing your crocs for walking, try socks. Socks will at least make your foot comfortable and it will take a long walk before you feel the pain. My wife and I made the mistake of walking around Washington D.C. with crocs on. That was a bad time.-Great for the TSA at the airport! Slip off and back on after you have been checked.-If your Crocs get wet while walking into a building, please stomp your feet on the carpet before walking on tile. I have watched a few people take a spill or like me, make that annoying wet rubber sound throughout Target!I hope that helps!"
25280,0,They were okay and the size was fine. Just a little stiff and needed to be broken in.
269971,1,Brought these for a friend simply the best you can buy to bad Amazon doesn't offer SuperSaver Shipping on all sizes and the price range for different sizes is a bit extreme.
14450,1,This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out. I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle.
250357,1,I FINALLY GOT IT HERE IN NIGERIA. ITS MY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY SHOE. VERY NICE. I HAD TO GET IT COS MY FRIEND HAD ONE. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT
366083,1,I have a pair of these and they are my go-to shoe. They are soooo confortable and they go with any kind of jean and never fail to make a statment. I have own my pair of all black chucks for over 7 years and wear them often and they are only now starting to show wear. They are tough and confortable. I will never hesitate to buy chucks. If you don't find anything you like go to the converse site and create your own. I LOVE the ones I created there.
368413,1,"I ordered these shoes as soom as i discovered them and fell in love with them. I am absolutely ecstatic that i found these shoes! I don't know what i would do without them! They fit great-which is a difficult find for me considering i have narrow, size 11 flat feet-and they've totally got it covered. I just slip them on-and they're so comfy! I'm so happy with them that i'm thinking of buying another pair in a different color (probably pink...to match my hair...hee hee). The only complaint that i would have is that the arch is a little funny feeling, but that's it...perfect if you like the feel of low converses (y'know that low on the ground feeling) but the look of the pumas. And plus, in my opinion these look better than most pumas (none of those silly breathing holes or whatever) and the suede is que magnifique! Reccommended for anyone, especially if you're looking for something casual sporty and cute or are simply a compulsive shopper! Just Have fun with them!4.879364 out of 5 stars"
49667,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
140074,1,"Fantastic fit and feel.. negative heal-cup = comfort.found the best deal on the net, shoesontheweb.comOverstock said they price match.. but that turned out to be bunk.I've had a pair of everything Birks, keen, .. My favorite pair was from Bass (suv series). But they were discontinued. I couldn't be happier with these. It's been a few months too and they are wearing well. I use them like slippers--mostly indoors."
187243,1,"I MUST ADD THIS: I RETURNED THE BOOTS TO AMAZON AND THEY REPLACED THE BOOTS WITHOUT HESITATION, SAME COLOR AND SIZE AND JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS CAN BE...MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SO THRILLED...I LOVE AMAZON...THEY DO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. TKS. DIANE G. BROWNThis was a Christmas present last year, 2011...my Granddaughter loved them. She wore them last winter, stored them thru summer months. She started wearingl them again a few weeks ago. Walking down the road, her big toe went right thru the leather! She is the same size, 10 and has been this size for over a year. I was totally shocked to hear this. Maybe could understand the stitching coming loose, but leather? I made jokes last year, ""when she was tired of them she could pass them up to Grandma""...guess that won't be happening."
384983,1,These are the most comfortable flip flops I have ever owned. This is the 3rd pair I have purchased. They conform to your foot after you wear them a while and you do not get tired standing on your feet for long periods of time since the sole is made from the same material as a thick yoga mat. The sizing is very good. I normally wear 7.5 - 8 women's shoe. I purchased an 8 and the fit is perfect.Very well made product.
43369,1,These shoes have worked well for me for over 20 years. They are wide and the insole has a blue jell like material under the heal and ball of the foot for extra absorption. The insoles are thicker than most and comfortable. They are removable. I will sometimes take them out and put them in other shoes. The price was better by $10.00/pair than I got two years ago.They were slow in coming though. I was notified right away that my purchased was being processed and expected date but it took another week before they were actually shipped(I guess that is what you get with free shipping). I was in no hurry so it did not matter but I felt I was mislead at first by the seller.
53628,1,These are great to throw on for shopping or running errands. No complaints. They have improved the sole since the last time I purchased them.
187099,0,"I have owned Propet Walkers before and was willing to go the extra money to purchase another pair. They are good at support. My one disappointment was that they were listed as ""wides"" and they don't seem very wide at all. The tongue is thick and adds to the difficulty of getting the straps all they way across."
239785,1,"Received these shoe's prior to departing for Ruidoso, NM. Very comfortable and the STEALTH technology soles worked really well on slippery surfaces. Received the wrong color (Green vice Khaki) but I liked the color so I kept them."
443,1,Normally wouldn't buy boots from the internet but after reading all the positive reviews thought I'd give it a try. I've had the boots for about a week now. I ordered my normal shoe size-width and that turned out to be correct.The boots are very comfortable and provide very good support. I would definitely recommend them to a potential buyer. And the price from Amazon was great.
38084,1,"The thing I like most about these shoes is that they look a lot more expensive than they really are. It's a great value to get shoes that look like they cost upwards of $100 for only $40. The shoes are comfortable, and while they dirty up and scuff up easily, it's unavoidable--but it's easy to clean them up and shine them up. Very happy with my purchase."
136096,1,These shoes are a total classic. My son wanted these because they're the same ones David Tenant wears in Dr. Who. Now I need to order another pair because he wears them exclusively. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a stylish and comfortable everyday shoe.
164821,1,I love Easy Spirit walking shoes. They aren't a sneaker and don't look like one but that is what they feel like - very comfortable!
376763,1,"I'm on my feet more than 8 hours a day and these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I also suffer from a plantar fibroma and these shoes really help to relieve the pressure and discomfort from it. This is my second pair, my first lasted over a year so they hold up really well too!"
65112,1,I ordered these for my mom. She has always wore these even when she was a waitress. Both pairs she wares all the time. Shipping time was excellent!
3548,1,"I have owned 3 pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude IV's. I use them for everything, includeing work. They are very lite, comfortable and very durable. These are the best boots(hikers)that i have ever owned. You won't be dissapointed."
143234,1,"absolutely the best thongs around and the price averaging $20, they are a bargain. I get a new pair every year and wear them almost every day, super comfy, don't slip off, and leave very cool tan lines! Buy them, you won't regret it!"
68280,1,"This shoe is what i have been looking for throughout.It offers cushioning, support but besides that is also is a very direct shoe, very effective for training fatsre tempo's.The only thing i didn't know is that this model needs to be bought a whole size bigger than what i normally wear. But knowing that, i can recommend this shoe to any ambitious runner..."
36418,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
210473,1,"I am on my tenth pair of Enzo's. They are always in style, available in several colors, comfortable and most important to me............they come in my small size! My shoes were shipped promptly and packaged well. Very happy with entire transaction."
240731,0,I was upset when I got these shoes because I needed them to go on vacation and did not have time to order another pair. These shoes run a size small. I wear a size 10 and my heel was hanging off the end about a half in and they were too narrow.
188278,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
374196,1,Bought these for my son.. Paid about $10.. They are awesome for him a good deal from Amazon
247361,1,"These particular shoes are totally all-out comfortable and they are smart looking, even with air vents to keep your foot cooled down. I love them and own 3 pair!!! I highly reccommend them."
251505,1,"Love the boots, fit perfect. Brand new in the box with all the paper and wrapping from the factory. Shipping was fast and the price was even better! Wear them all the time!"
349732,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
371875,1,The Amazon picture me to believe that I was choosing a fresh pair of white/black men's 574 but the [...] site somehow translated my zealous choice into a short nightmare. How about getting that IT team and product management to sync so that the pic I click on at Amazon to checkout actually is what I receive from [...]. The white/black/and RED pair I received today was listed under white/black description and I would like to know whether or not this is a common practice or can I count on you guys to get what I see in the pictures from now on? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015QXDJS/ref=ox_ya_oh_product

293893,0,"This shoe is very cute, sporty and stylish. I would have given it 5 stars except that I ordered (and it's labeled) size 5.5US, but it is more like a size 7 or 8. I keep them because my son will one day be able to fit them, but it was a little frustrating because I needed something for now. So I had to find him a different shoe."
278149,1,My husband has loved these boots for years and I was happy to find them still available - he enjoyed receiving 2 pairs for Christmas.
315347,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
239403,1,"Third pair of this style Noat. Black Patent, Red Patent and now this skintone, snake texture. Love them. Very comfortable. Nice casual but not tooo earthy-looking."
197153,1,"These shoes are amazing!! They are sturdy, well made and comfortable. Easy to slip on when in a hurry to go someplace quickly. I only wish they had more colors to chose from."
239109,1,"I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it."
214567,0,"I bought these boots for a month of field research in Barrow, Alaska (high in the Arctic). They were definitely on the roomy side, but that was a plus since it meant I could wear two pairs of warm socks. Other users have complained about poor ankle support, but I didn't have a problem with that, and I was hauling coolers full of ice cores around and digging in the snow! Yet others have bemoaned their clunky appearance. To these folks, I say, ""Honestly, did you anticipate going out for a night on the town in these boots? They're for keeping your feet warm and dry, not for dancing!""My main complaint with the Caribou is that the ""rated to -40'F"" claim is absolutely bogus. For my research, I was out on the ice and in the snow for much of the day at temperatures between 0-30'F, and the only way I could prevent my toes from quickly going numb was to cram a handwarmer in the toe of each boot! It wasn't the most comfortable solution, but it was better than the alternative. The liners also have a tendency to come out when you take the boot off--not the end of the world, but still annoying.I'd recommend these boots if you need something to keep your feet dry and relatively warm in the snow, but only if you'll be wearing them for an hour or so at a time."
147272,1,I have wanted these boots forever! I am ready for warm feet! I did not order a size down mainly because they didn't go below a size 5! They fit great! I have a very high arch and tend to have problems with boots! Not these boots!!
330078,1,"Thanks for the package! They're delivered and....awesome!!! No special comments about this purchase! All is alright! My english is bad so, I won't write you a book!! Ha ve a nice day!! :D"
261547,1,"I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
171257,1,These mules are dressy and comfortable! Full size and width availability makes them have high comfort potential. My 85 year old mother thinks these are the best!
65062,1,i love my sneakers. i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
33199,1,These are very comfortable shoes right out of the box. Wish I'd noticed they were suede since my present work environment is dirty & muddy. A little harder to keep clean. I like these so much I may order another pair in smooth leather finish. Was a little worried that a slip on would rub on my heel but these fit very well & haven't had that problem.
330490,0,"I usually love Adidas Originals but these shoes scuff easily. I wore them twice and they already have scuffs on the leather from minor wear. Obviously, this all depends on how you take care of your shoes, but I didn't expect them to be that sensitive."
217837,1,"I always liked Converse shoes and since i moved to the Dominican Republic, i've gone thru my share of overpriced fakes. I'm happy that i can get these online now. I like having shoes that go along with any type of clothing or colour.....any!!!!So yes, these are great and one cannot go wrong in purchasing a pair unless u get the wrong size. I will definitely buy another or others in different colours. No regrets on this purchase."
134846,2,"I bought this thong in a 13 B (medium), and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top. My toes still curl over the top, just not as much. The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe, and actually broke the skin. They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on. I am guessing, though, that that is the nature of any flip-flop. I bought these because I do not like flip-flops, and wanted something a little more classy. It certainly looks nice, but I will never buy a flip-flop again."
342993,1,I bought these on sale just to try out. I use them as a work shoe and a walking shoe. They are very comfortable and durable. They are also easy to slip on. If you get a chance buy them and try out.
374910,1,"Danner boots have been a foot saver! I have worn two other makes of boots for work. I have worn Hi-Techs and Chippewa boots while working. Those boots were heavy and quickly fell apart. Once I tried on Danner's Acadia boot, I felt as if I had removed the concrete blocks from my feet and slipped into running shoes. The Acadia's definitely cut down on fatigue. These boots are light and durable. I have flat feet and use an arch support insert. I also wear uniform boot socks. These boots provide excellent ankle support. I did try to use the boot zipper with the Acadia but couldn't use them because the boot became too loose. I might have laced them incorrectly! Also, I did buy the Acadia with steel toes but I quickly sold them after one shift of use. I did not like the way my toes felt when I walked around. I have just sent an old pair of Acadias back to Danner to be recrafted (reconditioned). I want to have two pairs - 1 pair to wear while on duty and a pair in my deployment bag. My feet are comfortable while wearing these boots. In my opinion, these boots are pricey but definitely worth every penny. The craftsmanship is top notch. I will never wear another boot if it is not a Danner Acadia."
117939,1,"Perfect little toddler ballet shoe. Made well, fits well, works for those ever rigorous toddler dance classes! I wish the ties would stay tied, but that is an issue with every dance shoe we've tried so I can't hold it against them. A great choice and a competitive price."
49808,0,The boot is attractive but the pictures make it seem as if the upper portion of the boot is more rigid but in reality it is not rigid at all. More flexible and doesn't look as good as if it was rigid.
11489,1,i just buyed it for a gift to my girlfriend...she loves this pair of Wristbands
58875,1,"shoes are very light, comfortable and good price from amazon. just the look is not as nice as otehr shoes i like , but for the use purpose, thay are great."
190271,1,"Steady-Eddie Tennis Shoe - Clean lines, white, neat. You can NEVER go wrong with this selection for a youth or an adult."
51521,1,These are the best shoes I have purchased without paying hundreds of dollars for them. Excellent for someone who has to be on their feel all day!
147242,0,They are a rip off. Too expensive for what you get. They have already started to look worn and I have not had them very long.
190524,1,This is a super little flashlight for including in your suitcase. I was very surprised at how bright it is. I will be buying more for the rest of my family!
189381,1,Extremely comfortable. Like walking on air. I have had them for a few years now and would recommend them to anyone. They have held up very well and were a great deal. You cant go wrong with these.
273673,1,"I have been climbing for the better part of a decade now, these shoes have proven to be the best after direct comparison to almost a dozen other leading shoes. They are a very aggressive downturned shoe which helps on the steeps and had great accuracy on small and imaginary feet. These are also a great shoe if you have wider feet as they form to your foot better because of their leather construction."
288555,1,The shoe is comfortable but a bit heavier than I like. Nice looking kick-around shoe.
247693,1,"These sneakers are lightweight and havewonderful cushioning. I wear them all the time,and have two pairs so I can switch between them.They are excellent walkers."
27172,1,"I bought this shoe because I used to wear them for dancing, I do not dance any more but wanted the comfort and support these shoes provide. Great cushion on the innersole."
171172,0,"I am a 54 year old woman and I bought these to wear this summer. They are extremely comfortable, but you can't walk on linoleum with them if the floor is wet--these shoes are SLIPPERY. I found this out at home in the kitchen when I was washing dishes. So I know I can't wear them anywhere if it is raining or snowing, because if I enter a store with them, it's very likely I'll slip and fall."
74123,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
347131,1,"...I've been wearing Chuck Taylor's (both in low and hi tops) for well over 30 years now. I remember when they were far, far cheaper than they are today, and the mainstay colors were much easier to find (i.e., black, gray, canvas, blue and red), but I don't intend for this to be one of those ""in my day, you could go out to dinner and movie for a nickel"" type of reviews.The bottom line - these are great, comfortable shoes. I usually wear mine as they were originally intended - for use in the gym. Specifically, these are excellent, economical shoes to wear when doing certain weight-lifting/body-building routines such as deadlifts, squats and overhead presses (among the majority of my routines). Perhaps the next best thing to doing those routines bare-footed (outside of the much more expensive Vibram Five Fingers KSO - Men's). Particularly when used only in the gym, these shoes last forever. Even when they are worn daily, out and about, they still hold up amazingly well. An absolute favorite of mine.Highly recommended."
384286,1,I absolutely love love love these boots!!! I'm a New Yorker living in Atlanta and im so used to wearing these boots so i was super excited to find them on Amazon...On top of the fast shipping they arrived before Christmas...These are my work boots and they were packaged just right... I'm very thankful...and great job Amazon!!
165827,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
31722,1,"I have ordered 4 pairs ofthese shoes, in the past 6months. They are very comfortable.I would recommend them to anyone,"
228511,1,"OMG! i've worn my converse everyday for an entire school year an the worst that happened was a few small holes that gave it a distressed look. you can just throw them in the washing machine an they come out as white as they were when you bought them. i got new ones after 1 year because the bottoms began to wear out slightly ( emphasis on slightly ). overall, best sneakers you will find anywhere!p.s. they look better when the laces are loose not extremely tight."
131906,0,"had to return these, which was a disappointment, as the Duck Head brand is a well made show. However, even ordering an extra wide shoe a half size larger than usual, they were so narrow that I had to return them."
172822,1,"These K-Swiss Classic Luxury Edition shoes are my all-time favorite athletic shoe. VERY comfortable to wear everyday. My feet never get sore wearing them, even on long days with lots of standing and walking. Very good build quality and can last a few years with care. Cut is a little narrow, so keep that in mind for those with wider feet. These K-Swiss have a timeless look that never will go out of style!"
92699,1,This shoe stretcher has really helped to relieve the pain of breaking in shoes myself.The corn and bunion inserts worked amazingly well. Sorry I did not purchase two because I can only stretch one shoe at a time.
146141,1,Love them. Very cold here today in DC. They keep my feet very warm. Great for winter weather anywhere. Like!!
336052,1,I bought these for my husband to try as I love wearing Crocs. Well...... he loves them so much I ended up buying him another pair in a different color. He constantly has them on and is now wearing them to the golf course of golf days. Once you try Crocs you are hooked.
168685,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
257686,1,"Look sharp at the gym. Kind of squeeky when wet. I throw them in the washing machine to clean them. I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift ...j.g. Staten Island, NY"
49624,1,this product is very beautiful with its double color and all my friends really appreciate.This basket is easy to take care.
338282,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
249348,1,"My daughter wanted these timberland for Christmas, she has purchase them before so I known what she wanted. These are very nice boots"
73036,0,"I bought a pair of these and got a pair for Christmas. I truly loved them, despite their clunkiness. They are really comforatble and durable. However, I started noticing that my feet were getting really rough. The same was happening to my boyfriend, who was also wearing them all the time. It took us a while to figure out the connection. We were slathering on the lotion and using a foot file every night. Suddenly we put it together. Once we stopped wearing the crocs, our feet got soft again. If you wear socks, it prevents the problem, but it looks pretty dorky. I hope they find a way to fix this problem, because I would love to buy more. But until they do I have to give them up if I ever expect a foot rub from my boyfriend, or the evil eye from the pedicurist."
343481,1,"The photo was not as the product that I received. The toe turned UP too much. The size was accurate. If it weren't for the ELF TOE, I would have loved them."
190723,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
78776,1,I received this order all the way from California to West Virginia in THREE DAYS..the shoes are great and I highly recommend this company!
264127,1,"I love this shoe because it is dressy, classy and comfortable...and a flat. I search extensively for the shoe with the proper look to wear with my suits. This shoe is it!! In addition to coming in various colors -- it comes with a patent tip/heel. And did I say comfortable? There is no traditional break-in period. The shoe just molds itself to your foot (soft leather). A must have."
23184,1,They are excellent quality. I just love them. They also match with all my daughter clothe. I will need a bigger size soon!
134523,1,I have had many Eastland shoes and this is the one I prefer if I can get it. Liked the AMazon price.
359038,1,"Living in Hawaii, I wear sandals or flip flops most of the time. Because of foot problems, I was buying/wearing expensive sandals but on a visit to my foot doctor, he told me to try Crocs --- he said they had been approved/recommended by the American Podiatry Association. I never would have tried them on my own because they look kinda ""funky"" but I tried them on the doctor's recommendation and fell in love with them. They are more comfortable than the expensive ones that I used in the past. My only complaint is that the tread on the soles wears out much more quickly than the expensive ones (costing 5 times as much) --- after the tread wears down, I still wear around the house since they have many miles left in them but are apt to make you slip on wet pavement."
338300,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
292783,1,"I love these shoes - they're classic, versatile and comfortable. They wear into the shape of your foot and become like a favorite pair of jeans - worn in all the right places, fitted to your form and reliable. I have two pairs of these and I just bought another pair for my boyfriend (who is now hooked)."
211724,1,"I have purchased this shoe in the past so I knew how they would fit and feel. When I recently went to the store to buy a new pair, they didn't have my size. So, instead of wasting gas driving all around, I went home and looked for them online. There were several websites that had this shoe in my size but Amazon had the best value - price and shipping. Also, after I made the purchase, the item was received quickly. I will buy these shoes from Amazon in the future. It's much easier and more efficient!"
312073,1,They look great and are extremely comfortable. One of the best pairs of boots I've ever owned.
242459,2,"I don't know. They look weird, the sole's soooo different from my other converse!!! Buuu"
165501,0,I increased my width to 2E to accommodate a comfortable fit but it was still too close for a comfortable fit. You may need to go one size up to get a comfortable fit. It looks quite attractive on the foot however.
216936,1,"There's not much to say about this shoe that you don't already know. These things last forever, while looking great and only getting more comfortable as their life goes on."
131681,1,"I wear these everyday and I find them very comfortable. I have had them for almost a year and they are holding up pretty well. They have a bit of a funky texture on the upper and don't take polish very well, but they are still very solid and look good."
96119,1,"These shoes never go out of style because they are classic. I ordered the black as mine were worn out. I have other colors,too.No breaking -in period or size problems,either. And the price was great!"
124831,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
13649,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
66091,1,"I bought a pair in April. They are super cute shoes, and easy to slip on and off. I get compliments on them all the time. I have totally worn them to death and I am now ordering a new pair. Well worth the money."
117296,0,"I LOVE how these work with my high arches. They are comfortable shoes. However, this is only the second season I've worn them, and both shoes have multiple cracks in the soles. Deep cracks that go all the way through and across. I'm sorry, but for the cost of these shoes, they can do better than that. I wouldn't recommend buying them to anyone, in spite of their comfort, simply because the cost isn't worth it for the quality. I don't beat my shoes up and I can't find anything I might have done that was too hard on them."
35291,1,I have been wanting these boots for a long time. They are the most comfortable boots I have ver purchased and the Bordo color is the perfect pop of color. Love love love them!
328842,1,"I actually purchased these boots last year through Amazon, in both colors.I wear high heels every day, ALL DAY and these boots made a excellent addition to my shoe wardrobe. They are not wobbly at all (just need to know how to walk in heels!) The leather is very supple, and they look expensive. The brown is a great shade. Get nothing but compliments in these boots, a great staple to your fall/winter collection."
65277,1,Wat is there to say about this boots their are doc martens the best boots and more comftorble boots you will ever wear and the price you cant beat it!!
95557,1,"I now own my second and third pair of these. They are my clear favorites. There's plenty of room in the toes, they feel good right out of the box, and wear like iron.I am disappointed that they moved manufacturing to China from Portugal like nearly everyone else.I have them on my Shopping List, but now my size is apparently no longer available. I wear a 13 and now the sizes on Amazon stop at 12."
283057,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
211400,1,"I bought this for my almost-three year old. He loves them. They are a wide enough width without being too wide. He got a kick out of putting the stickers on them. He's picky about what goes on his feet and usually hates sneakers in the summer time but he's enjoying wearing these. I guess it's because he had something to do with the ""design"". Really good buy, decent price and it""s Adidas!!!"
334571,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
59358,1,"Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints."
60403,1,Pretty comfortable from day one. I wish I would have searched the web more. Found them 20 bucks cheaper after purchasing these.
138109,1,"i have a pair of light pink keds that i've had for 10+ years. when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again, i decided to get a pair of red. buying from amazon i saved a bunch, and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals. i love them!"
131245,1,"My son wanted these for Christmas, and I couldn't believe my luck when I found them for almost half their normal price! Shipping was free and fast. My only issue was that the shoes ran so big that I had to return two pair before we found the right size. No problem though, because Amazon was awesome about sending replacements quickly. Thanks so much!"
337359,1,I'm on my feet for about 6 hours a day and love these boots. I'm on my second pair and have been very happy with both.
274815,1,"This is my second pair of Hi-Tec Altitude IV boots and I really like them, the waterproofing is great. I only wish they came in a narrow width as the medium is a little loose for my B width foot."
61990,1,"This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness."
38369,0,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
57261,1,I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more! Thrilled to pieces!
151269,1,"Nina shoes seem to be slightly smaller than normal shoes. They are very nice, but they were a bit small. Sizing should have been clearer."
78228,1,"All-Stars, Old School, Awful. Delivered in France, in times.Amazon's the only place where i can find huge shoes size.First purchase, definitly not last."
264508,1,"Came in as described, well packaged, fast shipping. I found they were a bit pricey once I saw them in person. After a few hours of wearing them, they began to hurt and rub the back of the heel. Not made for being on your feet for long periods of time. They are awefully cute though."
253722,1,"I've tried many brands of walking shoes over the years, with varying degrees of comfort and support. I wear walking shoes at least 6 days a week - so I need a pair that can last. Since I purchased a pair of Rockport last year, which I really liked, I figured that I would do the same again. After having worn the Astride for a good month, I was not disappointed. I consider Rockport to be one of the best companies when it comes to making quality shoes for a reasonable price. I would definately purchase this item again through Amazon!"
333328,1,Run True to size and buy some mole skin to cover the little nylon thread ends that are going to rub near the pull on straps
304844,1,"These are nice shiny shoes, that break in fairly well and look adequately dressy."
54713,1,"I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price. It is just as expected, great quality and reliable shoe!"
324230,1,"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the ""new"" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).So, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me. Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!So, go to the mall and try them on first before buying, for best results."
162972,1,"I have every color known to man, and am always looking for more. I teach, so I am on my feet all day; I'm comfy and happy in my Converse All Stars! I must say that in my old age (40) I prefer the lo tops over the hi tops."
105625,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
74017,1,"Caymen Crocs excellent. Delivery good. Size I ordered incorrect. My fault. A pain to send them back. Gave them to a neighbor. Will try again because I hate shopping in the high street, and my daughter wears nothing but CROCS, she hates other shoes as much as I hate shopping. DOUBLE CHECK THE SIZES."
257281,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
284034,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
260873,1,I bought this converses for my daughter with the idea of a weekend shoes. When she saw it she loved it so much she uses it for school. She loves them!
50592,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
74727,1,"I recently bought a pair of these truly amazing shoes, it is impressive looking and has a snug fit ensuring complete support. I am an athlete and this shoe is one of the best running shoes I have ever come across. I love these shoes and would really recommend them to anybody active."
115593,1,Vert comfy - but I would suggest a half size to full size larger if you are not fimilliar with such bodacious heels - they make your legs look KILLER!
6390,1,"Haven't taken them out on the trails, but thought I would say they are very true to size. I always wear a 10, but there wasn't a 10 available, so I bought a 10.5, and they are too long. I'll keep them, cause I paid nothing for them, but length is just a bit too long. Width is comfy -- maybe a thicker sock..."
192691,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
260617,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
339185,1,An Excelent choice. They are very good for everyday use. Accesible price. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
124069,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
284848,1,"This tap shoes are for my son,he wears size 6 regularly and size 8.5 is good for him.Comfortable,look good. Not leather,unfortunately."
118760,1,"There is no way to properly order ballet slippers from this site, so, taking into account the reviews I ordered large and the slippers are still way too small. Now Amazon - which offers no sizing help to begin with - charges ME $4.99 to return the stupid things!! Take your child to the store with you and buy shoes that fit. By the time you end up with properly sized shoes from Amazon you will have paid twice what the slippers are worth."
243961,1,I followed recommendations from others who reviewed this product before me and ordered one size bigger. I didn't regret my decision. Those shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Definitely well worth the money and a great purchase for someone who just started.
153053,1,Shoes were delivered quickly and in great condition. Great for summer if this is your kind of style. I bought these for my mother and she looks pretty sharp in them. Good comfort and traction.
188878,1,these are the only sneakers that do not hurt arthritic bunions...VERY highly recommend.No hard canvas or leather...nylon that comforms to feet...extremely comfortable... I wear an 8.5 shoe but size 9 in this sneaker
372797,1,My teenager loves these Chuck Taylor's and he is so happy that he received them for his Christmas present.He says they are very comfortable and they look good with his skinny jeans too!Also a great price too.
166240,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
318885,1,Have bought these shoes for the past 20 years. the minute you put them on they are very comfortable.NO BREAKING THEM IN
291451,1,Great cowgirl boots...a real hit at our Dude ranch vacation!FAST SHIP!
380921,1,"The shoes do run small so I ordered one size up based on previous reviews. My feet are wide at the toes so I stretched them overnight and now they fit and feel great. My feet hurt after 12 hr nursing shifts with special shoes, but I can square dance in these for hours and feel fine. Almost wish I could wear them to work!"
130082,2,I remember when Converse meant quality but not anymore. I purchased these for my son and in just a few months the literally fell apart the whole leather shoe came apart from the sole on both shoes. The leather is still in new condition so they were not abused in any way just poor quality.
45574,1,"I like the design, but the bottom was kind of weird. They feel kind of strange walking around in them, but I'm not sure if that's just because I have yet to break them in, or because the design inherent in the shoe is messed up. You have to do up the laces all the way up the shoe's tongue yourself."
33270,1,I brought this for my Mother. She loves the shoes. This is the only place I could get them. Her Christmas was made by receiving this product.
342222,1,"Love, love, love these boots! So incredibly comfortable - good fit - great with dress pants or jeans. Wish I had ordered multiple pairs when they were on sale!"
270839,1,"i had that pair of shoes two years ago, i stopped wearing them because they were almost destroyed!i want them again,so bad !i can't find them anywhere ! there great!please help! :)"
256476,0,"Bought a pair with the same UPC from a sports chain locally, so I got the right size. Mine were made in Mexico. Will use them primarily to wash my cars and work in the backyard. I don't know how long the strap will last. But it is in place so far, so I shouldn't complain yet. The front holes are positioned odd. The ""index"" finger is sticking out and unprotected. Why not skip this one hole or use a different pattern? Besides that, the crocs feel comfortable. They don't seem to mark floors and decks, which was my requirement. I guess they will do."
208731,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
324745,1,If you want a shoe that gives no matter how much you stand on your feet-these are for you! Comfortable-affordable and well made-best shoes for your tired feet!
201384,1,A very nice shoe & great looking. I had to return it because it wasn't narrow enough but it looked great on me & I was tempted to keep it.
201311,1,I received my shoes in time. Great product. I recommend it to anyone. I think the price was reasonable because the shoes are very well made.
186708,1,I love these shoes. This is the 5th pair i've bought over the past 3 years. They are wonderful for hiking and very quick and easy to put on. I would highly reccomend them to everyone.
266832,0,I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it.
330039,2,"I got this bag, and was very excited. All my friends loved it, and so did. BUT, I have used this bag for less than 6 months, and it is falling apart. The leather handle started to peel away, which I have glued now twice. I even went as far as taking it to a leather store, to see if they could fix it. The guy said it is only bonded leather, and it is going to continue to do what it is doing. Then said, I hope you didn't pay alot of money for the bag. I didn't reply. IT GETS BETTER, the other day, one of the metal studs by the handle fell off, and I can't find it. So I have this hole by the handle now. If I knew it was going to do this, I would have never spent the money. And I would NOT spend over $100 for it, it should be less in my opinion."
318395,1,This shoe is very comfortable and so far easy to clean. They were comfortable at the first wearing. They are excellent when you have a lot of walking to do.
261156,1,"Did exactly what I thought they would. Which is, be shoes. I am still wearing them and probably will continue to wear them for some time."
224640,1,"The way one dresses is a form of expressing our likes and interests, we express our style down to the shoe, literally. Having such a vast variety of brands to chose from, what style and price suits best to an individual can be challenging. So why not save a couple dollars on a good pair of shoes that can give you style, comfort, and suit both male and female gender? Converse foot wear is the perfect answer for all of these categories by offering everything one can ask for. What was started in 1908 by Marquis Mills Converse with Chuck Taylor joining in 1918 as a sneaker for athletic wear would become a stye trend by the 1950's. The Chuck Taylor All Star collection is the most popular collection from the converse brand with the wide range of colors it has to offer.In this tough economic time everyone is trying to get the best deal on the products they want most, no one wants to spend over one hundred dollars on a pair of shoes because we cannot afford it, or we're just trying to spend our money wisely. Converse prices range anywhere from thirty to eighty dollars depending on the style of the shoe. Some of Converse competitors are Nike and Vans both having decent shoes but at ridiculous prices both having shoes start at fifty dollars and going over a hundred dollars, which is not worth the money. Luckily All Stars can save you a couple dollars and still be stylish.Not only is the price reasonable for this product but you also get an enormous variety of colors to select from making your possibilities endless. From personal experience I have used over 10 pairs of Chuck Taylor's and have many colors and styles to chose from. This collection being my favorite, with the options of choosing either high tops or the classic low tops one cannot go wrong.The classic style of the black and white low top is simply a must have for everyones closet. These shoes are long lasting and comfortable to wear the entire day. Having worn both Vans and Nike's in the past they were no where near being as comfortable as chucks are. No one wants to walk around with blisters on there feet from having a bad pair of shoes.Converse suit a broad range of ages from infants, teenagers, to young adults and even mature adults. Both male and female foot wear run in very similar looks making it almost hard to know which shoe is male and which is female which is great. From previously being a high school student and now in college I saw that this age group gets the biggest use out of chucks since they have a simple sold look to them and in no way are uncomfortable. These shoes are for a more casual look, and fit to any persons style, so they're for every day use making it easy in the morning not having to decided what style of shoe you'll wear because you'll know exactly what pair of shoe to reach for.Having comfort, style, and a great price for a pair of shoes makes ones choices endless, and makes you want to get more than just one pair of shoes. So why wouldn't you want to go get a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse, It is the best choice you can ask for and you most defiantly wont regret buying this pair of shoes. Best way to go is to purchase a cheap pair of shoes that look great a provide the best comfort as apposed to having a good looking pair of shoes on the exterior and uncomfortable on the interior."
339026,1,"I ordered these shoes and received them in LESS than 24 hours. I had ordered them first from Trendi USA and after 5 days they had not even shipped them yet so I cancelled and bought these from GamedaySoles and received them the next day. So I would suggest always making sure it says, Order Fulfilled by Amazon.The shoes do run a little big so I should have ordered them a 1/2 size smaller but it's not enough to return them. Just keep that in mind before you order.Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Shoes (M9166) Low top in Black"
297179,1,classic shoe. Mine came in not looking like the picture which is a pleasant surprise. Mine are darker and retail for 130.00. I am not sure how I got the darker ones because I cant find them for the price i got them
388219,1,"I purchased my first pair of Matai, by Naot, shoes in early September. I had some Naot shoes years before, and remembered how comfy they were. At first I only wore them a few days a week. Then I noticed that the days I wore them my legs and hip did not hurt as much. I fell on the ice last winter, and was finally going for a dreaded cortisone shot in my hip, after many other therapies did not help.Now I don't need it. Yay!! I have been wearing these shoes exclusively for almost 2 months, and have already purchased another pair and will buy another soon. I am so afraid they will sell out and I won't know what else to wear. I cycled through all my other high quality shoes to see how my hip felt. Dansko which I used to love, too heavy and more pain. Shoes I loved in the past, like Born, just don't cut it anymore with my hip issues. I had not had hip pain before. I work on my feet for 8 hours or more a day. I was beginning to think I would have to look for another job, but now I am mostly pain free. Thanks, Naot for these wonderfully crafted shoes. Keep them coming. PS, I am ordering my 3rd pair right now. My own testimony made me realize I needed the 3rd pair to keep them fresh! Try them. You will love them."
156212,1,"I bought these so my 3 year old daughter could start dance class because I wasn't able to find any stores in my area that sold them. I was a little nervous ordering shoes without having her try them on first but I went by the size chart that was provided. According to that, I was supposed to order an 8, however they are a bit small. I would recommend going up a half size from what is suggested on the size chart. They will work in the short term but I will be ordering at least a half size up if not a full size very soon. In the mean time I used my hair dryer to soften the shoe and stretch it out a bit so her toes weren't so cramped.Other than the inaccuracy of the sizing recommendations the shoes are great."
89032,1,Allen-Edmonds always puts out quality items. This oxford style formal shoe has been discontinued so if you can find a pair spend the money and buy it.
76239,1,"I bought these to dance in: swing and cha-cha-cha. They are perfect. The height (2"" heal) is elegant without making me lose my balance. And the fit is exactly the same as my street shoe size, making ordering easy.The tan leather is supple and soft and the hard leather soles of the shoes glide easily. The soles are cross-hatched on the bottom to provide a little traction, but I would not recommend wearing these as street shoes, since you will ruin them as dance shoes. I only wear mine inside on carpet or on hardwood.If you want to use these as street shoes, you will need to take them to a cobbler as suggested by other reviewers. I think that would be a wise investment, since they are really pretty shoes that go with everything from summer skirts to party dresses, and they don't cost a fortune.My husband even thinks these shoes are pretty and feminine, which surprised me. Like most guys, he never notices my shoes! Why oh why do women waste hundreds of dollars on Choos and Blahniks anyway? These shoes are as elegant as you will ever need, are all leather, and are reasonably priced. My husband even suggested I get a pair in black!Happy dancing!"
73405,1,I had a pair size the same as my shoes (13) and did not enjoy themWhen I got this pair (14-15) I use them every day and enjoy them a lot.crocs rock!
58742,1,The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected. I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider.
90659,1,"I received many compliments when I wore these bowling shoes for a company bowling fundraiser.... they are sooo retro.Better yet, they are extremely comfortable and offer great support while bowling. No more sticking to the bowling lane with the rented shoes.I only wish I'd bought them sooner."
138647,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
238968,0,"I ordered both a sand and a black men's size 10. The sand was properly sized, the black was tiny--the sole was 3/4"" shorter than that of the sand. Return of a defective product netted another tiny black 10. It's pretty clear that they have a warehouse full of improperly labelled black size 10's, and that nobody at Amazon reviews the customer comments about an order."
168120,1,"+quick delivery, good product,-had to pay extra customs, would be nice if rates are mentionned...didn't know that..."
166859,1,"Got my boots to go hunting just a day before leaving for the trip. Hoped they would not require break-in as other reviews suggested, and indeed, they fit great on my narrow (A/B width) feet and were flexible and comfortable right out of the box. I did insert Super Feet orthotics in lieu of the provided half-orthotic. It does slightly increase the height of your foot in the boot to do so, but I like the comfort and extra arch support I get with the orthotics, and didn't cause any fit problems for me. If I had any sort of quibble with the boots, it would just be that they don't have padding at the top like the Danner's Trophy boots, but it's nothing that socks with some pad on the leg (I use snowboard socks) won't solve. So far, they've help up well in rocky and uneven terrain, and my feet weren't tired like they usually are after trudging around all day. A great investment, as I expect these pair to last me for decades (and be repairable/resole-able with the stitch-down boot) , unlike my last pair where the synthetic midsole just disintegrated after about 10 years."
386030,1,"Great buy pluss good confure, worth the money.And great look for casual dressing,they feel like walking on air.I recommend this foot ware to any one that like to feel there feet in confert. Worth the money."
228367,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
214339,1,I love these boots! They are my second pair of bearpaw and they are fantastic! My daughter has uggs and really these are softer inside. Very cozy... Very cute... Very affordable.
118214,1,We have ordered a pair of these shoes from Amazon three times before and have been happy with their durability. This time we were able to get these in a narrow fit which have been perfect for our tall yet very thin daughter. Again we feel this was a great buy.
169060,2,The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so. The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality.
344530,0,"While they look nice and are light weight, the length seems to be off between the left & right shoes. Left shoe fits nicely, but the right is cramped for my big toe, even though there is plenty of room in the toe box for the rest of my toes. Have not had a problem like this with any other shoes."
119860,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
330433,0,"Very good quality boat shoe. Superior to comparable brands.Nevertheless, the shoe's (M) could be misleading.As user of Timberland's brand, among others, Dockers is definitely Narrow."
259784,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
167981,1,Perfecto estado hasta Venezuela! Excelentes y de buena calidad recomendado al 100% ningun problema en lo absoluto! . . .
252600,1,"Crocs rock! I wear mine everyday. They are not the most attractive footwear, but I don't mind and since they are so popular, no one really judges the look, just the feel! I hope they are always available. I will wear them the rest of my life!"
47926,1,"I was always critical of crocs because, in my opinon, they are some pretty ugly footwear, but I thought I would give them a try. Being in Afghanistan and having to use public showers, you really dont want footwear that is going to fall apart on you. These things not only do the job when it comes to showering, but they are just extremely comfortable. Waking on gravel back and forth from the tent to the showers, you cant even feels the rocks under your feet. As assumed, they breathe really well and just good shoes to wear around and kick back in. The only thing is that they ran rather big and I had to send the first order back. I wear an 11.5 and a 12 was absolutely gigantic. I ordered a pair in 11 from another site later on and they were perfect. yes, they might not be the most visually appealing shoe on the planet, but they are amazingly comfortable and durable."
229293,1,"i love these shoes, they are so comfertable. and are easy to clean. I plan to buy another pair in another color!"
126668,0,"I love the look and design of this shoe. It's so stylishly retro, the ultimate sneaker. However, that's where the love ends.I've used Superfeet arch supports for years because I have very low arches and knee problems as a result. I don't typically care what kind of insoles shoes have when I'm shopping for new shoes, because I know I'll just pull them out and insert my Superfeet. However, to my dismay, the insoles in these shoes do not come out!! What shoe manufacturer makes shoes with non-removable insoles?!! Apparently Adidas. For me this is a deal-breaker, and I've returned them. Despite what I've read, these insoles have very little arch support."
166339,1,"Wow, my first review. Naturally, I would review the T-Macs first, but I just love the Reebok Amaze classics. I got the baby blue and white. If you cool ghetto and urban, defintely it's a pick up. Comfortable, stylish, good ankle support, and lasts for a long time. I just keep buying more of it."
241927,1,"I had them since I was in HS and they were one of the most comfy shoes I have had since. I am now about 3 years into college and they continue to be my favorite pair... And of course, Globe knows their stuff!Enjoy!:)"
15303,2,One of the LOWEST & CHEAPEST quality shoes I have EVER seen!!! Any positive feedback (in my opinion) must come from an employee or someone with VERY LOW standards...DO NOT BUY!!! They WILL NOT last very long!!
189586,1,"I saw these moccasins in a store in San Juan Capistrano CA but by the time I went back to get them, they did not have my size anymore, so I found them on Amazon.com. Lucky me! They are so soft, and comfortable. I like the color because it is neutral and I can wear them with anything and they will be good in warm weather."
6799,1,"If you are considering buying docksiders, the Billfish model is the one to buy. I just bought my second pair, and they are terrific. The rubber soles and heels make them very comfortable to stand or walk in, unlike the basic docksider shoe with leather bottoms. They cost a little more, but are well worth it."
115180,1,After wearing 574 for a few years I decided to try the another retro show the 420. While the show is nice looking and flexible. There is very little padding compared to the 574s I have had. I will wear the shoes till they wear out but will go back to 574s for my next shoe.
7514,1,"I like them. They are a little dorky looking but perfect for work. Very comfortable and great price, i recieved them on the earliest possible date, which was great!"
134706,1,I usually wear a 6.5 but they are a little big so I would order a half size down but other than that they're great.
181271,1,These shoes have been the traditional Xmas gift to my sail boating son-in-law for 20+ years. He will not wear any other boat shoe. The 9 wide is a perfect fit. Most other brands do not come in wide.
48326,1,"I discovered Havaianas two and half years ago, shortly before a trip to Hawaii. I bought two pairs, black and orange, at rock bottom prices thinking it was insane to pay $20 for flip-flops.Good lord, I was wrong.These are the most wearable, walkable flip-flops I've ever known. I've walked miles in these things, across hot tar even. After two years, the original two pairs hardly showed depressions in them...this is highly unusual with the cheapos.I recently ordered 7 new pairs (crazy, yes, I know), and found all of the solid colored classics fit and look just as great as the ones I first fell for."
145190,1,"Purchased UGG Classic tall for my daughter but she preferred the short version. Unfortunately Metro Shoe Warehouse did not carry the short. Upon contacting them, they forwarded all the necessary paperwork for return and refund and within a week my account was credited properly. I am very satisfied with the transaction and would purchase from them again."
84940,1,"I've not had my Keen Newport H2 sandals very long, but so far I'm really impressed with the comfort. They fit my wide, sized 13 feet very well.Yes, you can wear them hiking. I tested them out on a trail that included asphalt, boardwalk, fine gravel and rocks. The Keens did great and stayed comfortable. I realized later that I was getting a small heel blister, but I hadn't adjusted the fit on that foot quite right - and I ran an asphalt section of trail just to give them a good workout and they never felt uncomfortable.I can confirm what other reviewers have said - that when something gets stuck in them you pretty much have to take them off to get the debris out, and they are slippery on wet rocks (the main reason I give them four stars instead of five), but overall they did great.I walked through a wet spring and they dried out quickly. I haven't had them long enough to tell if there will be odor or durability issues, but so far I really like them and would consider other Keen products."
97998,1,"I bought my first pair of Crocs while recovering from neck surgery over two years ago. I was really looking for some walking shoes so I could exercise in the Mall. Well, the Crocs were on display so I tried them on. Cheap, lightweight and oh, so comfortable. I figured they would last a few months and they would get tossed but, so what? Well I've worn that original pair for all this time and I've been using them this summer for my yard work. I hose them off and leave them by the back door. They've gotten beat up and they're now pretty worn looking but they are still comfortable and still practical for a yard shoe.Of course, they're goofy-looking in all those electric colors and that funky toe shape. Not an issue for me.These things are as comfortable as Birkenstock sandals and clogs but cost considerably less. They're so cheap, I don't mind abusing them. And they take the abuse and only need a quick hosing down to be clean and ready for more abuse.Since that original pair, I've bought two more. One pair is kept by the front door and one in the RV. I just ordered two more pair from Amazon on sale. I can always justify comfortable shoes."
375173,1,"I have used these boots while hunting caribou,moose and elk. My feet were always comfortable no matter if I were in the snow on a mountian or in a bog. They were also comfortable at the fire station."
244418,1,Son states that these are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes he has ever worn - will be ordering more soon.
87883,0,I thought these shoes would be perfect for a wedding...I think I expected them to be just little flats and not like a slipper. A little dissapointed.
173975,0,"These swim shoes get on and off easily even when wet. What I did not like was that there is no &#34;grip&#34; to keep you from slipping on tiles or smooth surfaces on the pool deck. I also needed shoes that would grip so I could work out better when doing water aerobics. If you need this too, then these are not the shoes to buy.If you plan on using them on sandy beaches, then they should be fine."
229224,1,"These boot moccasins by Minnetonka are great! I've been wearing them since high school. Feels like walking around in your slippers-- there so comfortable! Unique frontier, hippie type look that goes great with denim (faded looks best) and leather--particularly in fall and spring. More guys should try them out for a unique, confortable look."
75928,2,"Nice looking shoes, but the ones I received are way too small. They say size 7.5N, but definitely are not. I will have to return them."
342586,1,"Great with jeans, great for fun and sport but mostly a universal staple in ones wardrobe man or woman! I would order them again and in every color of the rainbow. I am not thinking of the high tops and the other higher tie up ones."
236262,1,"These boot are great for my work. They are very light, needed very little time to get them to fit and conform to my feet. Just like other reviews, they are like wearing running shoes. And these do get my feet hot. Very comfortable and stylish. I have received several compliments in the two weeks I have them.Great price and value. Plus they do carry 5.11 Tactical's lifetime warranty."
121116,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
133178,1,These worked great and the price was much better than I could find elsewhere. They do run a little big which is perfect - they'll last through the entire year of dance :).
321570,1,"The plan was to order these from overseas and pick them up from a friend's house when I holidayed in America. They were very narrow, and measured against other W shoes, were distinctly ..er..unwide. I had no chance to return them and so now I have a nice pair of moccasins I can use for a present for someone else."
67864,1,Love these boots. They are comfortable and easy to wear. They look as new as when I took them out of the box on Christmas Day and I have worn them everyday since. They came to my front door the same week I ordered them. I will order again.
329424,1,"This boot is cute, comfortable and not too expensive. I'm a larger size 10 (10s don't always fit me but 10.5 can be too large) and these fit nicely. The platform wedge is a heel one can wear comfortably all day even when there's a lot of walking to be done and the soles are very light and don't stress one's knees. The floral pattern on the fabric part of the shaft makes this boot distinctive and a great casual style with pants or skirts. Roll your pant legs up, tuck in skinny pants or wear crops to show the pattern - the light color shows up well in dark clubs."
175479,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
293802,1,"I have owned 3 other pairs of these boots. I have worked outside and as a bartender. The lace up boot gives my ankles extra support in the late and long hours. and the Waterproof is a bonus. I can be standing in 2 inches of water, and my feet are nice and dry.I wear them with my work clothes or with blue jeans, and they look great. and they feel even better. Wouldn't travel or work without them."
77367,1,I love my crocs. Walking around barefoot around the house hurts my feet. I love walking on these.
193375,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
40825,1,I love the way they mold to my foot shape. They are so comfortable. The color selection is very extensive.
349977,0,"I ordered these over a week ago after a long search for inexpensive Gore-Tex boots. They are comfortable, offer no pinch spots for my medium-volume feet, and performed well on a five-mile hike in 20 degree weather.I have two gripes - one, after such a short period, I've already noticed slight separation between the leather upper and the rubberized outer sole. Secondly, my sturdy-looking laces have already begun to fray and weaken in one spot.Both of these issues are minor, though, and easily repairable. I'm pleased with their waterproof qualities so far, and found nothing comparable in their price range."
80928,0,"The item is OK, just a color is different from the image that the seller showed in the website"
363269,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
351575,1,"Estos zapatos son de lo mejor, muy deportivos y provoca tenerlos todo el dia puestos.Sirven para uso diario o para practicas de deportes. Buen dise&ntilde;o, bastante agresivo. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados."
203635,0,A size different from my order was sentand I ended up paying tge return postage. The boot looks nice but it runs small.
56913,2,"I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on, they hurt my feet. They are extremely narrow - returned right away."
344571,1,"The ""roper"" boots arrived promptly and were exactly as listed. They are well build and very comfortable as well as attractive.James Lyons"
47850,1,"My husband wanted Crocs for house and outdoor casual use. He loved the fit and ease and waterproof qualities of his Crocs, but we were were surprised when the soles wore through in 6 months. We expected longer better wear of a ""beach shoe."" But still Crocs are Crocs: we ordered another pair."
134207,1,"I never thought I would find something like this especially in time for Christmas, thank you so much- they are awesome looking and the recipient will absolutely LOVE them as a Christmas Gift. I will be a returning customer for life."
18275,1,Great shoes with a very soft heel. Had to order 1 size smaller than usual - size runs big. Received many complements on these.
383675,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I can remember wearing in a long time and they look great with flare and boot cut jeans. I am going to buy my second pair right after I write this review, I wore my first pair so much I have worn them out!"
13657,0,"I bought these as character shoes for opera performance. They are very uncomfortable for now and I cannot wear them more than an hour without swearing, but all the singers I work with tell me that once you wear them for a while, they become very comfortable..."
389532,1,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
68706,1,These are a favorite. I have three pairs. I have a small wide foot and finding 3Es is tough. This new pair is for dress and the older pair is worn enough to look good with jeans
131981,0,Nice appearance but rather small ammounts of polish. Brushes somewhat hard for shoe surface. Overall it is as depicted.
310598,1,These boots were just beautiful! I bought them as a Christmas gift for my mother and they were a hit. They were well made and very stylish. They do fit a bit narrow though - so they're in the shop being stretched. I would buy Penny Loves Kenny boots again.
340131,1,"awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy."
104248,1,I love these shoes. It takes a little break in time because they are leather. I love the ostrich and have been looking for some good looking shoes like these. I won't look any further. Thanks for such a pretty and well made shoe.
374479,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
140807,1,"I purchased a pair a couple of years ago to help strengthen my feet and recover from tendonitis. They seem to operate like those plantar fasciitis therapy devices that make you squeeze your toes to form a ""fist"" with your feet. My old sandals definitely helped! Decided to add to my Dr. Scholl's sandal wardrobe and received a new pair today. After struggling to adjust the straps like on my old pair, I realized the buckle does not slide. If you look at the side of the buckle you will see tiny screws on the side nearest the little toe. That is the hinge. Gently pry open the buckle from the side near the big toe; that will expose the pin so you can adjust the strap."
155151,1,"I have come to expect great quality from the Puma brand, and that's what I got with these flip flops. If you want something you can easily slip on and kick off, as well as enjoy comfort and style, look no further.Having said that, frankly I would rather pay less for a flip flop, but I'm paying for the brand essentially. Rest assured these aren't cheap pieces of rubber or plastic, though. There are three layers of platform material and the straps are nice. If you can afford the brand, go for it. It also may be worth noting thePuma basic sandal, which appears to potentially have even better support and comfort, is cheaper than the basic flip flop. I find that peculiar.Moving on, I brought these on vacation to Jamaica and I actually spotted someone else with the same exact pair. They were from Europe, proof that Puma is everywhere. We may have been the two most fashionable people on the beach! I'd say you can wear these flip flops just about anywhere - at the beach, at home, at work - but let me warn you that the thong post between your toes can become uncomfortable after awhile. Also, even though the outsole has somewhat of a grip, you should be careful on slippery surfaces. Other than those two caveats, these are comfortable and serve their purpose in a sexy manner."
316225,1,"These are quality moccasins, and extremely comfortable. The size ran slightly larger than actual size. I have another pair of Minnetonka Moccs and they were true to size, for some reason this pair is a little larger. I'm keeping them although they do slip off my heal a little but I'm concerned that if I go down 1/2 size they would be too small.Thank you for reading,Michelle"
313690,1,"Bought these for our 15yr old son at the beginning of High Soccer season. Best soccer shoes he's ever owned. Made it thru August, Sept and Oct with either 2 hours of games or practices at least 5 days per week with minimal wear. The insoles were the first to go, however, he's still playing in the shoes over the winter because they are more comfortable than the Diadoras he wanted to try next. The shoes come with leather conditioner - we used it about every two weeks plus we kept cedar shoe trees inside the shoes when not in use. Some other brands may be a few ounces lighter, but I doubt you'll be as happy with them."
124009,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
265163,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
63109,1,"After always wearing athletic shoes, I finally returned to my beloved Keds. They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy, clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes. I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do."
145327,1,Firstable I have to say that the service was perfect!!! They were perfectly in time and I really like them. They are warm and confortable. You must buy a smaller size. I usually wear 8/5-9 and I bought 8. Thank you Amazon!! and Happy Holidays to everybody!
248920,1,I absolutely love love love these boots!!! I'm a New Yorker living in Atlanta and im so used to wearing these boots so i was super excited to find them on Amazon...On top of the fast shipping they arrived before Christmas...These are my work boots and they were packaged just right... I'm very thankful...and great job Amazon!!
180113,1,"Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10, 20, 30 years ago, except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support, comfort etc. They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still, 5 stars from my view. They are what they are supposed to be."
54973,2,"I've ordered Ked's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality. The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $5. No support, thin canvas - just junk. I'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe. I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to. No support, no padding, more narrow, thinner canvas. I've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference. Save your money. You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $5-$8, it just won't have a Keds tag. This is no longer the bargain it once was. Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator. What's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe don't even know it's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago."
3974,1,"I purchased these in preparation of a hike up Mt. Leconte in Gatlinburg, TN. After breaking them in, they fit great. I didn't have a single problem the whole hike and look forward to using them for future hikes."
220538,1,i am very pleased with my purchase! i purchased these boots for my sons birthday they arrived sooner than expected in great condition! i had standard shipping and they arrived two days after i placed my order which was great so that i could complete my sons wardrobe for his birthday party! they were in good condition and authenic timberland quality!!! i would highly reccomend this seller to someone else!
261536,1,"Bought them for my husband's bday early this year, so far he doesnt complain. He said they are comfi. And ithey are also very stylish in every outfits; formal and casual. They are also cheaper than in stores. They are white, so of course will be so easy to get dirty but to me the dirtier they get, the more stylist they are. Lol."
6178,1,The new style of the T-macs. These are the best. They are very comfartable. I bought them the day they came out. If you are into black then buy them now. Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year. So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December. Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year.
120782,1,Not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised once they arrived. Delivery took forever because of the processing of the order...
292947,1,They keep me on track and in balance no matter what type of workout I am doing.
211889,1,I have worn Easy spirit Women's shoes for years and they are really a good shoe.Gives good support and always fits well.
142838,1,"I'm a loyal Reebok basketball shoe buyer, these being my 5th pair of Iverson's to date. I've worn Answer 3s through 7s, and they've always been pretty cool kicks with a strong court presence. I was skeptical about these at first cause they look too flashy with the pump and all however I've been proven wrong since I bought them 2 months ago. The Answer X pumps are legit, the pump system works incredibly well and gives you a truly close to custom fit sneaker. I really like the high ankle strap because of past ankle injurys I've had, with it I feel a lot more safe/stable. The pump works atuomatically as you walk. You simply turn it's knob to a setting and it'll inflate within your first 10-20 steps. I wear most of my Iverson's off the court as just stand alone sneakers, but not these. Theres no question about it, these are straight up baller shoes. I only use these when I play basketball, I don't wear them to or from the court, I take them off. If you're not wearing next generation basketball shoes for your game today, these shoes will blow you away. Definately is one of the best basketall shoes available right now. I haven't worn Kobe's or T-mac's, but I love these shoes so I'd be biased if I tryed the others right now. You won't be dissappointed with these. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5, is cause my pump knob lost it's sticker gauge and the knob feels flimsy sometimes now. Overall though I think they've helped my game, and are the best Iverson's to date."
61077,1,These shoes work excellent in a lot water conditions. My husband has been using them for more than 4 years. We tried others brands but this ones are the best.
372796,1,"These shoes were exactly what my son wanted for Christmas. He loves them. They run true to size and they are comfortable. He has a hard time keeping the tongue straight on the shoes. When he tightens the laces, it will stay in place."
45938,1,Very comfortable sandle. Hard to find a good quality sandle that offers support and leave your feet feeling good even after walking a long time. The sole is thick enough to absorb hard pavement. Best sandle I've ever owned.
65804,0,"Beautiful shoe, but way too tight. Had to return and order a 1/2 size up and am hoping it will fit."
249171,1,These are some of the most comfortable yet durable slippers I have ever worn. I needed something I could wear around the house every day but that could handle my hard wood floors. I think these are just the slipper.
147210,1,"My daughter wanted the tall gray classic Ugg boots for Christmas. I was worried that they would be sold out, or that the order would not arrive in time. It got here 3 days after I placed my order!!! The boots are great, and I am really impressed with the service - especially since shipping was free."
286356,1,"This is such a cute shoe and would be very comfortableb, but it runs small."
286990,2,Not very comfortable feeling.They are very hard and dont flex much at all. We returned this for Leo's Unisex Tap shoes.They were much softer and seemed better made.
56342,1,These are classic black gym shoes. We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play. These shoes were perfect.
337671,1,"Got the shoes really fast, however they didn't fit. Called the number got the information to verify they had the one I wanted in my size. Returned and got the replacement even faster than the original order. Excellent service. Will definately shop here again."
201334,1,"I bought these to replace a pair that I got over 15 years ago. That pair, BTW, was still in good condition except that the rubber sole had cracked and worn out. (I was able to have them re soled with a local rubber sole as the uppers were still very good and comfortable).The new shoes are identical to the old ones in terms of appearance. However, they seem to be a bit tight width wise, though this is probably due to the fact that they are new and need to be broken in a bit.These are THE classic boat shoe, recommended for everyone!!!"
62982,1,"So far, good for my daughter. Comfort on the feet, no issues, just love the Endless Style, like other brand name shoes for women. She's enjoying them. Happy Holidays."
331421,1,I have looked all over for red crocs and I found them here at a better price than the stores!
78822,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
275707,1,"These boots are quite the surprise! At first I thought ""another tennis shoe boot"" . Not so! I started to wear them to get a feel and they were pretty good out of the box. After a long committed hike of about ten miles I stopped and thought wow these are actually feeling BETTER than when I started! From there on I hunted in these for about 60 miles with close to 20 thousand verticle feet(checked by GPS). They were great! I have had two neuromas removed from my feet and soft shoes are a must have. These have been the best boots even against my Danners at half the weight and a quarter of the price. They also have great traction in all conditions. In wet deep grass they will get wet inside. They also don't stink inside unlike older boots of this type. Will I buy another pair? Well I'm shopping for another pair to replace these right now."
196815,1,I have been wearing Ariat Roper boots with my uniform for the past 5 years. They are always comfortable and I usually get about 2 years out of them before they look like they need to be replaced. They were usually dull in luster though and required frequent polishing to look good. This new Black Onyx is quite shiny to begin with and makes it much easier to look nice between wax jobs. I do remove the insoles that come with the boots and replace them with Dr. Scholls insoles that I find more comfortable. For me they are the perfect year round uniform footwear.
273580,1,"I've worn them all over Disney World-- twice-- and never had the slightest issue. They're comfortable and hold up from year to year. They're like walking on clouds.I've made converts of everyone in my family, including my 12 year old son who hates flip flops. I just ordered a new pair for everyone on the family, and 2 pair for me.Buy yourself a pair. You deserve it!"
379407,1,"Great seller, Super fast shipping. These are a great pair of shoes. They just have to be broken in before they'll truly preform at their best."
260403,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
8059,1,"These shoes are great, not too narrow, just wide enough for my feet, plus the cushions are good and its light. One of my favorite basketball shoes."
190779,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
18847,1,"I was worried that the shoes would be an ill fit. When they arrived I found my worries were for nothing because the shoes were true to size, not too snug or loose. The material is good, and the heel is strong! You don't have to worry about it snapping off if you have to do a lot of moving around (which happened to a pair of costume shoes I bought from a different seller!) they hold up fine. Highly recommended to break in the shoes before the event you plan to wear them for though otherwise you'll be sore all day. :) Also as other people have mentioned if you are a half size I would suggest ordering a size UP instead of DOWN."
22433,1,I have worn Easy spirit Women's shoes for years and they are really a good shoe.Gives good support and always fits well.
359247,1,"Dit not fit, but that was my own fault."
222006,1,"When will there be more colours and sizes in 9M available???? This is a very comfortable shoe and good wearing. Will more be offered and if so,when? When one finds a good shoe and style it is disheartening that more are not on offer. Why change a good,sure thing????"
7772,1,"Quick delivery brought my much needed white keds to me. I had my old pair for 7 years and they were falling apart. These are my favorites and I love the new keds logo showing on the side of the shoe rather than on the back. Very cool for keds! What else can I say, for 40 years +, keds classics have been there. I couldn't wait as a 7th grader back in the &*$@'s for my first pair and ditching those orthopedic white oxfords saddle shoes! Oh happy day! Been wearing them ever since. Now they come in a rainbow of colors (and new styles, too) but the white keds will always be a classic in my wardrobe!"
311994,0,"I was really excited to get these and try something different. The length fit fine, but was way too tight across and right behind the ball of my foot. I've got them on boot stretchers to try and widen them out. I'd seriously reconsider buying another pair."
18738,1,"I bought these a couple of months ago and thus far they are my favorite shoe. Good for running, great for standing, very stable. They did at first seem kind of tight at the very front, but that's probably for a more secure fit. If you're somewhere between sizes, I'd say go with the larger one."
187094,1,This is a wonderful shoe. I have always had trouble getting comfortable shoes but I really think these are great. The product description exactly matched what I received. The velcrose straps are perfect - I have had a lot of trouble in the past finding shoes with velcrose straps. I have undergone 3 spine surgeries and needed something comfortable that was easy to put on and do up. The shoes arrived in a timely manner and were clean and new. I have to do a lot of walking and have found these shoes to be the best I have experienced. I will definately purchase these again. Thanks for a great shoe!
257563,1,THIS BOOT IS VERY NICE. I FINE THAT IT IS A BIT NARROW AT THE TOES COMPARE TO THE OTHER STYLE LIFESTRIDE BOOTS THAT I HAVE. I'M HOPING THEY WILL STRECTH A LITTLE BIT AS I WEAR THEM. I WISH THEY CAME IN NAVY BLUE!
39598,1,"Definitely order at least 1 size up- they run small and seem very narrow. If you have a wide foot, then these probably are not for you. I am a 9 and ordered a 10, but I wish mine were a half size larger. I've only worn them a couple times and they seem comfy enough- I do notice the difference in arch support between these and my cheapo Target flip flops that needed to be retired this year. I would definitely buy these again, but I would order a size 11- a full 2 sizes larger than I normally wear."
356259,1,"They look beautiful! A little slick, but that can be taken care of with some a little scuffing."
231334,1,"Being a Letter Carrier for the past 30 years,these are the best boots I've ever worn.I've had the conquest boot in the past and lasted about 4-5 years. After that boot, went to a less expensive boot to save a few bucks and made a big mistake,went back to the sorel boot and can't be more satisfied.They give you the support and warmth you need to work in the cold weather.So good,I purchased a second set to have on hand.sorel is the best."
180284,1,I love my converse! You should get some too. I love theway they look and smell when they are brand new! They come in allKind of colors and you can make your own . they have lasted on theMarket since 1935! You need to run and your own pair right now!
199249,1,"I bought these for my Dad and he loves them. You get what you pay for. These shoes maybe a little more money than others that look similar, but they are far better. High qualityleather , and made so well. My Dad has a large foot and it's hard to find shoes that fit comfortably and these fit the bill! A+++++++++++"
7087,1,I like me fuzzy slippersthese are a bit expensive and feel tight on the footthey are warm thoughthere are less expensive slippers from the same sellerprobably have the same tiny slot to put yer foot inmaybe they will stretch outwe'll see they came in todaythey shipped first and arrived last
232340,1,"As a nurse I have to say I love these shoes! Bought them after an EXTREAMLY expensive pair of shoes came in contact with a code brown! These shoes have no cloth parts to worry about-- Loves the patient but didnt want to carry her code brown around with me in the fine mesh on my shoes! -- Also the treads are amazing-- no need for a knife-- toothpick etc to remove... dirt? just wipe them off-- they are really really comfy, convienient and best of all easy to clean. I have found the shoe for the rest of my nursing career here!"
150352,1,"I had purchased these shoes long time back(purchased in 2005). They are still going good now. The sole is slightly worn out on the side, but rest of the shoe is good. Fits perfectly, does not slip and very comfortable."
139827,1,These are my mothers shoes. She really love them. Don't hurt her feet at all. She has worn these kind of shoes for years.
241002,1,"I have this boots just a few day and use it just a few , i like this product, if in the next monts I don't find any problem I'll buy a new ones, no the same model, but the same comberse products"
303494,0,Cute shoes but my feet bulge at the sides (8M seems more like narrow). I'm not comfortable with the way they look on me so I hardly ever wear them.
125207,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
344131,1,"I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe."
371816,1,I love them! I actually wore them last night! They are very comfortable ad the know doesn't bother me at all. I would recommend them to anyone.
353910,1,"At first, these boots are really warm, I used it in -5oC and it worked 100%. Second - they are really comfortable, and not heavy at all (heavier than sneakers, but light for the boot). the only problem I've got, is that it's hard to maintain it clean, or undamaged, but for me it doesn't matter, I bought these boots for hard working purposes. So I recommend you to try and buy these ones, they'll provide warmth and protection in any weather (in my opinion)"
72162,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
50837,1,"Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine since 2002 I dont skate so much but I love the style, this shoes was a little bit bigger but it's ok..good choise VANS OLD SCHOOL"
49754,2,"Unfortunately, I did not received this product on time so I had to wear something else. This will not stop me from ordering from Amazon again. When I receive it I will give a further review."
200113,1,"These aren't quite the quality of my previous Sperry Topsiders, but they're still really excellent shoes. These are a hair tighter and the leather quality isn't quite as soft. However, I believe that if you're looking for boat shoes, you'll have trouble finding better shoes than these."
217450,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
180479,1,"...Chuck Taylor All Stars are good for doing squats. That's why I buy them. A lot of athletic shoes have a good amount of padding on the bottom, which is fine for running, but while doing squats, makes my feet feel slightly wobbly. The Taylors allow my feet to stay firmly planted, which helps me maintain proper technique."
243281,1,"I'm so glad I brought these shoes for my father because he's been wanting a pair for so long, so I got them and he loves them. They're a great Shoe for a great price."
90939,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
318622,1,14+ hours and no pain...must have....you will love them and they last 6-8 months if you wear them everyday...just bring the price down and will buy in bulk...
377367,1,"I bought these slippers as a gift for my teenage son, who has not liked wearing slippers in the past. He says they are warm and likes that they are easy to get on and off. However, they became a little too big after he wore them for two weeks. I had ordered size 16, since many reviewers had suggested ordering one size larger than actual foot size to get a good fit. My son has decided to keep them anyways instead of waiting for an exchange pair. They appear to be constructed well and I hope they will last for a while."
250394,0,"This is the second pair of boots I've owned of this style, and I forgot how cheap they were. My old pair of steel toes have worn out, so I wanted a cheap leather boot to transplant the toe caps in.There's really not many great things about this boot apart from its price and it actually is pretty waterproof. It takes a hell of a long time to break in, the leather/constructed is cheap, there was a staple sticking out of the sole into my foot (it was easily removed, but still, wtf?), and I KNOW the insoles are gonna fall apart by spring. I would have also liked to have known that they were made in ChinaFinally, in an unexpected flaw, after the first time wearing them out the laces tore up the tongue and stripped the finish on the leather. That's likely something you can't fix. Considered sending them back over this.I'm not saying they're not decent once they brake in and take a few beatings, but just be weary that your buying some of the cheapest leather boots out there, likely made in a sweatshop."
249017,1,I'm a professional gardener and it's hard to find a good workshoe made for women. This is a great work shoe - provides good support and is well made.
16242,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."

355042,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylor's since the varsity issued them in High School. I wear a half size (can't get them @ the mall). Amazon had my size & color selection (this is the third pair I've bought-I'm still playing). Everything else (convenience, getting the order right, getting them delivered quickly, etc.) was excellent. I'll buy @ Amazon again."
8061,1,"On my third pair in last many years. Must be satisfied with this model. You will be pleased with these for yard work, hiking or general industrial work."
20065,1,Comfortable and practical shoes at a reasonable price with prompt delivery. I've been wearing Rockport shoes for decades. I know what size Rockports fit me so I'm safe buying them on line. This is my second pair purchased on line and I have no regrets.
121153,1,"I have worn these shoes for years. They last me about 7 years (alternating black and tan ones, that is). Have them re-soled several times. The leather is thick and high quality so the shoes are initially stiff and require breaking in. This takes wearing a few times and I have even gotten blisters during break-in. But, once they fit you, they are great and polishing and sole dressing makes them look new after several years of use."
355118,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
344865,1,"I hate you guys, seriously! No, not the product! The shoes are absolutely wonderful. No, no, I hate the people who reviewed these shoes.Why? The majority of the reviews say to order smaller than you normally would if you are a half size. And, well, I did just that and the shoes do not fit! I repeat: Do not order small, they will not fit.I'm a 7 1/2 normally. I ordered a size 7 - like ya'll told me to - and guess what? My toes are beyond scrunched in 'em. These are absolutely unwearable and I will be exchanging them for an 8.Thank heavens the event I need these for is still over a month away. I hope this review gets read so people don't have to go through the same thing."
56923,1,"Love these shoes! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best! Great price and super fast shipping! Couldn't,t be happier!"
174907,1,Bought this for my son. Thought that I had the wrongsandal but customer service was great in helping me.This was the double stack. Did not look like that fromthe side. You must look on the inside of the foot.He is happy with sandal.
54914,1,"I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found."
13226,1,This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors. Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great. You can't go wrong with this shoe.
300693,1,What can I say great shoes and a competitive price. These shoes take the rough beating that a toddler can levy on shoes. They look great and are easy to clean given they are waterproof.
343431,1,These Grasshoppers are an identical replacement for a pair I have worn to shreds and couldn't bear to part with as they are comfortable and durable and fit well. They were hard to find and I was delighted to find them on Amazon.com. My purchase went smoothly and the order arrived as promised.Roz

141929,1,these boots are great. the only grip i have is that the buckels are cheap. i had mine replaced by a very good boot repairer. i live in washington and it's very wet here and i've had no problems with these boots. i highly recommend them if you are to wear boots alot. also they are soft and there is no brake in time.
105896,0,"I have recived the converse shoe yesterday.. opened the box and took a close look at them, really do not like the finish and they really do not look original to me. i am thinking of returnig them"
367149,0,"I bought this last year for ski boots. It worked ok, but the biggest problem is that it tends to tip over if the load is not balanced. So I end up loading it back-left, front-right, back-right, then front-left. It works, but a little awkward.Also, for some ski boots & buckles, the posts are too close together, so it required ADDITIONAL planning to load it so that everything fits.Also, my recollection is that the air is not really WARM, just adequate.Bottom line: I will probably continue to use this. But I will be buying a similar item as a present this Christmas, and am looking for a different brand/model, that may not have these issues."

216695,1,"For all of those people who would rather pet the animals than wear them, these are the shoes for you! Converse has been making ""Chuck Taylor's"" longer than I have been alive and not one animal has lost it's life to make them! The only downside to Converse is that they are not the most comfy shoe, however, a insole insert fits rather nicely into them and then your good to go."
94174,1,I got these shoe in black. Great fit and are very comfortable.Lady Darline
153014,1,"These shoes are really cute and pretty comfortable (relative to other brands. For Aerosoles, they're one of the least comfortable styles I've owned). Overall, great product. Note: if you have wide feet, order a 1/2 size up because these shoes are somewhat narrow."
370748,1,"These were a perfect fit for my girl, she was excited to see them under the tree. She loves them and the were shipped very quickly."
344886,1,"The shoes I got were the pink glitter ones. They were true to fit, perfect for my Halloween costume and very comfortable. I gave only 4 stars because they were a little stiff and the glitter caused some snags in my knee high stockings. Overall, highly recommended."
228942,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
289985,1,I've worn Bostonians for over 15 years and they are great for my weird feet. I'm wide at the toes and narrow at the heels and the Bostonian wides fit me great. They last forever - I have one pair that is on its second re-sole.
378043,0,"It felt so tight and uncomfortable for my instep when first tried on. Not sure whether it's an exceptional irregular pair or it meant to be tight for it's my first time to try for the volleyball shoes. But throughout the first game with my new shoes, other than it felt a bit tight to 'breathe', it's overall comfortable and stable, better than my non-volleyball shoes."
183831,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
223278,0,One of the shoes already had creases in it from wear when the package arrived. Other than that they are alright.
220959,1,I love these shoes! I got the Cotton Candy pink ones and they are the first shoes in a very long time that i can say are REALLY COMFORTABLE. No blisters no pain. they dont slip off when you walk in them they tie really well they look really awesome!!! They are true to size. I am a size 7 and a 7 fits perfectly. Love them!!
378918,0,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
220612,1,Looks just as I thought it would. The sizing is acurate no problems with shipping or anything! I love them. And now I know a great way to purchase shoes without the holiday hassle
234251,1,"I actually bought the ST 349 at Dicks Sporting Goods store Very similar shoe, but probably newer. I really liked the looks of this shoe and when I put it on, it fit me perfectly. I didn't even wait for the sales guy to come back (he was obviously busy being the only guy working in the shoe dept at Dicks with 3 other customers), so I threw them in the box and proceeded to the checkout. The shoe was 69.99 retail marked down $10 to $59.99, but when the girl rang it up, I got it for $22.45!!! Being the honest guy I try to be, I questioned it, she rung it up again and it came up $22.45. Well, I couldn't get checked out any quicker. I felt like if I waited too long she'd change her mind, but I did indeed get it for $22.45. Hell, I couldn't get a pair of cheap shoes at wally world for that price, so I was VERY HAPPY walking out of the store with a $70 pair of shoes for $22. They really felt good when I tried them on and they looked great, so I think I got an exceptional deal. This is my first pair of KSwiss. I'd bought Nike mostly before, but I really like these shoes. KSwiss has been making sneaks since 1966 (when I was 7 years old) so I figger they must know what the hell they're doing by now. Buy these shoes. they're great (especially if you get the deal I got)."
121577,1,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. I ended up getting the wrong size, but all I had to do was call Amazon and they sent me a return label via email. I was reimbursed the next day and was able to get the correct size sandal the next day as well. This was was all done just a few days before Christmas. Super easy."
183703,1,"I bought my first pair and loved them, now on second pair and still love them. Sturdy, forgiving but still rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. I do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia."
342949,1,"Grasshopper Jensen's are my favorite 'comfy' shoes. I like the leather styles (those are called smooth) and also the twill/canvas, which breathe more than the leather. I have several different pair, and have also purchased these as gifts."
229912,0,"I carefully went over all the details before I ordered this pair of shoes. Hi tops - check. Size 7.5 - check. White - check. Chuck Taylor - check. Everything seemed excellent. That is, until I opened the box (which arrived just on schedule by the way). By some mistake I had received a pair of very nice looking low tops. Which would have been perfect if that was what I'd ordered. Now, the shoes have been sent back, and a new pair is on its way."
68271,1,I use them in vollyball. I had Gel-1110s before which were better than these in weight and cushioning but I couldnt find that model so I tried these.Summary of my experience:ComfortableGood heel supportGood gripvery flexibleReasonably light weight.

60370,1,"Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints."
115559,1,"I just purchased my third pair of Bonnie Lites and own wine, black and taupe. I have knee problems and a hard insole really hurts my knees. The Bonnie Lites are well padded and like walking on pillows. Stylish and comfortable!"
13626,1,"needs I say more, simply amazing, you will look like wonder woman! Pay attention to calf measurements not normal shoe size for better fitting"
239758,1,"Received these shoe's prior to departing for Ruidoso, NM. Very comfortable and the STEALTH technology soles worked really well on slippery surfaces. Received the wrong color (Green vice Khaki) but I liked the color so I kept them."
347552,1,"Needed for a wedding and they worked. They are a little tight but I'm stretching them out, width wise but other than I like them a lot!"
92375,1,"I will never understand why Reebok discontinued the original BB4600 high tops--they were simply the best ever made. PERIOD. Hopefully, Reebok will start making them again soon. These high tops (especially the ones from the 1980s-early'90s) were far better than comparable shoes from Nike, Puma, Pony and Converse--not surprisingly, they go for impressive prices at online markets like Ebay."
4269,1,"Over the years I've typically bought much higher end hiking boots but was tired of spending over $200 and wanted to find something comparable at a lower price point. These were recommended to me by a friend and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. I was not disappointed. I have taken them out a few times for both long (12-14 hour) and short (4-6 hour)hikes after breaking them in around the house for a couple of weeks. As a geologist I've also worn them to do field work a number of times and they have held up to climbing, hiking and all manner of abuse while doing field work. They are extremely comfortable on my foot and ankle, have given me no blisters and are light enough not to tire you out after a long morning of trekking through whatever it is you want to trek through. I didn't find my feet getting hot or developing hot spots and in the end, forgot about my feet altogether (Which is a first). They are waterproof as promised and heavy dew, shallow streams/mud puddles won't even phase them as my feet stayed dry all day long. The only test remains to be how well they stand up over time. I inspect my boots after every use and so far, they don't appear to have any weak spots at all. I highly recommend these boots for medium to light duty hiking or work scenarios."
201700,0,"Nice shoe, good quality leather. The band around the foot doesn't allow alot of expansion so it hurts the bunions. If it weren't for bunions, these are perfect, comfortable shoes."
382259,1,"I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that. But, once on, they are the most moldable, soft, well fitting and supportive sandals I have. I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily. Another complaint is that they are so hard to find! I have several pairs and will keep looking..."
317044,1,"This is my 8th pair of this style of New Balance shoes. The fit is great. I wear size 15 EE and I'm so happy to be able to find them. I do a lot of walking in my profession, I'm a caregiver, then while I'm out and about. I wear them so much they last about a year and I need new ones. Other shoes are okay but in a health care setting I need something that is kind of fun yet clean looking while offering great support during a very long day. These are the shoes!"
264561,0,"These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
145656,1,"These are my second pair of UGGs and just like the first pair, they did not disappoint! They are very warm and comfortable. They are a perfect fit! I had them in 2 days which is GREAT! I will definitely return when I'm interested in another pair!"
133125,1,my girlfriend had and old pair that she loved so i bought her a new pair. great product.
135999,1,What can I say? I've had mine for about 4 years and still wear them. They are quality made and extremely comfortable. They go great with just about everything. They are kinda my go-to shoe when nothing else I have matches.
28131,1,"After a brief period of breaking in, these shoes are very comfortable. I wear them to work sometimes. I work in healthcare, so I am walking or standing 90% of the day. These shoes are supportive and comfy all day!"
41796,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
63157,1,"At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i didn't want to get charged twice. but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that didn't fit (and obviously didn't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender). bottom line: definitely worth it and if you need a smaller or bigger size, definitely take the time to exchange. super easy!"
151546,1,"Great looking boots, very happy with quality and overall very pleased with purchase. Need one half size smaller, and I knew that when I ordered as other comments recommended this."
66710,1,"Like the previous reviewer, I also had to buy a 1/2 size smaller than what I normally wear. I recommend it with these sneakers unless you need a wider size."
27967,1,These are my favorite shoes. I will be so sad if they ever stop making them. They are the most comfortable for walking or for casual.
321042,1,These shoes last for SO long and fit great. The color is perfect and they are wonderful to dance in.
185607,1,"these sneakers are so comfortable but supportive, without cutting off circulation or pinching anywhere. they are light and breathable and let in a lot of air as you run. initially i was afraid to buy running sneakers so squishy and comfortable because i thought they wouldn't be supportive enough, but they are, and have a great gel padding that supports as you run. sizes seem to run a teeny bit smaller than most other brands, which worked out great for me."
64031,0,I had these same sneakers in the past and same size etc and they fit well. These hurt my feet after a little while so I haven't worn them in a while. I know I cant return them as I wore them for an hour out in the yard so they are a little dirty. I just think they aren't made the same as they were about 10 years ago.
313401,1,"I bought these boots for my son, he is going on a camping trip at the end of Jan. He needed a boot that would keep him both dry and warm. He love's them!"
163607,1,"I've been wearing this shoe longer than I care to remember. I think this is my third or fourth pair - not because they wear out too soon but because I know when I buy them that I will be able to get several years of supportive wear out of them. They clean up easily, they have long lasting support, and they continue to be comfortable wear after wear."
122174,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
71829,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
23175,1,"PEOPLE,DIS PAIR OF SHOES IS DA BEST PAIR OF SHOES YOU WILL EVA BUY,I LOOK EVA SO PIMP IN EM',I BRING ALL DA LADIES TO DA COURT,AND THEY LOVE DA WAY I PLAY BASKETBALL,I REALLY RECCOMENDATIZZAL THAT YOU BUY THESE SHOES FOR RIZZAL,AND WHEN YOU DO BUY DA P.I.M.P SHOES,ALL THE LADIES WILL BE ASKIN YOU RO SHIZZAL WITH YO NIZZAL,PEACE TO THE BROTHAS IN DA HOOD WHO HAVE DA T MACS,SIGHNED,YO MAMMA."
201005,1,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
386687,1,"I have been ordering and wearing these shoes as casual work shoes for 10 years. They are well made, a good price and the thing I like the most about them is how many different sizes/widths are available. Once you find the size you need you can depend on always getting a shoe that will fit."
293516,0,I don't recommend his shoes for people who have wide feet...But I love the design!
221266,1,"I like the bag a lot, and appreciate the different pockets. But I do wish the strap was much wider, because it's kinda thin and flimsy."
106722,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
309819,1,"Worn these for two plus yrs. now. Sole is almost still new looking.Positives: The soles do not wear and are soft enough to protect your back, legs and feet when walking. Are waterproof and warm but not hot. Comfortable after broken in.Negatives: Scuff easily, hard to maintain. Shoe laces break after a short period of time. Could feel heavy to a person not used to weighty boots.July 2009-Still going strong. This is an exceptional boot Even though it looks like it has been through a war (or two)-comfort ++."
302787,1,"The shoes are excellent quality, good looking and very comfortable. The sizing for my particular shoe size is very good (not too tight, not too loose). The order turn around was excellent."
97781,1,"I love Crocs. They're a great substitute for slippers around the house and you can wear them outside. Your feet stay cool and breathe. They won't get sweaty like they do in sneakers/tennis shoes. One warning: don't wear them on the treadmill. I didn't find they gave me enough support there, but they are great for casual wear around the house or running errands. They wear very well. I wear mine almost every day and have had them for 4 years. Might try some other styles in the Crocs brand."
165331,0,"I love the style, and the padded footbed is nice, but with the heel heighth and thong, this is not a comfortable shoe! While not as uncomfortable as one without padding, the thong still rubs a bit (more so than other pairs I have) and as with all heels, your feet feel it after wearing them for awhile."
240153,1,I am very pleased with this- the leather is nice & it was shipped promptly
2205,1,"Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!"
150527,1,"They look nice with most everything, and as long as you keep them nice and white and clean, you can't get in trouble for wearing them with skirts, shorts, or jeans. Everyone should own a pair."
74668,1,"This shoe was superb when I used it for my highschool football team. I was able to run my fastest and not feel dragged down by a pound of lead, with out the high cut ankle support I was able to cut faster and throw off almost all of my defenders. This shoe really did enhance my perfromance. Ideal for wide receivers and running backs."
300135,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
333569,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband because he is on his feet all day. He enjoys wearing them and states that he has not had any cramps in his legs or feet. The only thing that I notice about them that I am unsure of is the material on the upper part, toe area. It appears a little thin, but perhaps that is because this a walking shoe. I am hoping they are able to endure his daily routine."
200347,1,"I bought these to replace a pair that I got over 15 years ago. That pair, BTW, was still in good condition except that the rubber sole had cracked and worn out. (I was able to have them re soled with a local rubber sole as the uppers were still very good and comfortable).The new shoes are identical to the old ones in terms of appearance. However, they seem to be a bit tight width wise, though this is probably due to the fact that they are new and need to be broken in a bit.These are THE classic boat shoe, recommended for everyone!!!"
246259,1,"REALLY LOOKS GREAT...only think it they tend to run a bit large im a 10.5 and the 10.5 is a bit too big. Other than that boots are comfortable, good looking...very satisfied"
102835,1,"These are comfortable with good arch support. They are lightweight and flexible and make my zumba work out more fun. Definitely worth it. As others have said, order one size larger than your normal shoe size. Also, I have wide feet and these fit well."
207021,1,"This product is fantastic!!! Coming from Florida and going to school in Vermont, I needed a pair of sturdy easy to slip on winter boots. And these fit the bill. I love how they look, and the thicker sole with traction keep you from slipping much better than the regular UGGs. They are also much cheaper!!! Plus the elevated sole keeps you off the salt so you don't ruin your boots. Buy them true to size they are a bit tight at first but strech out after a few wears. For the price and quality these boots are a must have in winter climates."
197366,1,"After wearing the high tops for basketball, I wanted a pair of the low tops that I could wear in the summer with shorts without looking like a complete idiot. These are possibly my favorite shoes (bearing in mind, I'm a guy). They're comfortable, and since they're made of canvas, my feet don't get hot while wearing them. I haven't had a problem with them getting cold either. I'd say the biggest plus over the high tops is the ease in which I'm able to put them on. You dont have to unlace half the shoe to be able to put your foot in it. The only disappointment I have is that the shoes aren't any less expensive on amazon as they are in retailers around my area."
184366,1,"I think these shoes are very comfortable. I will buy again, maybe in different color. I bought black this time."
13901,1,"I love these shoes and have them in blue, white and black. I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts. fit true to size."
138294,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
7906,1,"Second pair that i have purchased for working a 12 hour shift. Boots are steel toed, rated for 600 volts, and light and flexible. Feel like regular boots. I even wear them on my days off sometimes as they are a good looking shoe. Company purchases 1 pair of safety shoes per year, and after 16 years i have gone through many different brands of safety shoes. These are the best. No leg fatigue or foot pain. They come in wide size, but normal size fits fine. I enjoy the added safety of the 600 volts rating as i work around high voltage constantly."
85073,0,"Everyone I know who has these absolutely loves them. For whatever reason, however, I have not been able to find a size that does not slide off of my foot... if it is too small, it forces my heel off the back, if it is too big, my heel falls off the back, if it is just right, my heel still fall off the back when I move. People rave about these things, but they didn't work for me (for context, I used them for a backpacking trip through shenandoah VA... I could not wear them to hike the streams because they came off right away. They've been permanently demoted to my stationary bathing shoes)"
216048,1,This is what you use to soften the shoe surface before stretching it. Easy - just spray where you need it.
188998,1,"My husband has been wearing this brand and style shoes for over twenty years. They are long lasting, comfortable, and functional. They're not only great on the deck of a boat, but stylish with casual slacks or shorts. They are highly recommended."
69470,1,The clogs are just what I need for working in the Garden. They fit just right and the vented croc keeps my feet from becoming too hot. The clean up is quick with the spray from the garden hose.
184266,1,I LOVED THE SHOES. IT CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION AS IF I BOUGHT IT IN THE STORE. FITS GREAT AND VERY COMFORTABLE
299191,1,"My daughter suffers from a mild case of Epidermolysis Bullosa which causes the skin on her feet and hands to blister, these are soft and don't irrate her feet, well worth the money an super cute. I had to shorten up the back strap a little but once I did that they are pretty much perfect. She wears a size 8/9 in regular crocs and all the reviews said they run big, I ordered the smaller size but they were too small and so I got the 8/9."
128865,1,I have a finished basement than can get pretty cold so I went to look for something that was good and affordable. I got it in these slippers . The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is that the small pulling tab at back of one slipper ripped off the 2nd time I put them on. No biggie though.
234681,0,"a good looking shoe but not to be recommended to buy unseen and untried. For the size on the shoe, it is SMALL and therefore a v tight fit. I would not buy this brand again via the internet"
346367,1,"I dont think I would recommend these for sports but they are great for just walking. I work in the city and have to dress up but weather permitting, I always walk from my car or train to the office in these, and then change to my formal shoes. Going home, I do the reverse. I find them very comfortable and they hold up well. I highly recommend them for these types of activities but they dont have enough tread for sports."
197637,1,they are so confortable and so cool and nice too wear.i love them and i would buy 10 more if i could.
44630,1,"these are well cushioned and nice looking, was very pleased with these and glad I got both colors. the velcro strap is a lot easier than buckle versions. these would look good with shorts, slacks or jeans"
263904,1,I got these shows and began to wear them right off to break them in. I have to say if you stand for a long period of time dont wear them. If you are weight lifting with them then they work great. They have no real arch support because they were originally made back in the day before they had arch support. But great shoes!!
76486,1,These shoes are wonderful! So easy to clean and are amazingly comfortable. I wear them all the time! Can't wait to get them in more colors!
5183,1,I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these.
188782,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
20116,0,"I love this World Tour shoe, have owned a few pair over the years. It's being discontinued apparently, meaning stocks are limited, so buyer beware: the default Sand picture that comes up on this page is not what you get if ordering that color with Gabriel Shoes; they sent me a box of Sand Nubuck instead, a rather effeminate yellowish tint entirely different from the Sand model that is pictured and was ordered. It was shipped in a remolded, taped-shut standard USPS priority mail medium flat rate box (11 7/8"" x 3 3/8"" x 13 5/8""). That's right, a 3.5-inch-high box remolded around a standard Rockport size-11.5 shoe box, end flaps not quite touching each other instead of overlapping, taped shut to contain the contents. Picture that cheeseball level of professionalism. Upon returning to vendor (using my own box, no way would my post office accept their original ship box), the order itself was promptly refunded by Amazon of course, but not the **$29 total shipping charges** to receive ($14) and return ($15) their screwed-up shoe order. I lost big time; don't do the same."
7688,1,"I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however, they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun. I might hafta order this in a wider size... :D"
305841,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
240969,0,The sandals look nice and sexy but the problem with them that just after a couple of days the upper ankle strap with its zipper went out of sole due to not good quality of glueing. The next shoes seems to go the same way.
371214,1,"These shoes are fabulous! They are cute and sexy, but they are also very comfortable on."
241382,1,"I read all of the reviews of these shoes which were all positive and I totally agree. However, I have to admit that the main reason for my choice was the sales price ($38)and free shipping. They're very comfortable and meet all of my needs."
102155,2,"They're cheap, what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet. NONE.Need to break them in or they'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by.. Brash, I think. They're much better quality and cheaper as well."
154244,1,Great shoes! this must be my 5 pair. Like walking on air. Just wish the laces were a little shorter.
335505,0,"I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, and first ordered on product recommendation to go up a size, to women's 9. Wrong way, folks. So after returning and getting an women's 8/men's 6 I still am sliding around in this pair. They're still way too wide at the heel end, and about a half-inch too long. I do think a women's 7 would be too small and am tired of returning. So I'll keep them and just be very careful going up hills and stairs. Wish they still made crocs in Canada!"
334643,1,"This was the first time I have ever had a pair of Clark Wallabee boots, But make no mistake it will sure not be the Last pair. After I had the first pair for a week I ordered another pair of a different color but the same shoe, And both pair fit great and feel like a million Dollars."
157159,1,These are the most comfortable long-distance walking shoes ever! They provide comfort and support and are just as comfortable with orthotics. They are great right out of the box without any break-in period.
230701,1,"I bought the 6"" premium Timberland boots and they are fantastic.They look even better in person. My son wears a size 15 shoe and we bought these in 15's. They fit nice, but are a bit on the large side. A 1/2 size approx.Nothing a pair of med. weight pair of socks won't fix though.Definitely keeping.We have owned several Timberland boots prior to these and have been very happy with this brands quality and durability.The materials; the leather, soles and even the laces are top notch. Was told these are very comfortable to wear, with good support.Even better was the price for under $70.00 !"
182424,1,"Shipping was a little slower than normal, but outstanding price can not fine many size 7, I've been using amazon.com and you just can not beat the deals!! best boots ive had in a long time. use the wish list and keep checking daily if your looking for something. I got the boots for around $[...] 200 plus reg. price.."
117036,1,GREAT WALKING SHOE.IF YOU HAVE A WIDE FOOT MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE WIDE STYLE.THESE SHOES RUN VERY TIGHT.
375554,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
249896,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
111915,0,One of the shoes already had creases in it from wear when the package arrived. Other than that they are alright.
243252,1,"Originally went for 15s as I usually wear a 14 1/2 or 15, but this was way way too big. Got the 14's instead and they are actually a little long in the toe. Absolutely no support in these shoes at all, not that I was really expecting any. Just wanted to try them out. They are great as far as outfitting goes...they go with anything. But, do not plan on doing any major hiking in them. They are casual shoes and are for just that...being casual! Overall not a bad shoe though!"
224966,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
384491,1,"Shoes are true to size, super cute, and SOOOOOO comfy! I expected them to not be too comfy, but they are awesome. The star accents are removable clips, so you can move or remove them when ever you wish!"
388747,0,"The shoes are exactly what I wanted, and at a great price, but it is inappropriate for Amazon and Jos. A Banks to list them at a 27% discount when most of that discount disappears with what has to be the highest shipping and handling rates for shoes sold by Amazon. The shipping was $13.95 plus a $4 ""handling"" charge for shoes (most of the other Amazon shoe sellers have free shipping)! Also note Jos. A Banks charges an ""estimated"" sales tax where most of the other Amazon shoe vendors do not. My $119.99 shoes ended up with almost $30 in add-ons for a total of $149.32 (for an actual 9.5% discount). I still got a decent deal, but it was a complete letdown to get dinged so bad by Jos. A Banks fine print!!"
254205,1,I asked for a black converse all star. Shoes arrive on time as schedules and in perfect condition! They came in their original box.
227725,1,"Oh these are lovely. The colour is just one of a kind. Thoroughly enjoying them. i think I will buy another pair as at the rate that I am wearing them, they might not lat long...."
305061,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
228718,1,Chucks are the perfect shoe. They came quickly and it was easy. The shoes fit perfect and they've been great!
261976,1,"Honestly, I've been wearing these shoes since I was 16. I'm now 23 and refuse to wear anything else. I tend to go through a pair a year (Ohio winters are harsh on shoes) and have 5-6 pairs in my closet just in case Eastland decides to stop making this style.The absolute most comfortable, most durable shoe I've ever come across. If told to choose between these shoes and my mother....I'd have a REALLY hard time picking."
157777,1,"you know the shoe and you know the star. the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now. I have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style. real nice, real nice."
337428,1,I like the design that it put an extra layer at the front of theshoes. -- I have bought many different brand shoes for my son. Theyalways started to break at the front. I will see if this pair is different.
172514,0,I purchased these to wear with my halloween costume. They look great but rub in several places so I am returning them. I tried walking around the house in them to test them out and it just won't work out without multiple bandaids and a gel insert for the instep. Pretty shoes. Wish I could wear them.
17403,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
109946,1,"I really like this shoe. I wear a narrow shoe and it is sometimes difficult to find narrow ones. However, this shoe runs quite narrow. I'm quite confident that it will ""streatch"" out with some wear as the shoe is genuine leather. All in all, I am pleased with the shoes."
8893,1,"I ordered these shoes, the price was great!!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience."
311844,0,I like this shoe its comfortable and looks nice. The only thing that I've been disappointed about so far is that after I washed shoes on gentle cycle some of the pieces started to separate from the shoe.
263595,0,I returned the shoes for the correct size. Please advise the status of replacing them.Thanks
313739,1,"Budget Jungle Boots Avalible From ""[...]"" - Constant wetness is the main problem in the jungle, with the need for ankle support and protection from sharp sticks and rocks. With rubber soles, these boots keep out water from damp ground while allowing the feet to breath through the canvas uppers. After wading a river, the action of walking squirts water out of special steel vents in the instep. The cleats are wide and deep for good grip on wet ground. This is very good boots!"
52395,1,These are the best shoes I have purchased without paying hundreds of dollars for them. Excellent for someone who has to be on their feel all day!
325940,1,"Love the clogs, the sizing chart was not helpful, ordered the wrong size, waiting for exchanges."
223779,1,My husband only likes Reeboks/and only likes white sneakers.These are perfect and a perfect price! He's been wearing themsince they arrived!
280729,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
313416,1,"Bought these for my two year old granddaughter. So far they've held up nicely through several early season campouts in the Wash. Cascades. She's worn them in the rain with her rainsuit, and splashing in puddles when it wasn't raining, but the boots kept her feet dry as advertised. And they look adorable on her as well! Great service, fast shipping, overall an excellent online purchase."
218334,2,"I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars. I had All Stars that lasted well over five years. Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time. The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before. Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today. One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole: the pinstripe on the sole of high quality shoes is thick and solid. While the pinstripe on the Converses of today are thin and weak (and they rip and tear off from my experiences; something that NEVER happened with the quality of before) That's just one indicator. There are many subtle differences that combined make a huge difference in overall quality and durability. The quality went down since Nike bought Converse some time ago (and yet the prices went up). But the style is classic and if you like to wear new-looking Converse, then the Converse of today will do for you. But if you're like me and prefer sporting your kicks dirty and beat-up and for an extended period of time, I suggest you go on Ebay and buy a pair of Converse kicks from before. But you're going to have to bid high because after all, you'll be bidding on high quality and awesome durability, which is something the Converses of today do not have."
234986,1,Ordered this shoe as a gift for my sister...she loves it. Says its comfortable and goes with anything. Definitely recommend this shoe to those who want just an everyday type shoe :)
259958,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
100075,1,My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and has a terrible problem with shoes. This shoe works very well for her. She wears a size 5WW which is very hard to find in shoe stores. I was able to get these on sale with Amazon's help. I couln't believe how quickly we received them... Great service....
244193,1,"This is a belt pouch or a bag. I've used it heavily and it hasn't fallen apart yet. Not sure what else one can really say about a bag... it's especially green and the snap is... snappish. It's also bigger than I thought it would be. I could, in fact, place a sandwich in it while hiking if I chose to (I don't but, I could)."
11533,1,1. SEXY2. COMFY3. GOOD QUALITYReport Signature shoes never let me down!
244041,1,Great product!I'll highly recommend.My only comment: it has not the inside flower design as shown in the photo
253956,1,I ordered this shoe for my son. He wanted a good skate shoe. I wanted a reasonable price. We got both.
287113,0,This is not the shoe that it replaced. It is not as comfortable and the shoe strings have trouble staying tied. I know of one other person who has similar shoe and he has trouble with the strings also. I would wish that previous quality was revived. By the end of the day I feel as if I can feel every thread in my shoe as well as the inner sole.
346827,1,"The shoes arrived quickly, size was correct and shoes were exactly what we needed! Price was lower than any of the local vendors! Thanks!"
242717,1,"I found these shoes to be very comfortable......and fun. For someone just learning to tap, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that may not fit well. These were perfect."
370862,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
132364,1,"Got these for my daughter's ballet class and they are great! Very well crafted, soft and comfortable. Follow the company's sizing chart and you shouldn't have problem ordering the right size."
202004,1,"Shoes are hard to wear at first as with all leather shoes. They need to be broken in.Comfortable and stylish with jeans or kackis very versatile. I am really satisfied with this shoe, and quality. Would recommend.Shoe tends to run true to size."
185615,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
281715,1,"Softsports provide comfort, style, and quality. Individuals can always be confident in buying softsport products, and are always a great value for the price."
37988,1,This shoe fits great and offers good support. I wore these a very long time before finally getting a new pair of Adidas. I used these for trail walking and they held up really well.
330530,1,"This is a very nice shoes and I had this so cheap,and it's so comfortable,good job by reebok."
162732,1,"This is at least the 6th pair of these shoes I have purchased. They are, hands down, the very best running shoe I have ever found. I am a low mileage(2-5 miles/run), and not fast (10 min/mile) runner. These shoes have the most cushion, the roomiest forefoot and the best comfort of any brand I've tried. For someone who likes good cushioning (my feet never hurt, ever, from running) and a wider forefoot (they are supremely comfortable), these are the shoes for you. Note, these shoes must run a bit small for the size; I order a size larger than my pumps. I don't like my toes to hit the front of the shoe while running. I highly recommend these shoes!"
385270,2,"When I received the sandal, the metal part was in bad conditions. With spot."
61588,1,I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner. I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen. I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these! And from this site. Just wish there was free shipping...
52118,1,"I always wanted a pair of Reef zories.... So, I was happy to find these affordable Seasides to meet the FREE Super Saver Shipping minimum purchase with the $10 Casio watch ordered. The Reefs were received promptly, but I was expecting them to be a bit thicker & more cushy. Also, 1/2 sizes weren't offered & I typically wear between sizes 6-7. Size 7 fit with plenty of toe space (stubby toes) & barely the right amount of heel space. Nevertheless, they were very comfy without having to break in & there is some arch support. I did feel potential blister action after I got them wet, but do find this purchase as a good value."
387128,1,"Dearfoam slippers I bought for my wife, are great. This is the 2nd pair she has had. She just loves them."
152555,1,Such a comfortable footbed! I now wear these or athletic shoes all the time and feet feel much better. I have ordered additional colors too!
136660,1,Converse's are classic. they are the shoes people are always going to wear. i like the high tops better though
104163,1,"I just purchased my 4th pair of these shoes. They are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn over the years, and they wear like iron with the following exception. The soles of the shoes cracked right through the instep. The first pair cracked well over 2 years after I purchased them, with the second pair cracking just over a year after purchase.I wish this company would get wise and revise the shoe sole so it wasn't prone to cracking. Had the last two pair re-soled at my local shoe repair and now use them for all manner of yard work. They are a great walking shoe, and nice enough looking to wear out for shopping and running errands.I do recommend them with the above caveat in mind. If you don't wear any one pair of shoes for a long time then it may not matter to you. Me, well I keep and wear my shoes forever, and by that I mean years so it is irk-some to have this happen to a shoe you love. However irk-some it is, I will continue to buy this shoe because their pluses far outweigh the negative and that negative can be corrected."
139684,1,"I used to buy Merrells for my waterproof winter shoes. The first pair I bought were great, but that was 8 yrs ago. They lasted 5 yrs. Then I bought a replacement pair that only lasted a year. I bought another pair (stupid me) and they lasted less than a year and were NEVER waterproof!These Keens were cheaper than the Merrells and feel great in wearing everyday. It is like wearing slippers all day long:) The true test will be how they hold up over time, but based on how they feel and appear, it is easily better than what I was buying in the past!"
323802,1,My husband has worn this style for years. I have never gotten them for such a great price though! Will definitely purchase here again!
359215,1,perfect fit and totally comfortable. Love the idea that I can wash them so use in the garden all the time.
310752,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
291495,1,"My son really loved these boots. They are comfortable, well stitched and he loves me extremely. Would'nt take them off!"
306133,2,"The material seems too shiny, almost like a patent leather shoe. Not to mention the shoes are ridiculously uncomfortable&#8211; I walked maybe a mile in them and had horrible blisters. Would not recommend."
107102,1,Sketchers have been the only shoes I have bought for years. They fit as though you have broken them in as soon as you get them and they last a long time. I really like these all white shoes. They look classy (as long as you keep them clean) and really pull outfits together. My only complaint would be that I can't figure out a way to get the tongue of the shoe to not scunch down. I have to keep pulling it up. I even ran the laces through the loop but that didn't help either. Maybe once I get them fully broken in.
27459,0,"This shoe is very stylish and is perfect with jeans. However, if you have flat feet it can cause foot and lower back pain because the shoe has a neutral gait and causes overpronation."
192668,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
5316,1,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was &#34;dated&#34; in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
13642,1,"These shoers were for my daughter. She loves them! As long as she is happy with them, I am happy with them. Adidas has done a great job with supplying kids shoes for athletics. That is the only kind of shoe, we as a family will wear. Keep up the great work Adidas!"
180339,1,"Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel"
383786,1,"I have lots and lots of problems wearing shoes. I find many women's shoes too constraining and tight, and have had various problems with my feet over the years that seem to just boggle the podiatrist. Putting me in orthotics seemed to make things much worse, as did just about any arch insert or other things inserted into the shoe. Most sneakers become almost unbearable to wear after several hours, and over time I've found that a light shoe with basic support worked best for me. I'd had good luck with some other easy spirit shoes so gave this one a try. And it is really amazing how comfortable this shoe is for me. It's so rare that a shoe fits and is comfortable without a serious break-in period, but this particular style just works that way for me, and I just hope they never discontinue it! I've tried a few other Easy Spirit shoes, even some walking shoes that look very similar but they just never seem to be as comfortable as this one. It definitely would not be the choice for someone who needs a lot of arch support and a really solid sidewall, but if you like very light shoes, this is an excellent one to try."
333545,1,"I purchased 5 pairs of shoes for my toddler, and I love them all! I was not previously familiar with the Little Laundry brand, but now I search for them because of their unique styles."
32170,1,"Retro is good - light weight, simple, not overstyled, and very comfortable. I'd buy more, but evidently they quit making them as I can't find any in my size and color choice. Too bad."
257705,1,This is a beautiful shoe and what a tremendous value! My only complaint is that there is not enough padding in the bottom of the shoe so I'll be buying some Dr. Scholl's inserts. I have trouble with my feet anyway so perhaps I'm being too picky. Highly recommend you buy this
220509,1,"These are perfectly comfortable, I have had these boots before, so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget. I wear a ladies 5.5-6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great!"
190868,1,"Purchased these for my stepdaughter who is taking dancing lessons, the price was very good and she says they are very comfortable. Run about 1/2 size smaller though."
45675,1,"I have a little wide foot, and these shoes are the best one in my life.I always put on this shoes 24 hours :) Thank you!"
257730,1,"Look sharp at the gym. Kind of squeeky when wet. I throw them in the washing machine to clean them. I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift ...j.g. Staten Island, NY"
7685,0,"I had read that Keds was going back to its original quality rubber sole, but these have the same thin flappy soles that Keds have had for the last few years. The upper is also somewhat thin and scratchy, not like the original quality. I won't be fooled again."
89976,0,"Absolutely love this style of shoe and this is my third pair. They did a quality change for SURE. I can barely slide my foot in it's so stiff. The sole seems to be a hard plastic feel instead of the soft kind before. And the shoe ""leather"" is stiff and looks cheaper. It is still comfortable to wear, once I can cram my foot in (practically needs a shoe horn). I hope I don't have the sole cracking problems others mention here. It's a shame, this used to be a 5 star shoe."
42322,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
359851,0,"Like most people have said, I'd suggest a half size up from your regular shoe size. I had bought character shoes from this company before, so I was pretty sure how they'd fit, but they changed the material they use for the top of the shoe since my first purchase. Now the black cover on the upper part of the shoe scuffs off VERY easily. I have only used mine for one show and there are already places where the top layer is rubbing off. I'm hoping that some black shoe polish or something like it will help."
60551,1,I've now had these boots for a month and they just continue to impress me. They were comfortable right out of the box so break in was very quick. I've worn them day hiking and have had no problems with hot spots.Even though they are waterproof I still recommend spraying them with silicone.5 Stars!
244706,1,I bought these socks for my husband. He has not stopped talking about how much he loves them. They are nice and warm. He wears them everyday when he relaxes.
154328,1,"Bought this ECCO product for work and casual wear. Retirement job at front desk of resort Inn requires being on my feet for 8 hour periods. Wore them right out of the box the day they were received. Great fit, light weight and comfortable. This is my first pair of ECCO shoes but my bride has worn several pairs over many years and always liked them. After my first week of wearing ECCO's I think I will be following her lead with additional ECCO purchases as shoes are needed."
41287,1,this is my second pair of reefs after finally deciding after 8 years that I should add a new pair. I love them!
177163,1,"the shoes were awesome quality, shipped very quickly, but i guess that style runs big, i usually wear an 11, ordered that. they were huge, had to send them back."
363182,1,"How can you go wrong with a pair of classic black Chuck Taylor's. Just keep in mind that the shoe sizes run BIGGER. I wear and 11 and ordered a pair of 11s. A whole size to big for me. I don't mind returning, but just keep that in mind."
300084,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
360592,1,My friends call them my &#34;40s shoes&#34; and I get compliments on them all the time at work which is pretty much the only place I wear them. They are sturdy and comfortable but I had to add no-skids to them to keep from slipping on the hardwood floors. Even on stage I used to have to do that. I wish they made these for everyday wear like with a real heel cover and weatherproof bottom sole but hey - these arent for wearing around town after all. Still I love em and think theyre great! I also have them in black.
325155,1,"It's good to have a company with experience in sports, this style will stick, it's just great for those who are demanding in soccer. I personally, are my first pair, but have met my expectations. Zuela a fantastic, durable and suitable for any soccer field. The only problem that you do not at the front where the rivets will over time tend to break away a bit, which in the winter makes it adiera land and move off. but, considering the use that I gave in almost 5 months, have responded. I have used on average 4 times per week. recommend"
227821,1,"I LOVE CHUCKS. Have them in many colors and styles! Have been buying them for years, and know what to expect. Sizing differences can be handled if you pick one size, usually one half a shoe size for tie ups, and one shoe size for slip ons."

34978,0,I love the way these shoes look and everyone tells me how comfortable they are. I bought mine 2 years ago and have trouble wearing them; after a short period of walking I get a aching pain in my arch. I have other Danskos that were stiff at first but are now wonderful. Perhaps it's my flat feet? Does anyone have any suggestions?
167686,1,This is the second pair I have bought and they are so very comfortable for walking all day long!!The price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I have looked.Highly recommend!!
124058,1,"I have pink & black Patti Suede/Shearling Scuff Slippers. The soft shearling linings are soft, fluffy, & comfortable. The high quality suede with shearling trim is durable & beautiful. The slippers hold their shape with heavy use, and the sturdy & comfortable heel does not collapse. You will not find a real shearling slipper that is as good looking. It is not bulky and boxy as many other real shearling slippers are, and the Pattis are offered at a reasonable price. Sizes are true."
137261,1,"I got these shoes for my boyfriend, and there was absolutely NO other place that had these in his size!! I ordered them, and they came in WAY earlier than I expected! Even earlier than the shipping expectancy! Ill buy Chucks from here for now on!"
224308,1,"What can be said about a pair of canvas tennis shoes ?They fit, the laces tie, I wear them."
256404,1,"Love them, when going out with my kids, terrific slippers. They are SO EASY to clean and dry. Very comfortable and resistant. Went to the Igua&uacute; Waterfalls in the Brazilian/Argentinian border and used them all the time in my walks at the park.What a breakthrough invention in materials!! This crocs are a must for everyone who needs some cheap, comfortable and all purpose sandals/shoes."
212440,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for casual wear with my jeans when I did not want to wear my regular walking shoes. They are cute, stylish and comfortable for everyday wear, not recommended for heavy walking."
245826,1,"These shoes are comfortable, sturdy, good looking and fairly priced. I've been wearing them for years, and always buy the same model (in both black and brown) when the old ones finally wear out."
273414,1,"Super comfortable!Very spacious shoes. I tend to agree with the size down (about 1/2). My own feet are on the wide side, so...The only thing is despite of the open heels, they are really too warm to wear in the summer time."
324170,1,"Overall, I think this was a good purchase. I agree with past warnings about the flimsy straps (they do not stand up like the older models from a few years ago)- but when balanced with the price- I'll live with the straps. I appreciated the service from Midwest Sports and would use them again."
213868,1,This shoe is one of comfort and style. It is like walking on air.The shoe is a perfect fit and NO PAIN ANYWHERE regardless of how long I wear them.I would highly recommend this pair of shoes.

162612,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
58784,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."
220044,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
102485,1,"great workout shoe. I have a pair I still use, Skecher Sport, and they were a size 10 and fit great. I ordered this pair as a size 10 and they are a bit larger but not so much to send it back."
166894,2,"What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product? I would have wanted to know if they didn't have the color they showed in the picture, which was Burgundy. If I had known that I would have never ordered it. I am a female and I don't want a black timberland boot. The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady. I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want. I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture, but it didn't work out. You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around. I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible."
279442,1,These arrived much faster than they said they would. Because they are a gift I was pleased by the early arrival.They are exactly what I was looking for.
265495,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"

153800,1,These original Uggs boots are simply the best and very much worth the few extra dollars!
83169,1,"These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable flip flops I've ever worn (I collect flip flops-my collection has over 20). They have amazing arch support, and tends to run a tad bit skinny on the straps, so if your feet are a little wider, you may want to size up."
226746,1,"I haven't worn converse for years! I forgot how wonderful they felt and how much fun it is to wear them. I'm a stay at home mom and want to get ""dressed to shoes"" every morning in some lace up shoes. I don't really like the look of white athletic type shoes unless I'm exercising. I love my new converse shoes!"
66707,1,"I tried on a bunch of different brands of shoes, trying to find the most comfortable. I usually wear New Balance, but thought I would see if there is anything more comfy out there. I fell in love with a pair of Asics. Before buying, I decided to go to a shoe store and tried on several different pairs of Asics: GT-2120, GT-1120, GT 2110, and some others. Even thought the GT-2110's are not the newest on the market, they were by far the most comfortable for me! I love the cushioning! There was no ""breaking them in"" either. They have been comfortable since the first time I used them. I don't run alot, but I take a lot of exercise classes and these are perfect. I don't think I will ever buy another brand of shoes. I highly recommend them."
101874,1,"So I read many of the reviews here that cover the sizing confusion. I ordered a size too large and well, they are a size too large! I am now ordering a second pair so that my daughter will have well fitting ballet shoes in time for class on Monday. Moral of the story, sometimes it helps to read reviews and sometimes it does not.These are well made shoes, good quality leather. I like Capezio products, these are almost identical to the ballet shoes I wore as a child about 30 years ago when I started ballet at age 5. Nice to see that some things never change and the quality is still important to the people at Capezio. Thanks!"
94258,1,THIS IS MY 4TH PURCHASE OF THIS SHOE STYLE. USUALLY THERE IS A NEW SHOE BREAK IN PERIOD BUT WITH THIS SHOE IT'S COMFORTABLE FROM THE FIRST WEARING UP TO THE FINAL WEARING. I'M SURE I'VE PUT MORE THAN THE 1000 MILE GUARANTEE ON EACH OF THE PREVIOUS PAIRS BUT I LIKE THAT THERE IS A WARRANTY ON THE SHOES. AND THE PRICE IS GREAT TOO!
184334,1,"I love these shoes. I had a pair of cheap moccasins I had to keep repairing until I finally decide to just replace them. I am so glad I did. I like the rubber sole, and the shoe material seems to be great quality. I usually wear an 8, sometimes 7.5 and had to get a 7. They stretch quite a bit, and fit great with or without socks. These are my everyday shoes."
356974,1,"These cute, white Keds are perfect with so many outfits. Their slender sillouette adds a feminine touch to jeans, shorts, capris and summer skirts. They are comfortable for walking around town and give a much simpler profile than most sneakers these days."
76471,0,Extremely uncomfy and made of cheap plastic-like material but what more can you expect for the price. Other than that they're pretty sexy.
3228,1,"We bought these for my husband. He has a rough time with shoes of any kind. These needed some time to be broke in but beyond that are very good. Good price - good value for the money, we think."
148810,2,"I like Vaneli styles, and I own other shoes from this company, but these were unusually cheap. They were unlined! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet, and they are lined. The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining. In addition, the heel plates are cheap, hard plastic. My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off. My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges. FootSmart charged me $12.99 to ship the shoes, and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction, they are charging me $6.99 more using the barcode return label. Thus I spent $20 to try on cheap shoes. I don't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore, and I won't order from FootSmart. Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero ([...]!)."
223024,1,"I'm so glad that I discovered these shoes! I have them in every color and wear them most of the time. I travel a lot and I can walk all day in these shoes without pain. I especially like the idea of the velcro straps everywhere so that if your feet swell from sitting too long, you can let them loose a little while. They don't take up lots of room in your luggage. You can be dressed up or dressed down. I've worn them to the beach and also for evening wear with a long skirt. Treat yourself and buy a pair of these wonderful shoes! Order your regular size as they are true to fit. Ignore the person who compared these to Clark's. These are better."
361589,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
63533,1,"This is my second pair of Hi-Tec boots and I love them! I was volunteering in Haiti for several months in 2010 and wore out my shoes so a volunteer brought me down this pair of boots. I have used them walking up and down riverbeds in Haiti, through rubble piles, around city streets, etc. for more than half of the past 21 months and they are still holding up! I am very pleased with them and will buy another pair whenever I wear these out!"
326658,0,"I bought these for my wedding, as I wanted something comfortable and cute. They have a nice arch support, but the sole is not as cushy as other styles of Reefs. The thong part between your toes is made up of the two fabric sides sewn together instead of a ribbon that's folded inward (as with other styles), so the seam can rub wrong if you have sensitive toes. Overall, though, they are still more comfortable, stylish, and well-crafted than cheaper flip-flops."
75726,2,"Military shirt stays must be used by people that are taller than 5' but shorter than 6'2. These shirt stays are capable of winning the war for the enemy. When the packaging was made up for the product did anyone actually look at what the military actually needed or did they they try to sell the military something else that they did not need? In a field modification I will change a few things on these military shirt stays and hope that I don't hurt myself. Unfortunately I don't have many options for a refund since I need them for July 8. Eureka, the manufacturer hates our military and is intent on selling them equipment that could get our service members injured."
78579,1,The Chuck Taylor converse I ordered from AMAZON meet all my expectations.It is comfortable on my feet and i wear it everyday.
15102,1,"I love these shoes! In fact, I saw them at Nordstrom's the other days and they were over $60. I got them for under $30 on Amazon, but coupons - what a deal!!"
181177,1,I looked at alot of sites for this shoe. This was best price. It fits true to size and is very comfortable. Great looking too; have gotten alot of compliments on them.
4435,1,"Bought these for my husband so this review is from him. He has purchased these boots before and wanted another pair because he was so pleased. He wears standard width size 15 boots. These Hi-Tec boots truly are waterproof. His feet have never gotten wet while wearing them. The tread holds well on all kinds of terrains. He leads photo workshops in Yosemite National Park so he needs great hiking boots -- and these work well for him. The first pair lasted years, can't remember when he bought them. We expect just as great a performance from this pair."
135784,1,"I used to have a pair of Chuck Taylor's as a kid (and that was a while ago) as great cheap knock around shoes. Price has gone up a fair bit, but these monochrome shoes look great; classic styling, updated a bit.One small caveat; these shoes have little internal padding and have a lot more room inside than normal software in the same size. The retailer I purchased from mentioned they are about a 1/2 size larger than other shoes."
283597,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
62437,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
164851,0,shoe looks great but they run 1/2 to 1 size smaller than a running shoe.
211688,1,These are the most comfortable shoes if you are on your feet all day. They look good and fit so well.
319854,1,My husband and I both LOVE these shoes. We have worn them over the years and keep coming back to them. They are SO comfortable and go with everything - a great pair of shoes :0).PS - I am not unhappy - I was unhappy with a product and could not change my name - he ha - not too computer sauve.
256259,1,Adorable!! I have always loved Kswiss tennis shoes! They fit well and are easy to clean. I received them very quickly. A no hassle purchase.
81224,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
342474,1,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. They are great to wear to work and great to walk in. I am buying more shoes from Grasshoppers, forget Rockport and Easy Spirit."
225704,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
95904,1,"I have been buying Enzo Angolini's Liberty flats since the late 80's/early 90's. These are my favorite flats to wear with just about anything!! Not only does the style go with so many outfits, it's exceptionally comfortable. I have many (MANY) shoes and these are the only ones I wear often enough to wear out. I'm so happy to find that Amazon is selling this shoe---making it much easier to purchase!!"
28834,1,It's the first time that I buy something over amazon and I have to say I am very impressed with the service and the quality of the product.
178676,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
282940,2,"I, too, had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe. The new shoe was not as comfortable at first, but after time has become more comfortable. After just over a year, I, too, have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers. The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes. This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear."
173893,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
221959,1,"I was tired of the slippers that were comfortable, but had no solid bottom to walk around on.I have found them at last!The box made me smile, it had all the skin types and has the one you ordered checked. I thought that was thoughtful.They are warm, cozy, and you can walk around inside or outside without worry! It is a hard enough rubber sole to make it a shoe, but comfortable enough for a slipper."
277479,1,"This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
125099,1,I have worn this Softspots Stephanie shoe for many years in various colors. They are comfortable and can be worn with different styles of clothing.
94020,0,"My wife did not like this shoe, mainly the look and feel of the shoe. She returned them and got her money back."
348467,2,"Like many people writing reviews of ECCO shoes, I have been a fan of theirs for 20 years, if not more. Sorry to say that in the last few years, I have experienced quality issues with ECCO, primarily with the sole and occasionally, fit. My experience has not been as dramatic as some here, where the sole suddenly disintegrates or performs a disappearing act in the closet after one month of wear. Rather, I noticed that within six months of purchase the soles of my shoes and boots showed grey-black dots, about the size of a pencil eraser. At first I thought I had stepped in something inky, but upon closer examination I realized that the dots were actually holes in the sole, disintegrating from within. The dark spot was merely the outside skin of the sole had not (yet) disintegrated. Of course that inevitably wore off or fell off, and I was left with two pairs of boots and two pairs of Track II shoes in various stages of sole disintegration. I should say that not all of my shoes were in equal disrepair. One just had a few ""dots"". But the boots were a disaster. Moreover, I also noticed that the seam between the sole and shoe had started to crack and come apart on one of the Track II shoes -- alarming. I had several pairs repaired via the mail in service (Nushoe) but those soles wear out as any other type of sole, so I felt that I had not enjoyed the durability that ECCO once promised, in exchange for premium pricing. I am very hesitant now about purchasing ECCO, and feel disappointed that I must say that."
354100,1,"I got this boot not expecting much but wow, I was wrong. These things are very light, can take a pounding, and look great too. The insulation (200g) is really not enough to keep you too warm but on the otherside, it does not make your foot sweat either! If you are thinking about buying these or timberlands Pit Boss version, get these. They are leaps and bounds ahead of the pit boss."
373996,1,"They must be right since I'm into my second pair. I have a small goat dairy in NE US and the Jungle Moc's have proven themselves as my Summer work shoe...for the most part. First pair lasted close to three years with steady, fairly rough, occasionally muddy challenges. Mainly like them because they're easy to slip on, have a secure feeling fit, are just right for my EE foot, and a good grip on our variegated terrain. It would be great if a very similar but ankle high boot existed for winter use, perhaps water proof, and zip up (one that works)."
45976,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
213923,1,"my daughter wear these shoes over a year, and they resist and are in perfect shape. I would buy them again if weren't out of stock."
364941,1,"I would wear Converse every day if I could - they are sooooo comfortable! They run big, which is good because it helps offset the fact that they are also a bit on the narrow side. But my wide feet have no problem with them. They come in a great variety of colors and patterns, and I have quite a few of them, both hi-tops and low-tops. I love 'em all... and would buy more if I had the money! Speaking of which, that's the one downside to Converse - the cost. You pay for the name. But you can always watch for a good sale..."
386403,1,"I have a wide foot and struggle to find stylish sneakers I can wear. These fit the bill. I got the grey ones...they were a little snug when I first put them on, but two nights of wearing them untied around the house broke them in enough. I got them on Wednesday and by Friday I could comfortably tie them and walk around like they were my favorite old kicks.My only complaint is that most of the ""fun"" colors aren't available in wide. C'mon, New Balance. Give the fat footed what we want!"
68088,1,Fat Baby boots have a nice roomy wide toe box for those who need extra comfort.This is the 7th pair I have bought and the only brand I can wear. I can wearthem all day their so comfy.
340297,2,"My son wore these off and on for a month when school started. Both shoes, the soles started to come off. The right one came off almost completely. Don't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I wouldn't order these particular Converse shoes again."
296784,1,Great shoe to wear. Only comes in medium width so I had to bring to a shoemaker to expand the width. Had a pair 20 years ago. The old ones were made in England. The new ones are made in Vietam.
270513,1,"The merchandise arrived exactly as presented in the ad. I am very pleased with the product, and the delivery time was excellent!!"
157482,1,"I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $20. I've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere. I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test. I've worn them in Iraq, Kuwait, Arizona, Florida, Washington. they are a part of me. Truly an epic shoe. They're also a great driving shoe, with a nice rolled heel after some wear, and great pedal feel. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around, everyday shoe."
152900,1,The shoes walk like heaven shoes. The product itself is really good. The shipment only took forever.
258287,1,"Cute, pratical and STRONG. Don't get the imitations; pay more for the brand name which is far better. I've had 2 pairs for about a year and the mj's are fantastic--a great alternative to flip flops, beach, and for casual parties."
334152,1,"Hands down Clarks Original Wallabees are the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn!, I first started wearing them in the early 1980's and i have been buying them ever since, i have always bought the Wallabee boot (sand color) because they just seem to go with any outfit, my feet never get sore from walking because the crape rubber soles are so amazingly cushioned, you can literally walk all day in these shoes because they feel so great!, i would recommend Clarks Original Wallabees to anyone!, as styles come and go it's amazing that these shoes look the same today as they did waaaaaaay back when i was in highschool (30+ years ago), they really ARE timeless!, why change perfection!!!!! (:->)"
180644,1,"[[ASIN:B000FAI9X0 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top red high top tennis shoes.They were just what the kid wanted, and they fit. He has been wearing them daily. Great!Vazel"
135468,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
38314,2,"IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR. I DID SO AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM/"
25451,0,"I have used these boots everyday for about a year, and put them through the paces for sure. I Have owned many pairs of hiking boots in this price range.So we'll start with those perty green laces, throw them out as soon as you get them. They wont keep tied, and will very quickly break. I think mine lasted almost a month, and during that time I would have to be constantly reminded that my shoes were untied...they were an annoyance to say the least, complete garbage if you really want to know. The cuff on the ankle is about a half inch too low and does not fully support the ankle. The leather is 1 piece, and have kept my feet very dry. The leather is also too soft, they again don't give any ankle support. I work a job that requires I have 100lbs+ on my back in remote mountain locations. These boots will offer NO support for sprains.The plus side is that they break-in almost immediatly, week-week and a half, and they wont cause blisters during that time. The boot is also very comfortable. The Goretex lining really helps with drying the boot after tromping through mud and swampy trails. The eyelits and hooks are very burly. ALL of my other boots have had the eyelits pop out, leaving pencil diamater holes in them. The sole is good, I walk up wet slippery bedrock without any concern. They still have about 25% tread left.So here's the deal, If you are planning on wearing these boots every once and a while and only taking day hikes with small weight on your back, If your into ""urban"" fashion then these boots will be fine. But If you require a little more ankle protection, If you want a boot that will last, I have to reccommend you buy LIMMER boots. They are made in the US, they have an unlimited lifetime warranty I.E will literally last forever, and they cost about the same. The down side is that they are much stiffer, meaning you have to suffer a very brutal break-in period, and they have to be worn fairly regulary to maintain that break-in. So if you think these boots have a tough break in two suggestions don't buy this boot, and grow a pair, Danners are practiclly slippers.I also have a big concern with the Danner Website who directly controls what reviews are posted and ultimatly seen by their prospective buyers. Meaning that they don't want people to know the actual quality of their boot, they just want people to buy them. I feel duped into buying these after having read all of the glowing reviews on their site. These boots are NOT as good as you might imagine from reading the reviews, don't be fooled. Today I went to post on their review page and my review was rejected. It was a 3 star review! Very disapointed with the company's attitude towards its customers."
216030,1,"love these boots. the tread design is well placed, and very functional. the heel doesnt rub my ankle wrong. i like the material as it allows for a good touch."
244979,0,Just exactly what we needed. These work fine for a girl or boy. Perfect with her uniform and she loves them
157349,1,I have a finished basement than can get pretty cold so I went to look for something that was good and affordable. I got it in these slippers . The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is that the small pulling tab at back of one slipper ripped off the 2nd time I put them on. No biggie though.
50667,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
181336,1,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
331078,1,"These are a bit clunky, but look great with jeans and heavier pants. I really like the look, but they are not as comfy as something lighter-weight might be. I will certainly continue to enjoy them for at least another season...make me feel like Johnny Depp! LOve that!"
233224,1,"and e ep nice color, nice designe, nice adroit . . . this is your shoes, when you dress on ipath, you cannt stay one place, mooovee your......................!!!"
167121,1,"The most comfortable walking shoe ever. Accommodates my small, wide feet with socks. Great for errands about town or sightseeing. I have these in a number of colors and hope they never stop making them."
209984,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
128803,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
100546,1,"I've been wearing Birkenstocks since 1996 and have bought 53 pairs to date. I have them in different styles: sandals, clogs, thongs, dressy flats, casual flats, and even an athletic shoe style. Initially when I bought my first pair it took a week to break them in. I'd wear them for a couple of hours per day until they started molding to my insole. I guess I have adapted to Birkenstock's cork footbed as I no longer really need to break them in.The Florida is one of my favorite styles as it has a more feminine profile. The three bands secure the sandal to the foot; no problems with slippage as these babies stay put. They are designed so your toes grip the toe bed. They conform to my feet and offer a lot of support as well as comfort. The best way I can describe it is that the shoes mold to one's feet through a combination of weight/pressure as well as body heat. Rather than trying to adapt your feet to a pair of shoes Birkenstocks do the opposite because they adapt to the wearer.If you flex each shoe 2-3 times before initially wearing it seems to make the shoes seem less rigid. Once the shoe starts to mold to the foot, the insole will darken and have an imprint of your foot on the sole. The Birkibuk upper is a synthetic material which mimics nubuck and is easy to clean if necessary and is stain resistant. In the past I've treated the upper with Camp Dry, but it isn't really necessary.These sandals are great if you are o.k. with a somewhat hard sole and willing to give them the appropriate time to break them in. They've helped with my posture, I pronate far less, and I'm so used to wearing them that I forget I have them on."
131140,1,TINGLEY RUBBER #1300XL XL BLK Rubber OvershoeWears well over many years for dress or outdoor wear
25751,1,My son is very happy with this shoe! Very comfortable for getting around campus. The style seems to work with any casual wear.
161554,1,"I have been a fan of Converse since the day I saw Will Smith unpack a brand new pair in the movie iRobot. I wanted one for myself, where else amazon is the best place to buy. The Product price is very affordable except the shipping and handling costs. They are a bit high to Sri Lanka. Would be great if they are low too."
106412,1,"I bought these for my husband at a highly discounted price here at amazon, around december'08. At first, he was very scheptical about the color, and wasn't sure who to wear them. Finally last weekend I chose an outfit for him to go to a work meeting including the shoes and he absolutely loved it. He has a heel spur which makes it very unconfortable to walk after a couple of hours, but he was so satisfied with this pair, that he now wants me to get all his shoes just like this one. After he showed how great this shoes were, I'm willing to pay full price for all the following pairs, but with the discount I bought these, it was just the perfect buy.Even though they're a little dressy, they go great with jeans for a more ""informal"" look. Two thumbs up, KC, keep em coming."
295683,1,"these are wonderful boots! they arecomfortable, just the right height ofheel. i have small calves and theyfit beautifully"
69448,1,"I love my crocs. I have three pairs and wear them everywhere. They are very, very good for my feet. Other people have told me that they make their feet sweat, but for me they are perfect. The thick sole and the spring are wonderful. And ... if they get dirty, just wash them under the tap. Somebody asked me one time: ""Do you think I would look ridiculous if I wore those?"" and I answered: ""not anymore ridiculous than I look"" but really, I don't care. Comfort is everything. I have noticed that all the nurses and medical personnel in hospitals wear them, even doctors. They are on their feet all day long so that should mean something. As I said above: they are life savers."
303273,1,I had a pair of these for years and they finally fell apart. Couldn't believe I found the exact match and just as comfy!
249927,2,"I loved the shoe itself, i.e., the quality of its production and the colors, and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past, but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself, then this will not really apply to you, and you should read another review."
253229,1,"I really like these boots, even though I got the Tapue Suede it does not look as brown as in the picture, it's more of a light brown color. I ordered a half size down which everyone recommended and it's still a bit loose, but it's okay!The shoes over all are very comfortable, I had to do a double take when I opened the box since I thought it was fake since the soles were made of this almost gel like texture since I thought it was cork. I checked the website and instores and confirmed it is how it is suppose to be.They are a bit weird if you wear with socks since it pulls it down a bit. Great purchase, great price. I would buy again."
188042,1,"I got them for my slippers, and now use them in my boots, too. VERY thick (might be too thick for some boots), and VERY warm!"
100028,1,These Sperry Top Siders are just like the pair I got her eleven years ago. The only difference is that this pair cost less than those. Same quality and at a lower price. I could not find them anywhere at a lower price. Very fast delivery. Completely happy with this purchase from Amazon
276285,1,almost like my last pair that lasted 7 years just a little taller. Rugged holds up well to everyday wear almost the only thing I wear year round.
348731,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
345679,1,Customer Service was quick to reply as well as very helpful. The item arrived fast and in perfect condition. Excellent service.
293035,1,My Dr.Martens are well-made and comfortable. which fit perfectly.I like wearing my new boots so much that I wear them at night when I am in my pajamas.
187329,1,"I was contemplating in whether or not to get the Uggs or the EMUs. I am glad I went with the Uggs. They continue to keep my feet warm and I have not taken them off since I bought them! I would recommend ordering a 1/2 size down.When I first bought them they were a bit snug, now they have stretched out a big and fit perfect!"
48780,1,"Here we have what must be an old clique - the letter carrier with problem feet. I've had weak ankles and rather serious pronation for years. Physical therapists recommended the Brooks Beast and it works for me - very well. Great arch and ankle support. As for price, I compared and this time Amazon was the best. I buy two pair at a time so I can alternate shoes every day in the hope of extending their life in the rather stressful conditions I put them through. A good bet all around."
323071,1,+ Sturdy+ fairly light+ Durable+ perfect for summers+ decent priceI own 2 pairs: love em both!
143428,1,"These shoes are really cute and mostly comfortable. A little rough place near one toe rubbed for a while, but isn't a problem now. The sole seems narrower than the shoe itself, so it presesnts a lean profile. I walk in these for fitness, and the vents provide good circulation, but there's lots of plastic in the top, so some folks might find them hot to wear. The fit is true to size. I have liked other Skechers better than these, but still will buy Skechers."
147628,1,"I fell in love with my Uggs the moment I slipped them onto my feet for the very first time. They are wonderfully comfortable & very warm. No, your feet won't sweat in warm weather, I promise. Most comfortable fit shoe of my life. I wear them at least 6 days a week! **Be sure to order a size down from your normal shoe size. I'm normally a 6, but I bought a 5.** Wear these withOUT socks and they feel like heaven. Wearing them with socks is bulky & well, they weren't meant for sock wearing. Cave in & buy them, it'll be the best $139 you've ever spent!!! Stuck on what color to get? Black turns your feet black. The dark tan is hard to match things with. The sand is perfect for everything!! Put them under your pants, or over.. they go perfect with any day's outfit or weather :)"
327992,1,love these sandals will purchase again. Dressy enough but comfortable for all the time. Just a real cute summer sandal.
270266,1,"For the money, these are very comfortable shoes... I have narrow feet (C width) so the Medium width shoes fit great! They hold up well too, mine typically last almost 2 years wearing them every day to work."
269512,1,"I have been buying this model shoe sense 1995. Once my local shoe stores stop carrying them I had to find another source, which have been online shoe stores. I have never found any quality problems with the dozen or more pairs I have owned. I have never even bought a shoe lace. I wear these shoes 10 hours a day 5 to 7 days a week for work and get about 1 years of use out of them. I believe these are worth the money spent."
382714,1,These are the most comfortable flip flops. The top is fabric so it's not irritating and the bottom is thicker than your average so your feet are cushioned when you walk outside. I had an old pair that lasted over 10 years. Love these.
34144,1,"I got these for my 93 year old mother who still walks for exercise. She has an extremely hard to find shoe size (8 AAAA) and this is almost the only shoe made in that size any more so we are lucky to be able to buy it for her. She has these in several colors and finds them comfortable to wear every day, all day."
192770,1,"Great shoes! I always get Tevas for my 3 years old daughter. This particular one have extra sponge on the back. They look great with the jeans as well as with the dress. Thank you. Also, the price was so low, I think it was $25. They are comfortble too."
219673,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
159806,1,"Mono-Black Chucks are amazing utility shoes. I wear mine when:* working (with tie)* sledding* partying* hiking* gardening* attending black tie formal events (yes really)Ironically, the thing Chucks are bad for is the shoe's original intended purpose: athletics & sports."
214892,1,"Hey, I won't lie. I like hip shoes. However, my feet don't have the best arches. And while these shoes look like your average hipster lowtops, they provide much more support, arch, and comfort that something like an adidas shell-toe or Converses.I've got a pair of black-reds, and received complements on them.Just bought a pair of ""elephant"" colored ones, and they fit great.I was suprised to see that there are far more colors available here than at the Puma store on Market St. in San Francisco."
805,1,"This is my third pair. The first finally wore out after 5 years of use in the yard and all around durring the winter and my second is reserved for just hiking, (they took me over the Indian Himilayas very nicely, thank you.)Light weight, inexpensive, and a good fit. I can recomend them. Oh Yea they truly are water proof till about 5 years old."
193709,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
7228,1,"Love these shoes, they tick all the boxes. I get a couple of pairs a year. Please don't drop this style."
125444,1,"These sandals are very comfortable and I am very pleased with this purchase. Shipping was speedy. I do feel, however, that the size ran a little small."
130943,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
38996,1,"I bought my puma's on amazon like 4 years ago, before everyone else started wearing them. I can't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro, and springs that look like space boots. If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas. They have tons of cool colors and you can't go wrong with black. Who doesn't love these."
160811,1,I like this product because it was not used.Good product and cheaper than the official site.that is it
196021,1,"I love that Crocs have finally released a fashionably practical shoe that actually feels better on my feet then sneakers. I moved wearing crocs modi flip the first weekend, then sneakers the next weekend. Switched back to crocs when unpacking around the house. The pain in my back felt an immediate release once changing footwear. Wish my fiance wore sandles ;-)"

121953,1,This shoe holds up well under my 210 pound frame. The shoe also supports my orthotics well and fits perfectly (I am actually about a size 12 1/2). I still think this is the best heavy duty shoe for the money.
284091,1,"The Beast is the best shoe for me. Being heavier than most heavy runners (260 pounds), the support and cushioning is very important. I've been running in the Beast shoes for several years now and haven't had any problems. These shoes arrived on time and were the correct size and color."
185739,2,"I returned these shoes. They were way too long in the toe and the heel slipped in my regular size. Not what I expected, but they are a nice looking shoe."
20582,1,"I have been a purchaser of Cole Haan shoes for a long time. I've always believed good footwear is very important if you're on your feet all day. I have friends who buy cheap shoes and always complain how their feet hurt. I am extremely tough on footwear because of my size. I'm 6'5"", weigh 215 lbs and have a very high arch in my foot. I like all leather shoes because they will last a long time with proper care and they can be resoled. Cole Haan shoes are always true to size and this style can be worn with Dockers, dress slacks, a suit and jeans. I'm giving them 4 stars only because they took much longer to break in than other Cole Haan shoes I've owned. Once they loosened up, they are extremely comfortable and look good all the time."
221975,1,Worth every penny. Name brand says it all. I use it on a weekly basis playing in all types of weather and seasons. It's tough yet comfortable.Highly recommend it.
37957,1,These shoes are awesome. They make my legs feel so good. There was not a break in time. Just felt great from out of the box. I recommend these to all who want an extra little something when doing your walking.
8831,0,"Especially on tan, summer legs.My girl wears these if we go to lunch or dinner where she can SIT for the while.They are not especially comfortable, but they are irresistible until I take them off her. That's sexy too !"
5355,1,"I dont think I would recommend these for sports but they are great for just walking. I work in the city and have to dress up but weather permitting, I always walk from my car or train to the office in these, and then change to my formal shoes. Going home, I do the reverse. I find them very comfortable and they hold up well. I highly recommend them for these types of activities but they dont have enough tread for sports."
326942,1,These are not only comfy but stylish! I have had many pairs of Reefs over the years. They are long lasting and the only flip flops I will buy. They cost a bit more but are worth it. Reefs are well made and form to your feet over time. You will not be disappointed.
55706,1,"very cheap for Keds, fits excellent, got it really fast in two days, i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything. Totally worth it:)"
75004,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
304902,1,"First let me say that my order was delivered to me in no time. I acutally had to return and order a size down, and received my new order in a couple of days. These boots are very very warm and comfortable. They are great for the snow and ice. They have great grippers on the bottom to help prevent you from falling. I've ordered two pair for below the price of one seen on other website. Very happy with my purchase."
180672,0,"Timeless look, whether you're a prep or a punk, anyone can pull off wearing a pair of chucks. Not good for athletic performance, it shocks me to realize they were created for basketball use. Ouch! Also, due to their lack of traction and feeble soles, it's easy to burn through a pair in a matter of months if they're your regular shoe. That makes them not worth the $40 price tag Converse is offering them for. If they were $20-25, maybe. I recommend this shoe for people more concerned with style than comfort."
311821,1,"This isn't a review but just a message on the off chance that anyone representing Corcoran reads it.I live in the UK and it is virtually impossible to get these boots online in Europe. The ones I've finally managed to find cost an absolute fortune (185) which I'm still going to pay as I may not get another chance to buy any -since these ones will no doubt quickly sell out.There must be a huge potential market in the UK and Europe just from armed forces personel alone, such is the reputation of Corcoran over here. So for what it's worth, please for the love of god try and make Corcoran boots available on Amazon to the European market -I beg you!Regards, Liam."
236117,0,"Great look, comfortable, enough isolation... I was satisfied till I started walking, cause one of the boots had a leak, making a noise everytime I was standing on that foot. I simply decided to return the boots, for an exchange, but never heard of my boots since that. They gave me my money back (OK), but that wasn't what we agree when I wrote to the custumer service. After 3 months (hunting season kind of ending soon)I decided to look somewhere else. Oh and I had to pay custom fees for something I didn't have. Not a great experience for me..."
279063,1,"Minnetonka Moccasins are my favorite shoes. I buy the plain tan ones. For me, they can be worn with everything. They are so soft, it is like walking bare foot, and the soles are slip proof! :)Minnetonka Women's Deerskin Gore Front Crepe Sole Moccasins,Mocha Deerskin,11 M USMinnetonka Women's Deerskin Gore Front Crepe Sole Moccasins,Mocha Deerskin,11 M US"
316094,1,"Nice boots, very well made. Immediately took out the insert that looks like a pleated tassel but otherwise these will last way after I get tired of lacing them up all of the time."
73954,1,"Just what i want it and my 19month baby girl just love them, she has chubby feet so this is so comfy and perfect, now she can get her shoes wet or dirty and no worries."
377170,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
124127,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
362989,1,Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse.
46785,1,"Beautiful quality shoes, perfect packaging. The size ran a little big but that is no big deal. Highly recommended."
250609,1,"nice looking shoes for a very low price , very smooth and the blue is intense"
131550,1,I love these flip flops but they run a size small than I wear so I had to reorder a bigger size. But they are very comfortable. I would like to get them in every color they have.
215345,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
359583,1,"A friend recommend these shoes to me. I have hardly worn any other shoes since I got them. The real test was today at the beach. Sand just slides right through, yet enough support and grip to climb around on the rocks. I'll buy more!"
312040,1,"I bought the shoes about 6 months ago and they still look nice. Even though your not supposed to get them wet, I have worn them in the rain and you cant even tell."
107037,1,These shoes are nice except I got the wheat colored ones they have that work boot look\color but are also very stlish I got the wheat colored ones because I had a white and they got dirty when I stepped in a mud puddle. the shoes have nice padding and match with pretty much anything. It is better to get these from amazon.com because I got mine at kohls and would have had to pay 60 bucks but luckily they were on sale for 43 bucks
99101,1,I bought these as a gift for my son. The sizing was spot on. He loves them. They are apparently very popular nowadays!
40299,0,"The sandals are cushy enough and seem sturdy, but the straps get twisted every time I put them on and if I don't take the time to straighten them out it makes it uncomfortable to walk. I've never had this problem with a pair of flip flops. Maybe the straps are too thin."
332737,0,"The crocs are okay it's the seller that is not okay! The crocs broke second day of vacation. I wrote the seller. The seller told me they would send extra clips whioh was fine but if these broke, I would have to contact the factory. They (the seller) DO NOT stand by the products they sell. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! ELECTRIKID - not sure of the exact spelling."
30138,1,"I have been a huge fan of the 760 series, starting with the 762, and all the way up. These are the best yet. Perfect support, and extreme comfort. They work with you to get great workouts. Buy them while they still have your size!"
181921,0,I purchased these shoes because I have a hard time finding my size 5. I have purchased these before through another place and they seemed to be more comfortable and softer inside. I can only wear these for a short time before my feet start to hurt and I have to remove them.
102477,1,"These arrived today and are well made and very comfortable. One caveat however is that the sole of the sneakers are very stiff. If you plan to walk on slippery surfaces this may be an issue for you. Overall though I like them but keep in mind to take care not to slip when walking on slick stairs, etc."
40427,0,"I recently bought these shoes and the similarly designed 'sandy' sandals (Reef Sandy Sandal - Women's). I prefer the sandy design much more. While these shoes are cute, and come in cute colors, the shoe is kind of narrow, and the thinner strap is difficult to slide into. For the price, it is worth it to spend the few extra dollars, and get the sandy's."
110862,1,"I have a large, wide foot (for a soccer player) and I've found that the Adidas 7406 fits better than any other boot I've worn. The calf-skin upper is supple and conforms to my foot, and I actually prefer the way it feels on contact to the feel of my Copas. I find the Copas long, narrow, and rigid after heavy use, but these uppers have stayed soft and tough despite heavy use. I've bought a second pair for when my first pair wears out (if they do!)."
44550,1,Very happy customer. My feet are somewhat wide and full so I was pleased these shoes fit comfortably right out of the box. I bought an 8.
313651,1,"I'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a &quot;speciality sport&quot; shoe. When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago, the comments I got from friends were along the lines of &quot;I thought they made baseball [or volleyball] shoes.&quot;But, trust me: Mizuno makes great running shoes. The Wave Rider is - in my mind - the best 'cushion' shoe on the market today. With this seventh generation release of the model, Mizuno demonstrates it understands three important things about running shoes:- Most runners want a good high-mileage shoe for under $100. [The Wave Rider has stayed under $90 retail for all seven model releases.]- When runners find a shoe they like, they get ripped when the company either drops the model or radically re-imagines it for the next release. The Wave Rider has been incrementally tweaked and improved over the years, but the basic shoe remains the same.- I'm a runner. I don't want a hip, street shoe where style is first, running mechanics second. The Wave Rider is where it ought to be on the spectrum: there's a nod towards style, but I don't feel like a fashion victim.One sizing note: I traditionally take an 11 in all other types of shoes, but I need an 11.5 for the Wave Rider. That's been very consistent throughout the years."
1137,1,This was the best out there for the money. Bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. Very water proof after playing in the snow with the kids...
377103,0,"I have always liked Danner boots my last pair were the most comfortable boots I had ever worn the Men's Recon though are ""to long"" the ""toe is to pointed"" and there is ""zero arch support"" the little plastic insert they send along is an insult, unfortunately they are awkward and uncomfortable."
359311,0,"they fit slightly loose compared to the same size I have in a different color; other than that, they are made very sturdy"
385381,1,"I purchased these Reebok sneakers from Amazon.com. My husband has had a pair of Reebok Classic sneakers that are almost the exact same styling as the Reebok Exofit for probably more than 20 years. Since he couldn't buy the old shoes (apparently Reebok redesigned/stopped making this particular shoe)he just kept wearing them. They were horrible!! So he went online and found the Exofit. I knew that Amazon would have a better deal, and I was right. I ordered them and my husband absolutely loves them!"
311310,1,"IMHO Probably the toughest yet most comfortable work boot I have ever owned. I'm 57 been workin' since 14 and I've owned them all. Just bought my 2nd pair and I'll resole the 1st pair and they should be good for another 8-9 years. Wear mine to work (architectural woodwork, all sorts of glues, epoxies, chemicals, grease, etc., and lots of dust) and they are also excellent mototcycle boots, lighter than my Chippewas plus waterproof (gore-tex) and steel toed. All in all, one helluva boot."
129557,1,"The shoes run a little small so order a half size up, but I love the shoes overall. They fit great and are very stylish."
322798,1,I love these size 8 and a half Capezio ballet slippers. They are perfect for me for lounging around the house.
48145,1,Bought these for a friend ;love them;also bought myself a pr; would recommend buying these to anyone;the straps on the shoes are great;
82011,1,"I love these shoes. This was my second pair. The first pair had a leather sole and wore out quickly but these have a synthetic sole. They feel just as good but I hope to get a little longer wear out of them. However, I wear them a lot so I can't complain that they wear out! I have very sensitive narrow feet and have a tough time finding shoes. I tried these on in a B width in a department store to make sure the length was OK and then ordered the narrow. Enzo Angiolini is great in my book."
196046,1,"I did not order these on Amazon and it is a good thing I didn't. These flip-flops, while very comfortable, run really small. I wear a 10.5 size shoe and 11 in sandals and flip-flops. My first pair of Crocs (Crete style, years ago. Side note: I had those flip-flops for at least 4 years and they just wore out last month, and I wore them almost every single day and walked miles a day in them as well..too bad those are no longer being made)...Anyways, my first pair of Crocs I ordered in a size 11, perfect comfy fit. The Modi style, however, run small. I found them at my local shoe department, and tried on size 11, instantly painful. I kept going up in size until I reached 13, then it was perfect. That's quite a huge leap from 11 to 13.I was originally going to order a size 11 from here, but am so glad I found a store to try them on instead. Great flip-flop, very comfortable, feels durable, but runs really small.I recommend you find a store to try them on."
35204,1,I got these for my wife who had worn out her other ones and she loved the color and fit. She's a size 7 and these run true to size.
46943,1,"I have been a huge fan of the 760 series, starting with the 762, and all the way up. These are the best yet. Perfect support, and extreme comfort. They work with you to get great workouts. Buy them while they still have your size!"
309564,0,"These shoes are pretty but they do not fit my wide feet. My somewhat squared off toes could barely squeeze into the band across the top. I will see if my friend can wear them. If you have narrow feet and/or feet that fit well into pointy-toed shoes, these might be good for you."
147441,1,This is the only shoe that I have found that doesn't lose its support after months and months of wear. My husband now wears them too because he does a lot of walking and this shoe is really kind to his feet and back.
302840,1,"This product was as promised, delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Will purchase again from this site through Amazon."
178749,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
282513,1,"These are extreme heels are not so much made for walking in as posing in. Be aware that it takes exercise and preparation to stand and walk in these without hurting yourself. Due to the extreme posture they put your foot in these can put a great deal of pressure on your toes and calf muscles and tendons.That being said, they look great and make for some great photos!~Edit~ I recently became fascinated by ""pony boots"" bascially, boots that simulate Pony hooves, there is only one current manufacturer out there and their are half way round the world, expensive and very slow at communications, but then i thought about these boots.I'm in the process of modifying them into a pair of pony boots myself, the fact that the heel/platform is made of a solid block of wood has made it very easy. My first step was to modify the heel of the shoe a little, I shaved off approiximately one ince of the block heel, put them on and lo-and-behold I can walk in them all day. After staring at them a while I realized that the problem I was having before was that these shoes are designed to put you beyond verticle so you have to have your knees bent and weight shifted behind you to stand in them, this puts all kinds of unnatural pressure on your knees. Anyhow, by take a little off the heels you can stand up vertically and actually walk in them pretty cleanly.While I am sourcing the small hoseshoes I need to finish the modification I'll temporarily re-attach the heel pad and spend a little time practicing in them."
240812,1,"Following the recommendation of other reviewers I ordered a half size up and they fit perfectly. My only note is that mine did not have a flowered insole, just plain black which didn't bother me, but thought I'd mention it.I bought the patent leather which was pretty supple for patent and the taps are well secured. I think they will wear well!"
168690,1,"I bought these shoes because of the clearance price expecting an o.k. pair of shoes, but these were quite comfortable and required zero break in. The color is quite impressive and I have received many compliments on the color. Will buy another pair from this brand."
338336,1,they were a bit darker than what I expected but they were fine with me.there for a 6yr anyway..price good
377649,1,"I'm a footballer and or Soccer Player in the states might call and this Adidas Predator Pulse boot has been a revelation in my games ever since i got it. I got it in the white and red colour, Beckham's colour and it doesn't matter what colour its, its still same.The power that you got from this boot is unbelievable, the swerve and precision in great, Training makes perfect, if you are really into football or soccer, but this boot in its top class, K Leather, Traxion, PULSE... Pulsion is not that good, I reckon."
366835,1,"I bought these because I wanted something cuter than your average pair of sneakers for a vacation to Italy. I walked a LOT and they were extremely comfortable, and the mesh panels made them really cool and breathable. They look cute with everything from jeans to shorts. I got the white, and unfortunately they get pretty dirty, but you can just toss them in the washer and dryer. The only problem I ever had with them was that, while I was breaking them in, the stitching at the top rubbed on one of my toes and gave me a minor blister (easily fixed by wearing moleskin). I highly recommend them and plan on getting the black ones as well."
270823,1,"I recommend these shoes. They are comfortable and sleek. So far the soles are lasting a while with heavy wear. The price is a little steep. You could settle for the Payless knock-off versions, but you would certainly tell the difference!"
277489,1,"I have arthritis in my hips and knees. I am on my feet, all day, every day working for Fred Meyer. I walk many miles, on hard floors and, it was getting so I could hardly walk at the end of the day. At the end of the week, I was ready to die. I purchased these boots on the first day of a vacation and, decided I'd wear them during the vacation to break them in, so I wouldn't have to go through the ""new shoe pain"" at work. Well, there was never any painful breakin period. The boots felt fantastic from the start. Now, my hips and knees don't hurt at work. At all! These boots have made a terrific difference in my quality of life. I went out today, and purchased another pair, so I can switch them out so they'll last longer, and get to air out. I can't say enough good things about these boots and, can't think of a thing negative to say, either. I, honestly, may purchase a third pair just for the heck of it."
90186,1,"I read reviews of these before buying this pair - I have bought two pairs of Timberland boots before, one pair thats literally lasted app. 20 years with a lot of use, and another pair that only lasted two years. I received these in yesterday, and will update the review if they don't break in well or last. So far my impressions are - 1. Accurate to size, 13w, I wear New Balance / Nike wide tennis shoes as additional reference 2. Comfortable, but not cushiony if you know what I mean, I wore them all day yesterday without blisters or sore spots 3. I was expecting non insulated boots, which I got, but these are still warm to hot - gussetted tongue and no ventilation means these are not a boot I am looking forward to wearing on a construction site in the middle of a Texas summer. I have received in what I expected, and given Timberlands reputation and my exp I'm giving it 5 stars pending further experience with this pair of boots."
35002,1,The perfect shoe. Fits good and is comfortable. Love all Dansko shoes and prefer them since I am on my feet most of the day as a nurse. Great investment.
171917,0,Greetings! Thanks for the fast shipment of the item i purchased.i just have a concern regarding the quality of the product. i played badminton as my hobby and i used the shoes as soon as i got it. my concern is that the left side portion of the left shoe got torn after i used it for 1 week. I like the overall performance of the item and it suits my game.
387947,1,This show is so comfortable and looks great with anything. Light weight with clean lines. No need to wear them in. They are instantly comfortable.
248516,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
285134,0,"Boots served me very well for about two years of occasional light (weekend) hiking and wintertime wear. But after this period, they started falling apart, with the upper splitting and tearing right at the sole line, stitching letting go, etc. Per the recommendation on Columbia's warranty page, I sent in photos of the failure, and of the sole (documenting the very light usage they had received), to see if they might offer a repair or credit towards new boots or something. Was informed that since the boots were out of warranty, they would do nothing.These were the fifth pair of midweight hiking boots I've bought since I was a teenager, all of similar weight and stiffness. All other brands (Timberland, Asolo, EMS, Vasque) have lasted until I wore the lugs off the soles (five years at least) and have survived much more abuse than these boots did. I'll give them three stars for their good comfort, support and water resistance, but given the short service life and Columbia's lack of concern about it, they get no more stars than that, and I won't be buying any Columbia boots in the future."
75952,1,I have owned these sandals before and just love how comfortable they are. I have tried very hard to find ones to compare with being as comfortable when wearing to do shopping and to do anything for a long time. I would definitely recommend them for comfort and durability.
148795,1,"Goose bottom, very comfortable, design classic, like the net, so happy. For the whole family all bough minnetonkaSize just, wearing is very easy"
122135,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
41912,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
229345,1,"This is a great pair of shoes, for the every day and more but not quite a good shoe for sports, it s a little tigh should have the W size but still it s a great choice, nice materials and arrive in the expected time"
218882,1,I had a pair of Converse Chuck Taylor High tops that I used to wear all of the time. After about 4 years I wore them out and into the ground. I decided I want to buy some low tops to replace it so I can wear it with some shorts. They came as described and even with an extra pair of red laces.
355812,1,"great value, has an arch support that is not bulky at all - color is true to photo shown, arrived quickly!the shoe does run a size smaller than regular street size - had to return & reorder larger and that process was very easy"
78412,1,converse are always great for outdoors. Perfect for people who break dance and also for style. First wear is not the best because it hurts your feet but after a month or so it will be comfortable. The only thing I dont like is because it is not water proof so if it rains then your feet gets wet no matter and its hard to slip shoes on like other athletic shoes.
97876,1,"So comfortable, lightweight and convenient. Now I've graduated to Crocs Malindi. They're my ""dress"" Crocs. I highly recommend!!"
104292,1,"After being associated with the 50's hipster and the 70's hippie, the 80's punk and now the millennium prepster these shoes have made the journey across time and generation. Made with a canvas material and a rubber soul these shoes stand the test of time and once thier broken in will quickly become your favorite pair of shoes . No matter the winter or the summer you'll find yourself pulling these out of the closet to pair with your jeans or your skirt. And owning one pair is never enough. A pair in every color low and high is definitly required for the true converse wearer. Buy your first pair today to emmerse yourself in a true piece of history and the future"
143113,0,Sized small.. Little toe on left foot hangs out No way to get full foot into it. This is my third Olowahu Flip FLop. The first was great and lasted forever. The second was like this one. Wore heal down in 3 months. Small Little Left Toe wont go into shoe or stay there if forced. Tore my little toenail back attempting to wear. I love Teva but wont buy another pair of these.
208224,1,I'm very pleased with these sneakers. They are sleek and fit well. They are very lightweight and will be good for outdoor terrain. The spikes are easily removed for indoor use. They are ventilated so that your feet don't overheat. The order was shipped in good time and the package arrived in excellent shape.
224987,1,"I'm wearing these bad boys right now. These sneakers have a sexy look to them, and you can't go wrong with classic chucks at this price. Buy them! Every one should have black and white sneakers in their collection. They feel great, and I haven't had any problems with them yet. This is well worth the purchase. :-)"
63428,1,"These boots are often on sale for $50 or less. That is a fantastic value for a all-leather waterproof hiking boot. These boots are not the lightest weight, but they are fairly durable. The leather is a little stiff when new, but breaks in quickly to give you a very comfortable semi-custom fit. The wide, thick sole gives you great stability on and protection from rocky trails. These boots do have an EVA midsole, so they won't last for years like high-end boots with polyurethane midsoles, but these do cost half the price of high-end boots."
216380,1,"These shoes are very well made. They hold up great to rough play. This is our second pair. The first pair still look great, but 1st grade feet grow fast!"
292646,1,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
325903,1,"Excellent footwear, very comfortable, is used for all occasion besides to have an economic price. Amazon is very responsible, the order arrived fast."
109573,1,"I just picked these up for my uniform working at A&F, and I gotta say there's a reason they'll never go out of style. These shoes are damn fine, and they're the only thing I own that'll really fit my flat feet. My roommate/coworker gets a lot of use out of them, too."
256981,2,"This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase. First they were ugly, second they were way too tight, and last they would never be something I would buy. It cost $10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to. This was false advertising if there ever was one."
59004,0,"I gave these shoes three stars because they are comfortable and good for just walking around. However, I would not ever do anything that involves running or jumping in these shoes. The aharp edge on the bottoms make it difficult to land safely. I've sprained my ankles three times in these shoes playing volleyball (went up for spike, came down with the worst sprain I've ever had), basketball (sprained while trying to cut while running; foot sideways and my ankle gave), and once just walking (walking along a sidewalk, I stepped on a tiny pebble. my foot went sideways, and the edge of the bottom cause my ankle to go out instead of helping my foot go flat. minor roll, could've sprained). I'm prone to sprains, but I've never had this many issues with any shoe before. Here's hoping it doesn't happen to someone else, though I'm sure it has."
365130,2,I returned these for credit because the very small lace eyelets were not right for the very wide laces. I have already rated these before.
195516,0,"I bought these shoes for my daughter ...because she just had to have them....last Christmas. They are darling, all leather uppers and the heel (which is really high to me..but what do I know) is wrapped in leather. The part where your foot goes in is wood and chips pretty easily. We ended up using a furnisher wood marker to cover it up. Kind of a bummer since they cost around $80.00. They are very cute you just have to be careful going up stairs, curbs etc.."
281031,1,I got just the right shoes I have been looking for they fit fine and look nice.Thank You
185169,1,"Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. I bought my first pair last summer, as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that. They are thin and have breathable mesh, I very much recommend you go out and buy them."
48093,1,"I love crocs. They are the only shoe that my feet are comfortable in. (I prefer to be barefoot, but retailers and employers frown on that.) But crocs have become more difficult to find in the rural area where I live. Walmart used to carry a good imitation that sold for only $5 or $6 a pair, but they don't have them anymore.I was so happy to find crocs on Amazon. They were cheaper than on the Croc website and they came quickly. I am a happy customer (with comfortable feet)."
134236,1,"This is an all-around great pair of wrestling shoes! I train MMA a little bit and with some of the drills the mats basically shave off the skin on my feet and I used to get blisters too! With these I get great grip and protection for my feet and if you tie them up correctly then you get good ankle support too.One thing, keep off of carpet while wearing them. Pet hair and lint sticks to the bottom like glue (the bottom is rubber in some areas) and therefore reduces traction until you clean them off (lick your finger and rub the rubber and it takes the dirt off).They are very comfortable too, and I have big feet so it's hard to find comfy shoes. I'd wear these everywhere if they didnt wet through so bad in rain and snow."
289111,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
84548,1,I just received the Crocs this week. I started wearing them immediately. They have really helped the trouble that I've been having with my hips and back.
1930,0,"My hiking involves work. As a UPS driver I step in and out of my truck about 180 times a day. On top of that I deliver a lot of apartments, up and down roughly 800-1000 steps a day. I hoped these boots would have been more comfortable based on other reviews. They do fit well and may be ok for a few hours but beyond that if you are on your feet all day I can't recommend."
186242,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
203148,1,"Good quality, nice, comfortable, they dry fast. Very good to walk on deck since they have good protection for thumbs."
40142,1,"productos cumple con lo requerido, producto recomendado, llego a tiempo tal como dec&iacute;a la fecha de arribo bien envalado. ok"
16268,0,I love these shoes but they are charging alot for a shoe that is usually very cheap. I knew i was paying more just so i didnt have to drive to chinatown to buy these but really $30 bucks for a $5 shoe? Come on
354236,1,i bought these for my husband...he loves them...they look good and they feel great....best buy...Buy these..they are worth every penny....
170860,1,My 2 1/2 year old LOVES these shoes! And I think they are too cute!! Shoes are true to size. Perfect fit!
77328,0,"Came on time, store did a great job getting my order to me on time.The shoe on the other hand seems to be made more for a man than a women.The strap does not stay forward, if you decide to wear them without the strap in the back.I have an old pair of these crocks and they are just not the same."
265958,1,Great buy. Size fit perfectly. Normal wear and tear is almost unnoticeable. I gave them a four because in the beginning they cut at the back of my ankle but after a month or so of wearing them out they now fit like a glove. Came before delivery date. I highly recommend them. :) :) :) :) :)
123473,0,"These boots are well made and comfortable. They are reasonably warm, OK down to maybe -10 F, and waterproof as advertised. The zippers work really well.They are great for mud, snow and slush. However, the soles let go entirely as soon as they encounter any ice. My ordinary shoes perform far better. Now I have the choice of dry feet or broken bones."
46347,1,The Riva loafers are a great product. I have been looking for a 14 B pair for many months ... and should have checked with Amazon first! Fantastic price with free shipping included.
274602,1,"These boots are quite the surprise! At first I thought ""another tennis shoe boot"" . Not so! I started to wear them to get a feel and they were pretty good out of the box. After a long committed hike of about ten miles I stopped and thought wow these are actually feeling BETTER than when I started! From there on I hunted in these for about 60 miles with close to 20 thousand verticle feet(checked by GPS). They were great! I have had two neuromas removed from my feet and soft shoes are a must have. These have been the best boots even against my Danners at half the weight and a quarter of the price. They also have great traction in all conditions. In wet deep grass they will get wet inside. They also don't stink inside unlike older boots of this type. Will I buy another pair? Well I'm shopping for another pair to replace these right now."
195406,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
365663,1,"These shoes are great. I value a lightweight, sturdy, hightop shoe for playing basketball(prison rules style) with the 11 other firefighters I work with. They require a tough foot, but if you can hack it they will save you some money."
156932,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
247591,1,I've worn Bostonians for over 15 years and they are great for my weird feet. I'm wide at the toes and narrow at the heels and the Bostonian wides fit me great. They last forever - I have one pair that is on its second re-sole.
205815,1,"I have this walking sandal in white and tan, as well as the black ones I recently purchased from Amazon.com. They fit great and are very comfortable for all day wear. I wear a size 13 N, and it's difficult to find shoes, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon.com. Another plus was Amazon's price was much less than where I'd purchased the other two pair."
183706,1,"These shoes are incredibly light and wearing them after wearing construction shoes all day, make you want to run ! The material does not seem very strong but I guess all light weight shoes are like that. The sizing is a little screwed up. Size 10 is really size 9.5. So buy 0.5 sizes up. But You can still fit into ""your"" size and the shoes easily expand.The only annoying thing I found is that the footprint is so small that it feels like your feet are touching the ground at an angle. Maybe this is the right way to be running .. I dont know. I have run about 10 miles with these shoes so far and they seem to be adjusting ... so maybe after a few more weeks, I will get better used to having my feet touch the ground with these shoes. I am just used to shoes that touch the ground flat and your feet inside the shoes cannot rock them back and forth sideways ... but I guess a shoe this light and contoured does allow extreme flexibility and I am just not used to that.And note that while they provide very good grip on all sorts of wet and gainy pavement, they dont provide very much support at all so I can see a lot of potential ankle twists if you run with them ""out back"" like the name suggests. The small foot print I think will easily let your foot pivot in unnatural ways on loose soil.On tar and concrete though, they are excellent. An excellent and light running shoe. Just the sizing is screwed up and has a very bounded footprint."
323094,1,"This is a wonderful trad shoe and would make for a great all-around/multidiscipline shoe. It's non-aggressive shape, comfortable toe box, and padded tongue make it extremely comfortable for long routes or all-day wear, and it has a strong hard rubber sole wrapping up high on the sides that makes it great in cracks and edges. It has a lace channel that wraps around the back of the ankle, which provides a perfect tight fit without digging. I am a very experienced climber, have had at least 20 different shoes by various brands (I use different shoes for different disciplines) and I understand now why I always see this shoe around the best trad crags in the world. The comfort factors of this shoe would make it great for a beginner, and while it does not have the aggressiveness or pointy toe box of the best sport/bouldering shoes out there, would make a great shoe for any climber who wants a shoe they can use for multi-discipline or long session climbing. I have gone through 6 pairs of LaS shoes in 3 different models, have always been satisfied with the durability and strength of La Sportiva's shoes and I don't doubt that this shoe will live up to the brand's reputation."
242797,1,Great product!I'll highly recommend.My only comment: it has not the inside flower design as shown in the photo
179306,1,These shoes are a total classic. My son wanted these because they're the same ones David Tenant wears in Dr. Who. Now I need to order another pair because he wears them exclusively. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a stylish and comfortable everyday shoe.
245229,2,"Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks, they gave me foot problems. I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them. Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time."
58886,1,"Having reviewed numerous other styles of 'casual' type sneakers, I opted to go with several pairs of this New Balance style, in different colors. But I particularly favor this particular Navy / Grey color style. Stylish and comfortable, I haven't any complaints after wearing these for several weeks now (and I've even ordered a second pair of this color scheme)."
299772,1,This is the only shoe I will wear even in the winter. My feet just feel so much better when I wear Birks!
28052,1,"These shoes are so cute. I bought two pairs of different colors, red and black. There are so cute and look great with jeans and pants. I would not want to wear them with a skirt though as the wedge heels are very noticeable, which I think is partially caused by the bright color because they are nicely shaped.These are good quality shoes. The inside are made of leather, and the rubber sole make them not click on a not-carpeted floor, which I really like."
102434,1,"The title pretty much says it all. I was looking for a good pair of Skechers at a fair price.These fit the bill. I looked on Ebay first, and the lowest price on Ebay for these exact shoes was 20 dollars higher then I paid from this seller on Amazon. Seller had Great communications, and shipped VERY QUICKLY."
248281,0,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
124517,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
272297,1,"This is the third pair of Five Ten Spire shoes that I have owned. They are great for long days on multi-pitch climbs. The leather upper forms to my feet and gives just enough to make a great all day shoe. The four star rating is because they seem to wear a little faster than my other shoes. If you are looking for comfort and performance for an entry level price, this is one shoe to try."
368427,1,"First time ordering shoes online so I was a bit skeptical, but I'm glad I did. Shoes came as shown in the image, the size of the DVS shoes might be slightly bigger than what I was used to.Shoes came with 2 sets of laces, black/white.Came with a bunch of stickers and key chains but just fluff.The actual shoes have been good to me, been wearing them for more than a year now. As with all white shoes they do get dirty pretty fast.The grip of the shoes leaves something to be desired, but I'm not exactly a skater so I can't say if they work well in a ""skating"" environment. I've played football in the park with them and they held up ok, but I wouldn't recommend doing anything rigorous with them like.. hiking up a steep hill."
207654,1,"I love these boots, the color is neutral ""the new nude"" for the season and they look great with boot cut jeans and long skirts. The heel height is comfortable and their stunning. These peep toes boots draw attention everytime I wear them; because my cute red or pink toes are exposed. Great price also, I would definitely purchase another pair of Carlos Santana boots or shoes."
260635,1,Fast shipping. Thank You!! I bought these for my son. I may buy a 2nd pair. He normally wears a size 14 but in these I bought a 13 and they fit fine. He loves them.
331972,0,"I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable. I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor. The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them, and I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might. In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these."
31089,1,I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma &quot;Anjan&quot;.
209500,1,"They are very comfortable. However, they have stretched some so I will putinserts into them & that should correct it. Otherwise very comfortable. If theyhave them in brown I will order."
176264,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
77734,1,"The shoes look well made, but I Have not worn them much at this time. I am wondering if buying shoes online is really a good move since it is hard to know if fit will be proper. The 8 1/2 D I have worn with SAS shoes for the past twenty+ years seems to be slightly tight with these shoes in comparison. I have noticed that other buyers have had trouble with fit problems with shoes purchased in this way.I will know more on this issue as I wear these shoes in the next few months and will try to update this review at that time."
154727,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
86837,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
330071,1,"I Love these shoes! For a long time I have been searching for shoes that are beautiful, versatile, AND comfortable enough to walk in. So far these totally fit the bill. They're SO cute and go with absolutely everything, and while I have a history of virtually all shoes digging painfully into the backs of my heels, these hurt maybe only half as much. I certainly won't be bleeding by the time I can get some heel cushions. They also feel very stable, and not that high at all. Perfect!"
141120,0,"Purchased these shoes through a different retailer and found them on clearance. These are adorable, but I wouldn't pay $84 for them. They are a bit slippery on the bottom before getting some scuffing(i have other shoes with much better traction). I am either a 9 1/2 or a 10, depending on the shoe and opted for the 9 1/2 in these. The first few days were a little rough stretching out the peep toe, but once they formed to my foot it was a perfect fit. As i said, they are adorable."
243780,1,"Already have Chucks in white, which I wore for the b-ball team in high school...yeah, when Chucks were the shoes to be wearin'!! Decided to re-live days of Sandlot Black PF Flyers with the magic wedge, make you run faster, jump higher! But when I got them, they were about a 1/3 size too small and the shoes felt uneven (one bigger than the other, both still tight). Thought I could wear them in and couldn't. Chalked up to a loss. Paid less for black Chucks and they fit true to size! Love these black Chucks! GREAT PURCHASE!!Wonder what the difference is in the monochrome black. Anyone know?"
175906,0,Great looking shoes but too narrow for my feet and they kept sliding out. Had to return them but women with narrow feet probably won't have trouble.
335454,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
173163,1,"These sneakers are lightweight and havewonderful cushioning. I wear them all the time,and have two pairs so I can switch between them.They are excellent walkers."
364510,1,"My son loves Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars, and these are so durable! He wanted the high tops this time, so I got these for him. He loves them, and they came so quickly even though it was during Christmas season rush."
219750,1,Love my chucks. This is my second pair. The blue goes with everything. I teach preschool and they are comfortable and fun to wear to work.
280405,1,"FITS TRUE TO THE SIZE. I found the leg opening to be rather big ,these are not for the skinny leg girls !! I never wear hells but wanted something sexy for the bedroom this did it and after just a few minutes of walking in them I was comfortable !"
275093,1,"I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s."
309012,0,"These were to be my husband's favorite slippers, until yesterday. The stitching is letting go around the top on one slipper, and on both, the plastic heel backer have broken and now ""click"" when he walks or sits. ""Luckily"" on the one the stitching is letting go, the back seam where the plastic is wasn't stitched correctly and opened up. I was able to remove all the plastic and super glue the seam shut. For the brand reputation, I wouldn't have thought this to happen so quickly with minimal wearing. For the price, I would have expected this from a cheaper pair. Guess they aren't made like they used to. Style, function, comfort and warmth, I would have given 5 stars, but these hiccups take 2 away."
33615,1,"These shoes are great,they can be worn down with jeans and a tee or worn with nice dress clothes.I'm getting the ones in pink.Get these shoes if considering.Very comfy also[Holla Back]"
12714,2,"I don't know. They look weird, the sole's soooo different from my other converse!!! Buuu"
247532,1,I have worn these shoes for a while now and I love them because of the low heel and still a classy look for work. I always order them online. They arrive quickly so it saves shopping around town for my size an color. They are true to size and I can wear them all day at work without any complaints.
84596,1,"I just got these shoes- the soles are uncomfortable, but they were on $13 and they look pretty nice- a good deal on a shoe you will just wear every once in a while for the looks."
272972,1,"This is the third pair of Five Ten Spire shoes that I have owned. They are great for long days on multi-pitch climbs. The leather upper forms to my feet and gives just enough to make a great all day shoe. The four star rating is because they seem to wear a little faster than my other shoes. If you are looking for comfort and performance for an entry level price, this is one shoe to try."
264729,1,"I bought two pairs of these shoes, black croc and brown croc. They are so comfortable and I wear them so much that the black ones are nearly worn out and I will order another pair soon."
53475,1,"I had to break into these shoes before they got comfortable, but shipping was fast and it's a great price for the quality of the shoes. I've never had Keds before so idk if it's quality has gotten better or worse, but you get what you paid for."
34867,1,"The Dansko Professional Clog is the only shoe I can wear for the entire day and still be happy at the end of the day. I love these shoes and I own them in every color, (almost). Buy and be comfortable!"
260219,1,"These were a purchase for my 13 year old granddaughter. Although I have not physically seen them because they live in VA and I in MN, she tells me that they are just what she wanted. Pleased with the ease of this transaction and the speed in which they were shipped to her. Thank you."
230686,1,"Great Boot, great price. Extemely comfortable!! Would recommend this item to anyone. Purchased as a gift for my son. They run about 1/2 size big so I kept his pair and ordered a second pair for him."
58147,1,they were great while they lasted (: after so many wears i donated the shoes. such a shame :( i miss them
325187,1,"I've played soccer all my life and this is one of the best soccer shoes ever made. Very durable, very comfortable, soft leather, nice fit."
104333,1,Great pair of shoes with a lot of history. the only crappy thing is that i lost them... :Cthe shipping was quick and with a low price and yes... they were not avaliable for super saver shipping...Highly recommend them for everyone
253217,1,"I am not one to usually rave, quite frankly, about shoes. I will make an exception here and tell you that if you are in the market for a pair of Chukka boots, don't look any further. The look, the feel....everything about these met and exceeded my expectations. I admit I did not initially believe the many other reviewers saying to order a 1/2 to a full size down so I bought my normal shoe size...but they were right and I returned them for a 1/2 size down. Perfect fit, but I know everyone's foot is different. Be aware, though, they do run large.Will definitely buy another pair in another color. Versatile shoe. Be sure to weatherproof it first and you're good to go."
91574,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
54497,1,"I am on my second pair of these trail stompers. There is virtually no break in period at all. I wore them a few years ago on a day hike up to the summit of Mt. Whitney - no problems at all. I did have the nylon rip where the laces go, but for $10.00 a local cobbler took care of it."
182583,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
53974,1,"I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2, but that appeared to not be an option. I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size. I use extra inner soles & that helps, but I wish my size was available."
266029,1,"I have enjoyed wearing Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV for a number of years now----a good product. I titled this review as a ""Work Shoe"", but they are an excellent walking boot for me as well."
74497,1,Perfect shoe for light outdoor activity and also used for indoor daycare shoes. I love the brown for all around color and comfort and goes with many outfits.
44711,1,Perfect fit. The inside is comfortable and I dont feel the cramps I feel with other shoes. I also find it very easy to maintain balance wearing this shoe...I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys comfort!!!
93721,0,The stitching on heel rubbing causing blister. Good protection with weed eater. but need stitching fixed.
347596,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
346334,1,"The way one dresses is a form of expressing our likes and interests, we express our style down to the shoe, literally. Having such a vast variety of brands to chose from, what style and price suits best to an individual can be challenging. So why not save a couple dollars on a good pair of shoes that can give you style, comfort, and suit both male and female gender? Converse foot wear is the perfect answer for all of these categories by offering everything one can ask for. What was started in 1908 by Marquis Mills Converse with Chuck Taylor joining in 1918 as a sneaker for athletic wear would become a stye trend by the 1950's. The Chuck Taylor All Star collection is the most popular collection from the converse brand with the wide range of colors it has to offer.In this tough economic time everyone is trying to get the best deal on the products they want most, no one wants to spend over one hundred dollars on a pair of shoes because we cannot afford it, or we're just trying to spend our money wisely. Converse prices range anywhere from thirty to eighty dollars depending on the style of the shoe. Some of Converse competitors are Nike and Vans both having decent shoes but at ridiculous prices both having shoes start at fifty dollars and going over a hundred dollars, which is not worth the money. Luckily All Stars can save you a couple dollars and still be stylish.Not only is the price reasonable for this product but you also get an enormous variety of colors to select from making your possibilities endless. From personal experience I have used over 10 pairs of Chuck Taylor's and have many colors and styles to chose from. This collection being my favorite, with the options of choosing either high tops or the classic low tops one cannot go wrong.The classic style of the black and white low top is simply a must have for everyones closet. These shoes are long lasting and comfortable to wear the entire day. Having worn both Vans and Nike's in the past they were no where near being as comfortable as chucks are. No one wants to walk around with blisters on there feet from having a bad pair of shoes.Converse suit a broad range of ages from infants, teenagers, to young adults and even mature adults. Both male and female foot wear run in very similar looks making it almost hard to know which shoe is male and which is female which is great. From previously being a high school student and now in college I saw that this age group gets the biggest use out of chucks since they have a simple sold look to them and in no way are uncomfortable. These shoes are for a more casual look, and fit to any persons style, so they're for every day use making it easy in the morning not having to decided what style of shoe you'll wear because you'll know exactly what pair of shoe to reach for.Having comfort, style, and a great price for a pair of shoes makes ones choices endless, and makes you want to get more than just one pair of shoes. So why wouldn't you want to go get a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse, It is the best choice you can ask for and you most defiantly wont regret buying this pair of shoes. Best way to go is to purchase a cheap pair of shoes that look great a provide the best comfort as apposed to having a good looking pair of shoes on the exterior and uncomfortable on the interior."
377844,2,"I've owned 2 pairs of these now, and I'll never own another Blackhawk boot. Although initially I thought these were good boots, time has proven otherwise. In less than 1 year of wear on each set, the inner lining comes loose in the heel area and makes them uncomfortable to wear. The soles are dangerously slippery on anything wet, like tile or cement. The soles de-laminate from the cushion part of the boot. The protective borders crack around the toe. One set started cracking by the laces about midway up the boot. One set had the stitching on the tab to help pull on the boot on tear loose. I called Blackhawk twice for service, no real help. Finally got hold of their Customer Service manager, he tried to make me feel like all the issues were my imagination, and had no value as feedback, even though I was pleasant and trying to give them good information. After 4 years as an Army Ranger, I know a thing or two about boots, so Blackhawk boots are poor quality, as is their service."
226563,1,"100 por ciento complacido con la compra, llegaron en buenas condiciones y son de muy buena calidad. Altamente recomendados y a muy buen precio. Gracias."
83266,1,"I don't like bling (rhinestones, glitter or sequins crap) on my flip flops and these fit the bill for plain, black, utilitarian-type flips flops that I was looking for. After reading so many great reviews I was sold! And although Zappos had a tiny bit better deal for 2 pairs I bought them from Amazon because I only wanted the one pair in black. But a few reviews at Zappos did mention that these flip flops do run a bit small. I wear a 7.5 (and intended to buy a 7.0 like my other flip flops) but decided to follow the reviewers suggestions and get one size larger. It was good advice - the 8.0 fit perfect! I love them and I do feel some arch support which is better than none. I would buy these again."
208349,1,"Yummy, yummy, yummy. I am about to retire and have worn high heels for years and years and my feet prove it. These little ballet shoes feel like my feet are encased in clouds. The adorable little snub nose the little v and bow are just too cute. The absolutely go with everything. I have every color Gap makes in theirs but they are not near as comfortable. I was forced to get a half size larger because I could not find a ""9"" but I could have worn any size from 8-10 and been comfortable. I am going to buy a spare just in case I can't find them when these wear out. Paula"
299207,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
55020,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
125391,1,"My wife bought me a pair of these slippers, and they are the absolute best I've ever worn. I love them!. They are so comfortable and natural feeling that right after I got them I forgot I had them on and wore them when I went out to run some errands. The lady at the bank laughed and called me ""Slipper boy"" when I noticed them on my feet and commented I'd just gotten them and really liked them"
175899,1,"I've wanted these shoes for awhile now. I just didn't need them, so I waited until the right time to buy them. I'm so glad they were still here to purchase. I love these. Now if the snow would only melt I could wear them not just inside but outside too! LOL.I took advantage of the $20 off when you spend $80 deal. While I was buying some shoes for my husband for xmas I had to buy myself something too so I could qualify for the discount. These shoes were it!Like some of the other ratings mentioned, these shoes are incredibly comfortable. I am a huge shoe collector and most of them are high heels. I always say, ""it hurts to be beautiful"". Most of my heels are gorgeous but not the most comfortable. Not true with these Dr. Scholl's. They fit beautifully, are soft under the foot and made to last. I'm so happy with this purchase. I can't wait for the weather to change now!"
151568,0,"Sorry ladies. I want to love these boots more. Yes the footbed is like a sneaker. Yes they look good. I get compliments. But they make my feet sweat. I have to change my socks at least once a day, and I'm not super sweater. I have other boots, no sweat problems. But with these it's just a matter of time before my feet are freezing because I'm rotting in cold, wet socks.And, they. are. hard. I know you need to break boots in an all, but they're hard as heck. Tight. I'm talking tight on my instep. Feels like a vice-grip on the top of my foot. They're easing up, but I don't know if they'll ever be truly comfortable. And maybe I'm the wrong person to review these, because I don't ride, or muck out stalls, or whatever. I live in the city. But I wanted a pair of boots that were as comfy as the boots I wore in High School. Not so much.If you're a half-size, get the half size. Don't size down. I can barely get my hoof into these as it is.If I had the money to spend again, would I buy these boots? Probably not.But they're well put together. I'll probably have them two decades from now and may then, just maybe they'll be comfortable, before disintegrating entirely."
196391,1,"...Chuck Taylor All Stars are good for doing squats. That's why I buy them. A lot of athletic shoes have a good amount of padding on the bottom, which is fine for running, but while doing squats, makes my feet feel slightly wobbly. The Taylors allow my feet to stay firmly planted, which helps me maintain proper technique."
200024,1,"As I have been wearing Earth shoes exclusively for the past 5 years, I knew exactly what I was getting when I placed my order. My sister & I both call them miracle shoes. They will feel different if you are wearing them for the first time, because the heel is a little lower than the toe; therefore, there is naturally an adjustment period of aproximately 10 to fourteen days. Before I started wearing these shoes, all I could think about was my feet and how much they hurt. I was on my feet my entire work day and by the end I had to concentrate on just putting one foot in front of the other. My pain was terrible. My first day of wearing these shoes, the pain was much better. After the first two weeks, it was gone! My back ache was less, too! I forgot about my feet, and I could concentrate on my job! I admit, I do have favorites and this Lazor is one of them..very comfy and weighs next to nothing! When I saw them on sale, I snatched them up! If your feet hurt, give them a try. I won't wear any other brand!"
294307,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
314306,1,"I love this shoe. It is comfortable and easy to move in (considering the height); despite a stiletto heel, it doesn't wobble. I have these in red and they are awesome with jeans, work pants, and my dress collection. The toe cleavage thing is very true, but thats the style intended. I always get steve maddens a size down because the brand usually runs small, and that worked for these shoes. I wouldn't recommend them for people with long toes (especially a long second toe) because they are not designed with a lot of extra wiggle room."
360423,0,"Like most people have said, I'd suggest a half size up from your regular shoe size. I had bought character shoes from this company before, so I was pretty sure how they'd fit, but they changed the material they use for the top of the shoe since my first purchase. Now the black cover on the upper part of the shoe scuffs off VERY easily. I have only used mine for one show and there are already places where the top layer is rubbing off. I'm hoping that some black shoe polish or something like it will help."
192853,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
914,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
186090,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
365696,1,"Chuck Taylor Converse All-Star shoes are, by far, the best shoes you could ever have the pleasure of slipping your feet into each day! I own three high rise (black, pink, orange), and two low rise (green, red), and if you are in indecision about getting a pair, GET THEM! Whether you get the All-Stars or the skateboard style, you will NOT regret your decision! You can see them all at www.conversegallery.com, so check it out! These shoes are incredibly durable, and provide comfortable ankle support, making it easy to move aroung as fast as you want; you have to keep up with the shoes, not vice versa! These are basketball shoes, so they are great for running, basketball, soccer, and sport you could think of! Or, they could be just casual shoes. Another wonderful feature is that they are uni-sex, so guys and girls can wear them! Converse All-Stars RULE!"
27181,1,"My daughter need these specific character shoes for her Dance Club at college. The shows arrived in 2 days after placing the order, from NY a few dance after Hurricane Sandy. The shoes are amazing as Capezios are & the seller gave service beyond reproach. Highly recommend shoes & seller through Amazon!"
242625,1,"These shoes are great,they can be worn down with jeans and a tee or worn with nice dress clothes.I'm getting the ones in pink.Get these shoes if considering.Very comfy also[Holla Back]"
9118,1,"SCREW WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING! I purchased these and they came within 3 days. They are VERY comfortable, light, goes with anything you wear, and they are cheap. I bought some from Payless and these are WAAAAAAAAAY better :)"
240225,1,"These shoes fit better than most on me as I have really wide feet. I like the suede outer as well, as it has a nice sporty but cozy look. Great purchase!"
72566,0,"I liked the boots, they fit comfortably. However after wearing them a few tims one of the lace hooks broke loose. Still wearable though, and I enjoy my boots alot."
272386,1,Got them for a little girl who is almost 7. She loves them and they are holding up very well. She got two pairs and both look well made and true to picture color. From what I can tell the sizes run spot on as well.
295837,1,Yaktrax are a great item. Works like a charm. Perfect for using after Kentucky had the worst ice storm of its history. Bought some for my entire family after that.
288667,1,hola todo fino Excelenteeeeee muy hola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommendy poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendobuenoooooooooooooooooooo recomendado
6119,1,This is a nice sandal that can be worn just about anywhere in the house.It is very comfortable. It is very light and durable. I use it after I shower and sometimesI forget I have them on. The price is affordable but well worth it.
90444,1,These shoes are very comfy and warm but I have two complains:1) they run small. I usually wear a 4.5 - 5.5. I ordered 6 and they just fit.2) These shoes stain EASILY! I spilled some plain old water as I was doing dishes and it stained the shoes. Cost me $20 to have them re-stained by a shoe cobbler. Make sure you spray them with water repellent first. I did that after they were re-stained and now they're ok but I learned the pricey way.
162634,1,I've always been pleased with French Shriner shoes. I was a little concerned about ordering online but the shoes fit fine (and Amazon is easy to work with if they need returning). Great shoe at a great price.
207506,0,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
314768,1,This was purchased as a gift and was received with pleasure. It is just as described and has been put to good use. Very good length.
101750,0,"The ballet slipper quality appears to be fine. However, they do run small. I read the reviews and thought they would be big or normal sizing but I found them to be small."
97394,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
25737,1,"This was my first New Balance shoe ever. I've seen people wear New Balance brands so I decided to try it. This shoe is VERY comfortable, cushioned, and make great for street walking. I am not very active and normally wear sandals or dress shoes so perhaps this is why they are comfortable. I have not worn athletic shoes in years. I am definitely going to buy New Balance in the future. I like the look of this shoe and the look of their other shoes."
221405,1,Love these boots. They are just what I was looking for to keep my feet and ankles warm. Shipping was super fast.
387332,1,"I am on my feet at least 8 hours a day and would not even think about not wearing these socks! If I don't, by the time I get home my legs are swollen so bad. The low compression seems to be working just fine for me. The socks stay up and do not make your feet sweat. I now own three pairs!"
363297,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
344046,1,"These boots are highly recommended. Pricey but you get made in the USA quality. These boots will last. My fit was 1/2 size smaller than regular boots. The boots have an excellent speed lace system and are waterproof and warm. They feel a bit heavy at first, but you get used to the solid feel of these boots. Has an agressive Vibram tread which won't let you down."
153348,1,I started wearing these shoes after having a hip replacement several years ago. At that time the attraction was that they were so easy to slip on. They have the good support that I expect from Easy Spirit. I now have them in several colors and wear them all the time. Even the ones which have been washed frequently look good.
275268,2,"I have owned these boots for years. They are very good Quality and very Comfortable. They lasted me winter after winter. In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times. Now for the pair I ordered, not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer. The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove. Assuming they were the same, I purchased a pair from Amazon (which is priced excellent) but they did not fit proper at all. The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something... and are no longer the same. Which is too bad. So as far as Amazon goes... ""flawless as usual"" Returning them was not a problem. Just beware of these boots. Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON, CANADA :)"
88640,2,"In less than two months of use, one of the lower strap retaining ring retainer broke. Leaving only the top strap to secure the shoe."
113492,1,"I ordered the silver character shoes and they are great! High quality and comfortable! And the silver color is unique, so they do stand out! Very shiny!"
96565,1,I chose this product over other slip on shoes advertised because of the aggressive sole. I live in snow country (Tahoe) and was looking for a shoe that I could slip into after removing my snow boots. The shoe still had to provide good traction for athe occasional jaunt across the parking lot in ice and snow. They fit great and give great traction. The only criticism I have of them is that they are not very waterproof. The suede upper stains very easily. I should have immediately applied some form of spray on stain guard...was concerned that it would darken the suede in a non-uniform manner.
246884,1,Ryka shoes are great. I have aerobic shoes and the mules and they both fit great. I highly recommend these shoes.
279510,1,"Originally went for 15s as I usually wear a 14 1/2 or 15, but this was way way too big. Got the 14's instead and they are actually a little long in the toe. Absolutely no support in these shoes at all, not that I was really expecting any. Just wanted to try them out. They are great as far as outfitting goes...they go with anything. But, do not plan on doing any major hiking in them. They are casual shoes and are for just that...being casual! Overall not a bad shoe though!"
309145,0,"This was a very nice shoe, stylish, but on my feet the sides gapped and the toes were too tight. I think it's my feet and not the shoe."
332844,1,"I got this shoes for my daughter who already has the regular crocs and loves them; but since I wanted the shoes lo be a little different I decided on this model. She LOVES THEM ALSO! She says not only they are very comfortable but also more dressy than the regular ones. They are easy to wash too so the kids are always looking good and modernly fashion.My only complaint as a parent is the fact that this shoes are not made in the U.S.A. but in China. I live in Mexico and shipping to my country, when an item is made in China, costs me 200% of the price."
304645,1,"I have 4 pairs of Naughty Monkey shoes, and love them all! I always get compliments when I'm wearing them. I bought these in a 7.5 because I really wanted them, but I usually wear a 7. I put heel pads in them and they fit fine. I walked 8 city blocks in them and had them on for a night out with the girls and my feet didn't hurt at all. I wear heels almost daily though, so I'm not sure how someone who didn't would feel after a night wearing them."
89859,1,"I just purchased my 4th pair of these shoes. They are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn over the years, and they wear like iron with the following exception. The soles of the shoes cracked right through the instep. The first pair cracked well over 2 years after I purchased them, with the second pair cracking just over a year after purchase.I wish this company would get wise and revise the shoe sole so it wasn't prone to cracking. Had the last two pair re-soled at my local shoe repair and now use them for all manner of yard work. They are a great walking shoe, and nice enough looking to wear out for shopping and running errands.I do recommend them with the above caveat in mind. If you don't wear any one pair of shoes for a long time then it may not matter to you. Me, well I keep and wear my shoes forever, and by that I mean years so it is irk-some to have this happen to a shoe you love. However irk-some it is, I will continue to buy this shoe because their pluses far outweigh the negative and that negative can be corrected."
302383,1,"muy buen producto y muy buen vendedor, todo me salio como yo esperava y hasta ahora todo esta muy bien."
360943,1,Nice and confortable sneakers. Very good quality. Shipment was fast!Love it!!!
217413,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
358355,1,I would give this a 5 star but they were a bit snug in comparison to the same show in leather. recommendation- order 1/2 size larger. My daughter tried on the leather style in a store prior to purchasing these on line and needed them pronto for a theater performance. Shipping was fast and affordable compared to the shipping cost of a dance store we usually purchase from. Great shoe.
287480,1,These are my husband's favorite shoes. The store where he normally gets them doesn't carry them anymore. So when we're searching for something we go to Amazon. There they are! He ordered and they arrived within the time they said.
166444,0,"I normally wear a 9.5, all 3 pairs of sketcher i have bought thus far a 9's.There is not enough arch support for my day to day walking around but I can comfortably put in an insole. This shoe was bought for work and I walk between 3 to 6 miles in the course of my work day.Always wear either nude stockings or knee highs with this shoe because otherwise the shoe will cause blisters and I generally don't wear any enclosed shoe without some form of socks."
26417,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
89362,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
360278,1,I am very happy with the shoes! Great for dance lessons!Would certainly order them again and will recommend them to my friends.
282234,1,Little low for me but comfortable when totally inside.I think I must wear them naked the first few days because I cannot get in with socks. It's too low for me.
27481,2,"I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly. I have extra wide feet, so I was hoping these would be wide. They were NOT at all. Maybe a medium width, but more like narrow. Too bad. I wish I could find shoes that work. I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress, but won't look like one without the proper shoes."
218459,1,"Converse All Star are made to feel comfortable, this kind of shoes is never out of fashion, with jeans or shorts, wit t-shirts or shirts, once you wear a pair you will wish to have all of them."
179294,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
161261,2,Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it. I do not recommend this seller. Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back.
304894,0,"The boots look beautiful, are very warm, seem very practical but are wide enough to function as snow shoes. As a result I returned them."
285032,1,"Great boot, worth the price !! I bought them for my husband for work and they have been great , durable and most of all comfortable"
268861,1,"I used to wear rockports when in sales years ago and, I am glad to find they still make a quality, comfortable shoe. They provide good support and cushioning even for my 225# body. A good value for the money in my opinion."
118721,1,"It's hard to judge sizes with dance shoes, but Capezio recommends to order the street shoe size for this ballet shoe. My daughter wears a size 8 (toddler) in street shoes, but isn't terribly far from needing a size 9. I ordered an 8 & 8.5, since return shipping is free. The 8 fit her but it was tight and would be outgrown before the end of her dance class. The 8.5 was perfect, just enough room to grow to get her through."
23833,1,"These are comfortable, high-quality, attractive, and relatively inexpensive for how often you'll end up wearing them and how many miles you'll put on them."
26158,1,My husband has been wearing this exact shoe for years...we are sad that it appears to be discontinued and that finding a suitable replacement in his size ( 15 US ) is nearly impossible!For NB 991 lovers...get 'em while you still can! Reviews we've read on the replacement aren't very good!
317537,1,I looked high and low for this type of boot slipper. Deerfoams used to make them but apparently not anymore. When I wear sliipers I want them to keep my ankles warm too and these are perfect. I only gave four stars because within a month one of the pull straps broke. Otherwise I love them.
26330,1,"Aside from the old-school good looks, comfort, support, and style of the New Balance 991s, these are the unofficial shoes for prep school students and fraternity members. Wear them with khakis, a polo shirt, and a baseball hat (preferably of a large Southern state school - UNC or UVA is ideal).They are also ideal for use with contrasting laces - thick red ones are best."
20027,0,"This is a very light, basic shoe. Seems to run long. There is not a lot of arch support in this shoe."
36397,1,These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer. They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet.
225179,1,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
313659,1,This shoe is verycomfortable. It is nice to get these for $119. They were shipped quickly. I highly recommend this seller and shoe to anyone.
286782,1,"We purchased these black Capezio Little Kid tap shoes, size 1 medium, for my five-year-old son's first tap/jazz dance session this summer. Yesterday, he performed at the Ventura County Fair with his class of three- to five-year-old kids, and had lots of fun! The shoes are holding up well after six weeks of tapping, but there are two things you might want to know: 1.) the size 1 medium fits pretty snugly, and if there had been a size 1.5 available, the fit might have lasted a bit longer for my son -- since half-sizes weren't available, probably should have purchased a size 2, even though his sneakers are size 1; 2.) The taps seem to be of good quality but, like all taps, they are quite slippery -- his teacher suggested to parents that the kids should scuff up the tap bottoms on a cement driveway or patio, so that the taps aren't so slippery for the kids when they have to walk on the dance floor. This is a great tip, and something a new ""tapping"" family might not know!"
163820,0,"I bought these shoes to complete my cheerleading costume for a special event. They looked Great!Customizable: The color blocks are easy to interchange, they tie into the laces, so they stay well, too.Size: The shoes were very comfortable, and I found them true to size - I wear an 8 1/2, and I bought the size 9. As with running shoes, I find that you should always go up at least a 1/2 size to account for the forward motion, and they fit perfectly. There was a little extra room, as expected, but when jumping around in them, I found them to be great.Traction: My only concern was that there was little to no traction. This may not matter for your use of the shoes, but I was wearing them on a slick dance floor, and when someone spilled a drink, I fell pretty hard. If using on a track surface, grass, or other ""standard"" cheerleading materials, this may not be a concern for you."
159721,0,i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.
190351,1,Perfect and great price! Perfect and great price! Perfect and great price! Perfect for Charter school requirements and a great price!
230122,1,The shoes are very cool. And so is the price. Fast shipping also.
332069,1,"This year I bought 6 pairs of Crocks, love them all exeps this shining material of these Crocs Classic Clog,Cotton Candy,Women's. But I am happy because my gran child always ask me to wear these."
16504,1,You could spend $40 and be miserable and have absolutely NO TOUCH on the soccer ball.. or... you could spend a little extra money and get the best all around soccer shoe on the planet. There's a reason why year after year adidas NEVER changes this shoe... It's a classic and a must have for any real soccer player.
40638,1,Very comfortable! It's like they mold to your feet with use. I wear them all the time! Sandals were true to size.
259397,1,When I got the chucks I started to train capoeira and I felt like I was stylin and profilin wwwooooo
152032,0,"Let me first say that I like the looks of this shoe and it was very comfortable to wear but I didn't like the way it ""flip flopped"" when I walked in it. I've never worn mules before but I take it they're not supposed to do that? I ordered in my usual size and it didn't feel too large but it just wouldn't stay on the back of my foot. I thought about exchanging it for a smaller size or maybe not a wide width but maybe my issues with this mule make it best for me to actually try it on in stores first."
278597,1,"The ""Fours"" recently purchased are just as comfortable and supportive,right of the box-as were my two previous ""Fours"". My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them."
188106,1,I have these same sets but mine include the matching hat. I offer these at very affordable prices that can not be beat. They are so adorable and the pics really do not do them justice. Web addy is sugarcreekcollection com
357906,1,"Since I do not have normal feet (bunions and toes that aim outward) and I read that one reviewer had reordered a larger size twice for the perfect fit, I ordered one WHOLE size bigger than what I usually wear and they feel great! There's even enough room in them to add a Dr. Scholls pad. Getting them bigger insured that the widest part of my foot is right at the widest part of the shoe and I think that's what is critical to the comfort for me. I do not usually wear heels at ALL, so it will be interesting to see how they feel after I've had them on for a couple hours. But the quality seems good, so at this point I'm happy."
381260,1,"I have purchased this same tennis shoe for years now. It is very comfortable and roomy to wear in the summer months. As I like to keep my feet covered most of the time, I want something sporty and that is comfortable, this shoe applys to both. I could only find this shoe on amazon for a good price."
157365,2,"I ordered the recommended one size up. The toe box length and width is tight, but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose. A full size increase to a 9M from the size, which I ordered (8M) would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose. As other reviewers noted, these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable. The 3/4"" rubber raised soles appears adequate. As I write this review, my feet are becoming quite warm, after about twenty minutes, with my athletic socks.After an hour, my feet are roasting in these slippers. Would I purchase again? Difficult to say, if the toe box doesn't loosen up for comfort.01/25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse)with two pairs, which fit. My feet were never comfortable with this pair. Would not recommend."
263222,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
282508,1,"Love the style & quality of the boot, unfortunately it was little tight on the shaft. Had to returned them :("
248554,1,This was perfect.. It was true to size brand New as suspected and I would recommend this product to anyone
82489,0,"This shoe is stylish and looks good with a number of outfits, however the footbed is hard, the heel is made of shiny plastic. It is not uncomfortable, but to be blunt it is just not the quality I look for."
69750,1,These shoes are pretty comfortable - the only thing that is a drawback is that you better know how to walk like a model in the HIGH heel. One slip and you could twist your ankles...make sure you are on solid surface when you are wearing & walking in these!!
162569,1,i'm so so so glad i bought these shoes!! i love them! MAKE SURE you listen to the sizing advice!! i usually wear a 7.5 in womens..no bigger no smaller..and i ordered a 4.5 and crossed my fingers since they usually run a size small..and they're men's sizes. they look great! if only it wasn't a blizzard i could go out and wear them! i bought the chocolate with the blue toungue. SUPER CUTE! i haaaate wearing tennis shoes..i'd rather be barefoot all the time..but i was willing to compromise for slip ons :) love them! buy these!!!
304535,1,I've bought 6 pairs of Sambas since I got my first job. These shoes never go out of style and they are very comfortable. I will certainly be buying more in years to come.
66441,1,"I bought the green shoe. First, it's really good but I mainly run on the hard concrete so it probably wasn't the shoe for me.I can't tell you how well it works off road, but on the road, my knees take a beating due to the lack of padding. These shoes definitely weren't designed for distances of over two miles on the road. Right now, I mainly use them for sprint workouts which they excell at. They are very flexible and lightweight so it's almost like running barefoot and is excellent training for calf muscles.I haven't got a chance to use the spikes but without the spikes, they have traction on snow and ice due to the metal on the bottom."
292686,1,"Did exactly what I thought they would. Which is, be shoes. I am still wearing them and probably will continue to wear them for some time."
55525,1,"I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere. It's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps. But here, I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide, red. I'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more."
169012,0,"These are a throw away boot. They are toast after about 5 or 6 months of daily wear. I can buy these locally for half this price and for that price they are worth it (after I put in a set of decent insoles), but all in all these boots are nothing special."
8291,1,The quality doesn't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached. I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price. On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet. I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good.
304083,0,"Note very comfortable, need to find a cushion because toes slid to the front of the boot and rub very painful."
213067,2,I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out..however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off..very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
322641,0,"When I ordered the shoe I thought it was a good value. When we received them, they were the correct size but they were felt cheap and are way too wide. I think we are going to have to have the sides stitched so they will fit a lot more snug."
52193,1,"I bought my first pair of these flip flops 3 summers ago, and by this one they were kaput. I was so happy to find them again because I wear them nearly everyday. They are incredibly comfortable and even offer a bit of arch support which makes them better than so many other bargain flip flops."
28501,1,"Cute, pratical and STRONG. Don't get the imitations; pay more for the brand name which is far better. I've had 2 pairs for about a year and the mj's are fantastic--a great alternative to flip flops, beach, and for casual parties."
6768,1,"There is a world of choices when it comes to replacing one's favorite, but aging, boat shoes. I looked at a number of manufacturers and models before deciding on the Sperry Billfish Deck shoe. I really like the look and feel of the shoe. Better yet, the comfort is great and exactly what you might expect from a Sperry. I am very happy with my purchase and the shoe seems to run true to size and width."
309050,1,"I love these shoes. When I run in them, I am faster, my feet feel lighter but supported, and my knees hurt far less than when I wear any other pair. I just bought a lightly used pair of GK-13s and a new pair of GK-15s, and I picked them up because of how well the XIs have performed."
353436,1,"I bought this pair of shoes about nine months ago and couldn't be happier. Adidas sizes tend to run a little narrow, but if you know what size you wear, then this is a great price for a casual shoe. I've received numerous compliments on the style and had people ask me where I bought them and for how much. I'd say they're not really for sport--more for just everyday wear and to go with jeans. I'll probably get another pair in a different color when these finally wear out."
318876,1,For years I have only worn this type of Reebok sneaker. When I switched to a different brand that were not high tops I started having back and knee problems. Since finding them again my back is clearing up. I love these shoes and have at least 2 pairs...Black and White.
151331,0,It is so good to me. and size is also perfect. but one is error. good has scratch in logo 'N'
161031,1,"This pair of converse was just what I expected; they were one my son's Christmas presents. The colors available were more varied than those I'd seen in local stores and the price was better. This item arrived sooner than promised, too. Needless to say, my son was pleased."
119544,1,"I bought these shoes for my daughter a few months ago because we could not find them at the store. It was well worth the risk of buying them the wrong size because they are exactly what she was looking for. They don't look cheap, they're not noticeably dirty even when they are, and for a girl mostly importantly, is that they match just about any outfit. We can't find anything negative to say about these shoes."
275570,1,"I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
200272,1,This shoe appeared damaged (or worn) so we had to return it. Took a while to get return handled from marketplace supplier. Not a fan of sperry though - too boxy.
358934,1,"We travel to Sanibel Beach every May. It is famous for its shelling. Great, but not great for walking/wading in the water. The shells HURT! Saw a man fishing in Crocs and thought what a great idea. Waterproof, don't hold the water, protection against the shells. Like I said,Perfect for the Beach (and comfortable anywhere)."
377600,1,I think these boots are ADORABLE. I would have rated 5 stars but one of the studs came off immediately.The leather is very soft and I think they will wear well. I had actually seen the boots in a higher priced children's catalog. My daughter found them for me on Amazon.com at a better price. So I'm happy.
362353,1,These shoes are warm and comfy and perfect for walking or running to class (if you need to) I got them because I knew I would be walking a lot more and wanted something that went with a lot of different styles. people comment on them all the time and even my husband is super jealous and wants his own pair. they are awesome!
266034,1,"I am an EMT on an ambulance service. I have bought 3 pairs of these boots and plan on staying with them. They very durable and tough boots. I am in and out of mud, water, and other assorted ""fluids"" constantly and these boots never let me down. My feet are always warm and dry. In many shoes, in the summer when temperatures soar my feet will sweat; I've never had this issue with these boots. I love them!"
215825,1,"My first pair of sandals was a real vintage pair I snagged from an estate sale. They were too small for my feet but I wore them for years, they never broke, my parents had to throw them away because I guess they were pretty ugly by then.My newest pair was the white. The buckle tarnished quickly and the leather became dirty soon, so I will next purchase a darker shade.The suede on the interior lining (across the top of your foot), is going to blister you. I tried using a suede brush to sand it down a bit. This also helped with the evening out of the shoes, because due to differences in the leather one was hard and stiff, the other was soft.I also used these at the beach quite a bit, and the white color cracked. I tried to use white polish to fix it, but that ended up sticking to the brass screws on the side. Now they look pretty tacky. But they are easy to wear.Wear them enough to get used to them and you will find them to be easy to wear with anything, except maybe a formal dinner (but depending on your dress, u may be able to pull it off).The size is easy to figure out. I can't say I notice if they are slightly too big or too small. Make sure you tighten them up enough so that you don't step out of them, because that can cause some mega hurt, in my experiance. Also they may knock up against your nubs on the sides of your ankle.But all in all, these are the classic sandal that won't go out of style. They spoiled me and now I find it very hard to wear uncomfortable shoes, no matter how cool they look."
367316,1,This is a great shoe..... Very comfortable and well made..... Has a European look and great fit...... For the money you can't go wrong.....
199319,1,"I bought these shoes for Halloween to go with my Steve Zissou costume, and actually wear them all the time. They're so light and comfortable, I simply love them."
29251,1,"I love them!! They are extremely light, and the most comfortable pair of shoes I own, PERIOD even over my tennis shoes! I wear them 5 days a week to work, and usually wear them on the weekends too because of their comfort. The Zippered feature makes getting in and out of them extremely easy! I have owned two pairs, wearing them pretty much daily a pair lasts about two years. Then I wear the soles off of them! They are definitely non-slip and have great all terrain traction. I have been in all sorts of situations with them: muddy hills (they bite into the ground like a beast! I don't slide), Oily parking lots in the rain (in normal shoes the oil makes me slide all over the place)."
317917,1,"Love these shoes, very easy to slide off and on. My only complaint about the pair I ordered recently, size 6-7, is that the right shoe keeps unsnapping where the exterior croc logo connects to the strap. My son is constantly almost losing this shoe because of this issue. I think it's to late to return them or to ask for a pair that doesn't have this issue as I ordered them a month ago but just started using them a week ago."
321326,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
60910,1,"I ordered these and only the very next day the price went down by $20.But aside from that they have been a really good pair of boots.They had them in my size(15) which are hard for me to find.They arrived very quickly I believe within 4 days.Very comfortable,the only bad thing was that the laces only lasted about 2 weeks.I guess because the eyelets are made of metal."
29211,1,"I really like the way the shoe feels, I would have given it a 5 if it had better arch support (My other experiences w/ Propet they all had great support). The foot bed on this sandal is flat. It does not feel like it will pinch or give blisters. I have only worn it around the house so far to see how they will be."
89791,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
66593,0,"This is a great-looking shoe. However, this is no arch support, so it gets uncomfortable. With better support, this could be an outstanding shoe."
389829,1,Customer Service was quick to reply as well as very helpful. The item arrived fast and in perfect condition. Excellent service.
187174,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
41644,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
296790,1,MY FIRST PAIR OF CLARKS. THIS PAIR OF SHOES HAS NOW BECOME MY FAVORITES. LOOK GOOD WITH ANY KIND OF PANTS. I WILL BE A FAN FOR LIFE....
359949,0,"I got the shoes for a musical I'm in. The sizing is definitely weird. My street shoe size is usually a 9 or 9.5, so I ordered 9, 9.5, and 10. I also have pretty wide feet. Turns out the 9.5 fits fine and I had nothing to worry about. The ball of the foot area is REALLLL snug though, and I ordered the wide size. Hopefully they stretch out with wear."
38364,1,"I bought a pair these Skechers ten years ago and the soles were still going strong after all that time. They never got uncomfortable. The top leather started to break apart after heavy daily usage and I was worried that I would never find these shoes again. Much to my surprise Skechers still made them so I bought 2 pair just in case they stop making them in the future. I feel as if I wont need to buy new shoes for the next 15-20 years, not a bad investment considering the amount of money people spend on shoes in 2 decades. Buy the shoes, you wont be disappointed."
58771,1,"I run about 15-20 miles a week. I used to wear Asics but I decided to try a different pair since I was getting bad blisters in the bunion area ( I don't have bunion and my feet are rather thin). I tried about 7 pairs at the store and finally bought these model. So far I can feel the difference, I'm getting no blisters. The extra room on the sides is great. The sole feels soft. I totally recommend them. Worth the money!"
237384,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
185472,1,they are so confortable and so cool and nice too wear.i love them and i would buy 10 more if i could.
357486,2,I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them. They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them. I will not purchase any Keds in the future.
80138,1,These shoes are so comfortable that I would love to wear them all the time. The fit and support are perfect for long walks including over rough terrain.I wore the pink ones for a year and recently ordered a different color. The new ones aren't broken in yet but I have every reason to believe they too will be one of my favorites
131895,1,I have had these boots for awhile and I must say they are very comfortable and durable. You can't go wrong buying these boots.
171704,0,"I gave it a 3 star only because I was hoping to use it for regular walking but obviously I was wrong. For shoes to the beach only, I'd give it 5 stars. You can take the cushion out so it won't get wet. But walking on the boardwalk for a prolonged period might hurt your feet."
225578,1,"These shoes look good, they feel good, and they don't cost much. If you're feet are strong enough, you can even run in these (I do)."
187881,1,I have owned many pairs of this shoe. I have flat feet and bunions and these shoes fit my feet well and are so comfortable. I wash them in my washer and and air dry with a shoe form inside them. They are great!!!
17113,1,"Great shoe. I've been running in Asics for years. The shoes were shipped quickly, I'd buy from them again."
5221,1,"Came exactly as expected. Perfectly white and fit fine. It does get dirty easily but when wearing white shoes in NYC, that's expected. I'll probably buy again but in a different color. The only thing to note is that the racing stripe on the bottom is not blue, it was black."
76229,1,Very Comfortable. I have both the beige and black shoes.The inside is very soft and they have a wonderful padded instep.
274558,1,"These are my son's favorite and he swears by their quality. They don't fall apart like other brands he has tried and believe me, he is hard on them. He likes the fact that the soles don't come apart from the uppers."
384614,1,"Been using this boot for about one month now, it's comfortable goes on and off easy has good traction. as far as being durable I will have to wait three years and let you know. must of my bates shoes last about that long and I'm hoping the 5.11 will too so far so good"
152109,1,"I have never thought I would own such shoes. But when the shoes was offered for such a great price by Amazon I jumps at the opportunity. The color is not what I wanted or desires, however, shoe dye is less than $5.00. The shoes are great looking and a great bargain."
203720,0,"I ordered these for my 8 year old son. He was so excited he took them out of the box and tried to put them on only to discover that we were sent two left shoes. Now I am stuck with two left feet. Need to order a second pair, they say only one pair left in his size 4.5, must be two right shoes."
92456,1,"Was looking for a nice pair of above knee boots, but did not want to spend a fortune on them since they will only be used for pleasure more than going out. These did the trick, very nice hieght and they stay locked to your thigh very well, only problem is they iritate the knee area a little when bent but I am sure this will go away as they start to break in. Very nice boot though and plays the part well."
293468,2,"These were not comfortable for me. I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet, they hurt. I just have a really hard time finding shoes that don't hurt my feet and these were not them."
368212,1,I've worn these sandals all summer and they're great. What I really love is they have a little bit of arch support so you can walk in them forever without your feet getting sore and achy. Plus they're very cute. I've gotten tons of complements on them! And you can't beat the price!
21822,0,"They are rather tight for a medium width, and, although they are described as having a 1-1/2 inch heel, I measured the heel at 1/2"", the same as the Liberty Flat, which sells for $20 less. The low heel makes them less dressy than what I thought I was getting."
238389,1,"I'm a casual dancer, and I never go on pointe, so I got these just for comfort and looks. They're winners on both. Be sure you like lots of arch support if you're a casual wearer! I take a women's 9.5-10 usually, and the 11's are just right on me. Vegan Recommended!"
224207,1,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was &#34;dated&#34; in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
174067,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
73825,1,"I like buying crocs for my two year old and my three year old. They wear well and can take a beating! The price was right...I paid about 12 bucks for this pair, otherwise I would not have bought them. Crocs usually retail for about 25-30 bucks per pair and I would not buy them at this price. Overall a great kid shoe and durable."
236714,1,product received as was ofered. no problems with it and satisfaded with the order. also came on time as expected.
52609,1,"My mom has been falling down and lacks stability in her gait. Dr. told her to get a good pair of stable walking shoes and suggested a local retailer. We did visit and listen to what the retailer had to say and did a bit of Google research on our own. In the end, we decided on the Propet Women's W2034. Gave them to her for Mother's Day. She is very pleased with them and says they are very comfortable. She has fallen since we got her the shoes, but NOT while she was wearing them! Drink milk for strong bones and wear Propet shoes as not to be like Humpty Dumpty."
383772,1,"I have worn this brand for years, but the more recent ones are not as well made.The leather isnot of same quality."
251526,1,These boots are amazing! The most comfy boots I have ever bought and they are a great price. From the first minute I put them on until the end of the first day they have been amazing!
183488,1,I was very pleased with how comfortable these boots were. They have soft rubber soles with some kind of cushion in them. They don't make any noise when walking in them either! They have zip up sides which make them easy to get off and on. These are definitely the most comfortable boots I have ever purchased.
123795,1,"Bought a pair of these a couple months ago. The styling isn't too bad, but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later, before they get discontinued everywhere."
379853,1,"I wear a size 9 1/2,so just in case, I ordered a 10W in these shoes. They were shipped VERY quick! I bought these because I was doing an Oklahoma Play, and we had to have these kind of shoes. So when I tried them on.....OMG! The top of the shoe that goes to the toes made it to where I could not even walk! On the top of the shoe that goes to where your foot starts to show kept digging into my foot. Everyday, my feet would be very swollen and sore. I had to were these shoes every day, 6 hours a day, for a week. Then, I had to wear them in our 4 performances. As soon as I would get off stage, I would just stop and rip them off quick! It was just awful! My feet are still sore, and the play was a week ago! I tried to wear them a lot so that the top would stretch, but nada! I know that I will NEVER wear these shoes ever again, so I am just going to resell them."
10349,1,"YAY! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged, so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway. Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness. No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel! these are the best and i will always buy these."
123657,1,"When someone says Tracy Mcgrady, what do you think about? His signature T-MAC shoes (the originals), The T-MAC 2's? I think about my T-MAC 3's. I think that they look great, feel extremely confertable, and are great for playing basketball. The shiny exterior in not really made of real leather (synthetic leather)but it still breathes well, and the stripes add to the signature T-MAC shoes. the insides fell like wearing a pillow on your feet, but for the first few days it hurts really bad until you stretch the sole to fit your foot, and the back has a strecthy piece to fit your foot perfectly. another downside is that if you get them wet, they stay wet for a while. The bottoms herringbone design is specially formed to grip the floor with it's best ability. The reason i give it a four is because they stay wet for a while, hurt your feet for the first few days (but then there REALLY COMFORTABLE) and after walk in them for a little the shell exterior bends to a funky design fitting your foot. I have to recommend these shoes to any basketball players though."
94150,1,"before i bought these i had one pair of birkenstock sandals that i occasionally wore. i bought these because i wanted a slightly more polished looking pair of summer sandals. my feet are a pain to buy shoes for. i have a high instep, wide feet, and metatarsalgia. these have been awesome! it took a few days of wearing them to break them in, but now they are amazing. i've been pretty much wearing them everywhere and getting tons of compliments too. they are a great shoe for anyone, but especially those who are often doomed to other comfort shoes that look like you're wearing comfort shoes."
270864,1,"I am so happy with these boots. The seller sent them on time and are just as they said they would be. I tried them on and can already tell they are high quality and the kind of boots I can wear all day. I would say if your thinking about these boots. Don't hesitate, their great!! Love them."
238001,1,"Softsports provide comfort, style, and quality. Individuals can always be confident in buying softsport products, and are always a great value for the price."
132760,1,I recently purchased a pair of the Reebok DMX Walking shoes while on vacation in nothern California. I have a pair of New Balance 842 Walking shoes that I normally use but I left them at home. The Reebok DMX Max Walking shoes have been a pleasant surprise. They are comfortable and have the feeling of walking on air. They were also about half the price of my New Balance 842s. I did considerable walking while in northern California up and down hills and on flat land and my legs really never got tired. I now use them at home over my New Balance 842s. I normally walk 3 1/2 to 5 miles a day.
168764,1,"My wife has feet that hurt a lot. She chose these sneakers based on all the positive reviews. After wearing them for only one day, she declared these were her all time favorite sneakers! Thank you, Amazon for offering the best prices!"
44766,1,"I previously owned a pair of these sandals (over 5 years ago) which I really liked, but for some reason they no longer fit confortably. I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels, but more casual, loose fitting shoes. My new sandals fit beautifully. I can wear them all day long in complete comfort. I'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too."
191173,1,"Naturalizer Scout ShoesI have been looking for another pair of these shoes for years now. Not carried in our local stores. I didn't know they still made them. I had two pairs which I wore until they wore out. I will be ordering more, so keep them stocked. I hope they keep making them! I have feet that are very hard to fit, so that the Velcro strap helps. So does the design and comfortable heels. But I mustn't praise them too much or you'll be all sold out next time I want to buy a pair."
347476,1,"My husband is an almost exclusive low top Converse wearer. He has been wanting a pair of TRUE red not TOMATO colored chucks. These are a true tradition red and he loves them!!! Great price, better than any I have found in stores and they fit like a dream. Highly recommend these!!!"
276188,1,"I bought my first pair of Altitude IV's in late 2007. I have worn them nearly every day and they will keep you dry in the Heaviest Morning Dew; they have held up better than any throw-away pair of High Top Sneakers. I still use them and was considering another pair. My original pair from here was $42. Why have they nearly doubled to $76.43 in 3 years?!? Even through a marketplace seller, I'll pay half again what I gave before. They raised the price another $10 just this week to the current price.Hi-Tec certainly delivers a quality product and I understand some increase with time, but a quick Froogle Search reveals that you can find them cheaper elsewhere."
121112,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
277575,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
139242,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
268308,1,Thank you! Quick service and just as described. Perfect fit!
144164,1,i love them they are so comfortable. i wish i had ordered another color. the best boot ever bought. great
136112,1,"I Like this Converse Shoes. They are very nice. I will buy again when the need comes. Get it, you will not be disapointed."
147179,1,"These boots were a gift for my daughter for Christmas. They came quickly, and packaged to withstand gale-force winds. The boots are well made and warm. I would suggest buying waterproofing to keep them nice. She loves them. The cost is a bit much, but the workmanship looks great. Also, watch the sizing. I was told they are cut large. I ordered one size smaller than she wore and the fit was perfect."
179164,1,A great shoe with a classic look. These are nicer for wet days than the canvas and are lasting longer. They look great & are well made.
209901,1,I thought this was for older people with functional range issues. Not! I have a pair of UGG boots that have narrow opening. I use this to get into my booties. O my! No problems whatsoever!
271435,1,"I've worn this shoe for almost a year and I couldn't be more happier with it. It's light weight and grabs the floor like no other shoe I've owned and for the price, it's a great buy. I'm so happy with it that I just bought my second pair due to the first being worn out. I play squash and volleyball about 5 hours a week total so the shoe has held up well. A few guys I know are also on their second pair of these and they are more than satisfied with Asics quality. I'm sure the Rocket III is just as good, but why mess with a good thing."
290690,1,This is the original! (Rubber soles) Rockport changed the production to a injection moulded model now in stores which is inferior to the original.Thanks Amazon. This is a great walking shoe.
327539,1,"Good traction, and you can feel where your foot is in relation to the ground. The laces are secure and don't flop around.Very good product."
181184,1,"I love these shoes, they fit well...love the strong make and nice style of the shoe. I would recommend this shoe to anyone, and to add to that i think i will be getting another pair, different colour of course."
298394,1,Not warm enough for 20* or below. But comfortable and well made. Great boots overall great for snow and stalking hunts.
178221,2,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
363552,1,"Who doesn't love a good pair of Chuck Taylors? My manfriend and I are huge fans, so I scooped him up this blacked-out pair for work (he is a bartender). Not only do they look good, but they are holding up magnificently, showing little signs of age, despite all the mixers, juice, and other bar sludge that they see on a regular basis. And because of the canvas, if they do start to smell like the floor of the bar, in the washer they go! Pricing and delivery on these bad boys was on point and I would not hesitate to get another pair from this distributor again.And, if you do not own a pair of Chucks, get on the wagon and buy a product created in the USA, my friend."
213072,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
284310,1,"I bought my first pair of ""Berkies"" while in college many years ago. Wore them continuously and was able to purchase and apply replacement soles from the Birkenstock shoe store in my college town. My second pair lasted 20 plus years with episodic use. I became interested in wearing these sandals again when my son came home from college wearing a pair. I pulled out my old, well broken-in sandals and found them to be comfortable but the soles had lost their tread so walking on wet surfaces was dangerous. I had no problems getting replacement soles 30 years ago so I figured that with the internet it would be even easier now. NOT SO. It appears that either the German corporation or the US distributor has determined that this practice of supporting the individual consumer must stop. One can buy these soles on line but only if you buy enough to operate a cobbler's shop! I found a local cobbler and Birkenstock dealer who advertized on his website that he can repair Birkenstock sandals to ""as good as new"" but he flatly refused so sell me replacement soles. He does excellent work but he charges $95 to renovate a shoe that he sells in his store for $130. I find it hard to justify repairing a 30 year old shoe for 75% of the cost of a new shoe. I really like supporting local businesses but, sorry, sometimes it does not make economic sense.I love my new Sandals, adjusted for inflation the price can't be beat. They will take a while to break in as always and the sole will eventually wear down. If Amazon starts to offer for sale single replacement soles I will buy them and keep this pair for 20+ years too. Maybe my local cobbler will wake up and provide what the customer wants if Amazon gives him some direct competition. If all I want is a sole that I can glue on myself- let me have that. It is not too much to ask."
283904,0,"I have been wearing these sandals for the last 10 years, and have just bought another pair. Unfortunately the back strap that goes around the back of your ankle is now shorter than the back of the heel of shoe making your foot jut forward and hang over the edge of the sandal. I will now have to wear them in at home for some time until the leather strap at the back is long enough to allow my foot to sit in the sandal properly. Rather disappointing that the manufacturer has made a mistake."
169764,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
186502,0,"I ordered the product in my normal shoe size. Unfortunately it was painfully short - at least a full size too short for a narrow foot.So I think 'No problem - Amazon has a great return policy'.I fill out the return form online, print the RMA & send 'em back.But Amazon does not include mis-sizing as a 'reason for return' on the RMA. Since the decision to return the shoes was just my own choice then Amazon does not reimburse for return shipping.I guess it really doesn't matter though. Two weeks have gone by since I returned them and there has been no sign of a refund anyway.My last three orders have been jacked one one way or the other (only one of three pieces delivered on one order - 35 days to get the complete product and the other product listed in stock - two weeks and it hasn't been shipped. the part that burns is that Amazon just has this lackadasical attitude ""... too bad - whatever"""
227033,1,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
94821,1,"The shoes I purchased for my wife, were nice. Good fit, nice padding inside, and a excellent value. They are from Hushpuppies."
321310,1,These are the classic ballet slippers from well-known Capezio. They were slightly loose. You may want to order them a half size smaller than usual. Love that ballet pink!
193727,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
251837,1,I ordered these boots online and I loved them. The only reason they didnt get a five star was because I tried on a size 8.5 in the store they fit so I ordered a 8.5 online they are not the same. Sizes seem to run smaller.
11486,1,Super comfy boots from day 1! NO break-in time which is an added bonus. I've had many compliments on them. They DO run true-to size. Shipping was faster than predicted :)
162626,1,I just couldn't ask for a better pair of shoe than this. The fit is perfect. The leather uppers are just a jo to behold. They have remained shiny and clean the past 6 months that I have been using them. I am just hooping that French Shriner could come up with more shoe styles to choose from. Also this particular design doesn't come in saddle brown nor tan. Wish they'd make more colors of the design. Just love it!!!
58042,1,"My new keds are so awesome! They look exactly like the picture. I am so happy that I got these. They are comfy and stylish, and when they wear out, I will buy from amazon!"
160233,0,I liked the shoe because of it's support to my ankles but it doesn't do to much if you have flat feet.
146791,1,LOVE IT!! Packaging was perfect and product is perfect. Highly recommend product and vendor. Hope you enjoy the product and are successful with the vendor as I have was with this purchase.
4080,1,these boots seem to be made well and they are fairly comfortable. The Hi-Tec boots have decent reviews and with a size 16 my options were limited.
309610,1,"I'm a flip-flop and sandal lover. When I need to wear real shoes and socks, I grab these. They are comfy."
160607,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
60507,1,"I've worn my previous pair for hiking in California and the Swiss Alps, in rain and shine, and my only complaint is that I would have liked a more rigid sole for the rougher terrain. Other than that i can't fault the comfort or durability. I got the second pair because although the first has lots of life left, I would hate to have to look around for something this good at this good a price again!"
148341,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
215549,1,"I bought this pair of shoes about nine months ago and couldn't be happier. Adidas sizes tend to run a little narrow, but if you know what size you wear, then this is a great price for a casual shoe. I've received numerous compliments on the style and had people ask me where I bought them and for how much. I'd say they're not really for sport--more for just everyday wear and to go with jeans. I'll probably get another pair in a different color when these finally wear out."
383018,1,"I work as a nurse and had a pair of these about 8 years ago, I am wondering why I ever tried any other shoes. They are great for messy days and running around the unit. I will never try any other shoes again!"
175382,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
4670,0,I have 2 pairs of them. These are very comfortable and will continue to buy them because of the comfort.
5396,1,These shoes are the best things I Bought on amazon. I recomeend this product who wants the real converse. I love them and now i wear them everyday and everywhere i go!!! I cant wait till i buy or get my next pair!!
367967,1,"I'm a long time fan of the Aerosoles 4 Give style. They don't seem to be carried in stores as much any more but I'm glad they are still available online. Perfect summer style - casual and comfortable but dressy enough for work.I liked the Lizard texture, a nice variation on the standard black.I'm an 8.5M and fit was fine for me, no issues as commented on by some of the other reviewers."
59782,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
218331,1,"Why doesn't anybody state that they run full size large? Maybe it's not even worth mentioning as everybody knows that, but I've never had experience with Converse before. I bought those in size 10 (men's) for my brother (he always wears 10) and they are big even for my husband (who wears 11). Other than that they are OK, good quality."
203006,1,Glad to get some of the last available of the 754's. They were good shoes. I hope I have the same success with the next New Balance model I get.
87889,0,"I purchased these for my grand daughter when she starts ballet classes. While they arrived quickly (Prime), I was disappointed to see that they JUST fit her even though we ordered them a size bigger and extra wide. I guess the Chinese have smaller feet?? Yes, I pick on the Chinese,,,,,, for good reason.Anyway, the shoes are really cute and are functional so I can't complain about that. She looks good in them."
368578,1,"I am loyal to this brand, they outlast most others. Best of all, the cushion on bottom doesn't get flattened, or shaped to feet. This makes them durable and lasting longer with comfort."
150643,1,Why is tax being charged on an item less than $150.00? Locally there is no sales tax to be collected on shoes under $150.
178917,1,As always converse well never let you down with these silver boots! I love tham and use them all the time!
235428,1,"I've owned various colors of this shoe over the years. They are classic and comfortable. They feel a little tight when you first try them on, but they always stretch to fit your feet like a glove. Great shoe!"
46872,1,"very comfortable to wear, easy on and off. hold up well would purchase again."
362482,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
43338,1,"The entire ASICS-GT line from the GT-1000 to the most recent GT-2120 are by far the best value for runners!I used to wear Nike, until I read in Runner's World Magazine that the ASICS GT-1100 was the Editor's Choice for best overall running shoe, so I thought, why not? In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar fasciitis(a.k.a. really sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish. I've been a committed Asics devotee since.I own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the GT series - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two except for the price. Also, there is not much difference within the GT series. I've owned GT-1100, GT-1120, GT-2110 and GT-2120 - all are superior. So, find the style and color to suit your budget - and enjoy comfortable running to your heart's content (or until you rack up 300 miles, after which you should replace your Asics as all running shoes start to lose their support and stability after around 300 miles. FYI - many local track clubs have programs in which they collect retired running shoes and donate them to impoverished children and adults. Spread the Asics comfort! Because though the shoes are no longer optimal for running after 300 miles, they still make great ""kick-around"" shoes and are cute and fun for casual wear. Sorry about the digression...If you run short or medium distances (&lt;30 miles per week), this is the shoe for you."
71705,2,"They are a little stiff, should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in. Not very comfortable."
316319,1,"Good shoes, nice soles. However, when I put them on, I actually can't tell if I have them on the correct foot or not."
152367,1,"I wasn't a fan of the usual rainbow sandals as they felt like planks of wood lined with a leathery coating strapped to your feet. But when I found these online, they looked much more comfortable. Luckily, I was right. The sole forms with your foot and gives you much needed padding and support. Great sandals!"
22053,1,These were my second pair of Dr. Marten's and as with the first pair they fit great and are comfortable right out of the box!
210810,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
160731,1,The ordering process was easy. The wait was not long. The product was perfect!!!
72514,0,"The shoes are very cute, but they are very narrow. Also if you have real legs and actually have some calf muscles you are going to have a problem. I have to zip the boots up and then pull them up over my legs. Also they scrunch up about the bottom they do not have a nice sleek look to them."
110540,1,"For the price I am very happy with these boots. They are easy to pull on and off which is very good!!! I walk a half mile to my deer stand with these boots on, they fit very well, and are comfortable to wear hunting. Rubber boots can be a little cold, I do wear thick wool socks with these boots. I wear them all the time hunting no matter the weather. I would recommend these boots to anyone, they are half the price of other boots!"
385965,1,"Don't trust anyone who says these shoes are not made for running, They are either not a real runner or too young to know what they are speaking of. These are classic New Balance shoes simply styled after the days when long distance running in the western world was at its apex The 70s-early 90s. The reason they may be marketed as ""sneakers"" is simple. Todays rage is minnimalist running which in plain terms is as close to bare foot as you can get. Having tried this after running extensively for over 30 years I can assure you this is for the most part a fad that will result in far more injuries that P.R.s. Companies will always try to market the newest rage as ""the best"" at least until the next rage comes along!Ask youreself if you owned New Balance and could market running shoes for 200 dollars would you rather hype that or 60 dollar shoes that arent as high tech. It doesnt mean they don't work, just not as trendy. I examined this shoe thoroughly and there is no reason it could not be used to run up to several miles per day. If you run more than that and like classic styling I would bump up to a 990 but the price is much steeper. This shoe is modeled after the classic NB 770 The highest tech running shoe of the late 80s a shoe I owned ran thousands (yes thousands) of miles in including a 24 hour race. New Balance shoes were always famous for great comfort, padding and soles that wore out after a few hundred miles and needed shoe goo. But they always blew away Nike Brooks Asics in runnability. These should be no different. Would I run a marathon in them? No! would I run 3-6 miles in them Of Course! thats 30 plus years of running speaking. I'll put it up against any of these reviews. Thanks NB for making classic shoes again!"
58551,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
125334,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
360472,1,"These cute dance shoes were just perfect for my daughter to wear in an upcoming musical at her high school. Luckly her friend ordered them prior to us, and took other reviewers suggestions to order a size up to heart. My daughter wears a size 8 usually but a size 9 in these fit perfectly! We were lucky to have her friends shoes to try for sizing before we ordered or I might have gone with only a half size larger. She states they are comfortable and easy to dance in. I recommend these just be sure to order a full size larger!!"
323789,1,"Great product, good service, very comfortable shoe. I would highly recommend this merchant and plan to use them again when I purchase more shoes."
113797,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
245306,0,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
4216,0,"I'm on my third pair of these. I wore out the first two on my daily 3-mile walk. Now, one year into these, the left boot has started to crush my left big toe as it flexes when I walk. There is still plenty of sole left but I'm afraid I can't wear these again. I have really liked this particular boot for hiking and walks but I'm afraid I'm going to have to look for something else to replace it.2013-01-23: Update. I didn't wear these for a couple of weeks and then I tried them on a 3-mile walk tonight. They were JUST FINE. My left foot must have just been sensitive for some other reason which caused the problem described above. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again when these wear out."
350008,1,"These are the most comfortable money can buy,and I have tried many.The last one's I had lasted over 4 yrs."
204167,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortably, and look awesome. I was skeptical at first, but ever since I have received my pair of Red/White/Blue, I have not found a single flaw. These shoes will bring the old school back into your life and then some. Get a couple pairs of these things and wear a different color each day!"
175173,1,"I have always found this particular brand and styling of shoe comfortable. I probably should have purchased a wide rather then the normal width. But overall I am generally very happy with this shoe, just need to wear thin socks and I hope they break in quickly. I have purchased the brown ones in the past and they seemed more comfortable for some reason on the inside (???)!It's been a number of years though since I purchased this type of shoe. The only thing I can think of is perhaps the materials are slighty different now. Just seems ALOT stiffer. Where as the previous ones felt so comfortable right out of the box."
200248,1,"Top-Siders are the most comfortable (right from the first time you put them on), long-wearing, and versatile footwear I have ever owned. This purchase went easily and exactly as expected from order to payment to delivery."
271823,1,"I bougth it for my 23 years old son, he told me they are great and they are so comftable."
176795,1,"My grandson inherited his dad's foot problems and requires expensive shoes for foot support. These shoes are perfect for him but not as expensive as some of the other shoes we've had to pay through the nose for... They look good, fit perfectly, and give him the required support he needs...."
8704,1,item returned as too small. sizes are too limited to waste my time with.either restock or get rid of the item
153179,0,These were bought to replace ES slip ons I've been wearing for a while. It was easy to tell the quality was not as good.
265108,1,"Quality boot, it's just like the discription states, no surprises. Rugged enough for work and good looking enough to were out. Quality boot, would buy again."
77666,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
378934,1,"Although these aren't much to look at, they definitely make up for it in the comfort department! No break-in period required, they are incredibly lightweight and comfortable. I was afraid that my heels would start getting blisters, but nope! Not even after 4 hours of dancing the first time around! And I've been dancing in these for about 4 months now, very practical and durable. I wish I ordered one with a higher heel though. Also, spinning isn't as smooth because the heel is a little thick, but again, these are so comfortable! Order your normal size; I ordered 1/2 size up based on other reviews, and they are a little long for my length, or maybe it's just my feet. Sizing just gets so subjective, so just stick to your normal size. But because of the strap, I'm able to keep them on, so no problem there (and I really didn't want to deal with the return process, so there you have it, lol)."
332522,0,"I love the shoes; nice looking and comfortable. Unfortunately, the size 10.5 shoes I ordered are too small for my feet. I even went to a shoe store and sure enough, I am still a 10.5. My other size 10.5 shoes fit fine. I did get a pair of 10.5 shoes from LL Bean which were also small. I think I will give these shoes to the salvation army and shy away from ordering shoes online. I am curious to know if others found these shoes too small."
160603,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
120723,1,"The materials used to build this shoe give it a very roomy interior. If you generally hover between two sizes, I'd suggest the 1/2 size smaller.The exterior material is weather resistant, but it is an odd texture if you are used to leather, suede, or canvas.Bottom line, this is a shoe that is very unique and urban. It fits slightly large and my only complaint is that I am not in love with the material. I would recommend this shoe, overall."
160254,1,Shipping was fast and free!!!! I was so amazed at how fast this got here! I Recieved my shoes 3 days after shipping... they are very comfortable and cute and go with anything... DEFINATELY a great find! =]
173854,2,I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago. The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small. I sent them back and got a refund.
370498,1,I am very pleased with this purchase... Shipping was prompt and smooth...Not everybody can handle a 5'' heel...but this is what I had been looking for... I'd definitely buy from this seller again!!!
258095,1,"I had these in white for a job 10 years ago, and actually still have them. I decided to get black this time, and I, too, had trouble with the squeaking. The baby powder under the insole trick is magic. I only had to do it once and there has been no more squeaking at all. I am a veterinary technician and wear these shoes all day, and also on a 30 min walk on my break. They are so comfortable! A bonus for me is they are also bleach proof. I use a lot of bleach and my leather shoes showed it. I can drop straight bleach on these and there's no mark at all, amazing! Got rid of my $100+ shoes and am definitely keeping these."
361999,1,"This is my 3rd pair of AP1 Easy Spirits - each pair lasts from 2-3 years at least, and I have to walk ALOT for work. These wear well and are very comfortable! I hope Easy Spirit NEVER stops making this type!"
355852,1,"I have been using these shoes for salsa and tango dancing since last year and a half. They fit perfectly well and have been a great companion for my twice a week dancing nights.They have nails struck into the heels and they can be very slippery on a smooth floor. Dancing shoes are meant to have less friction, but nails do not serve that purpose. Also the sole is not very strong, so if you dance for a long time, your feet might ache. But they are the cheapest shoes I have ever bought and hence I cannot complain much.If you are just beginning to dance, these might be the best choice, once you know your steps you can graduate to better ones."
181756,1,"Being that i have arthritis in both my feet, it is hard to find a boot, that i can get on espically a waterproof boot. the side zip makes it easier for me, and with less pain. I have worn "" ROCKY BOOTS"" for many years. they are virtually waterproof, and have awsome grip on slick surfaces. Thanks amazon. And at a great price"
109455,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
50662,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
107099,0,I purchased these in a 7.5 wide but when I got them they didn't feel like a wide shoe even though that is what it said on the box. Better to buy shoes in person I guess.
325572,1,"These shoes are wonderful! My husband got me two pairs for Christmas (black pinstripe & grey) and they are fabulous. They do run slightly big, but they are very comfortable for all day wear and they are very sexy!"
139739,1,"I first bought the MX1008 New Balance shoe not long after they came out. My feet did not get tired in them. I was able to walk farther. I was heavy and these helped me to exercise more then I was before. They were not to soft which makes your legs hurt. At least if your in your 50's and have things like arthritis , and diabetes. And also not to hard. And they are not to narrow in the toes and not to loose. They are just right. Then they stopped making them and came out with all the new ones in last several years. None of them are even close. So when I seen these I bought them and yes they again help me to walk longer and feel better. I thank you, and my feet thank you. I hope you keep trying to carry these shoes."
105117,1,These and another pair of Roper's I purchased are so very comfortable and I wear them to work (I'm a nurse) very styish & recommend for everyone!
99483,1,"They serve the purpose that I got them for.. I keep them near my table tennis table and slip them on to play. Comfortable, can move well in them."
308864,1,came in a timely fashion. Just what we wanted. Just wished they had been a little bit wider.
195330,1,"Like the style and comfort. They last for quite a while with some beating. On my second pair now. Don't use the bottle opener often, but it's nice to have in a pinch. Just make sure you don't step in anything unsanitary before using it..."
383993,1,"Easy Spirit Women's AP1 Sport Sneaker,White Leather,9 M Thanks, the shoes are nice and the service was great. Amazion is the place to shop."
304919,1,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat.I received 2 pairs of nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat White.when requesting the colour on the order form, you have 2 options for wheat. The option for Wheat White is not separate from regular wheat.I am now stuck with 2 pairs of the wrong colour. I live in Ireland and therefore would be very expensive for me to send them back to you.I am very dissapointed with my purchases. Unless you can rectify the situation for me I will not be recommending your service to family and friends.Thanking youRachel Costello"
319643,1,I've worn Hush Puppy Mall Walkers for 20 years ( on feet all day ) and they are really comfortable shoes.
318789,1,This is a very comfortable shoe. Not stiff and lighter weight than it would appear. I purchased a wide width and it fit very nicely.
325167,1,"I had exchanged size 9, the usual size, as they were just a little too big. Apart from that they're great."
283862,1,"This is a great sandal. I bought a pair and they are still in service half a year or more. Although you do not want to get them wet, they are great even without socks. As far as I know everything on this sandal is leather except the the bottom sole. They fit smaller than true size. I bought this 7.5 and have to bring it to the last size hole because I do have a wide foot. I bought 7.5 wide, so they run small. I had previously bought 8.5 on sale and it fit better at first. After getting them wet they will stretch. Overall this sandal has no bod points and I will buy over and over until they don't make them anymore."
314713,0,Boots are fairly comfortable but the sole seems too thick and they look cheap made.
285853,1,I purchased these shoes for my 93 yo grandmother. She loves them. They have good non slip soles and she says they are comfortable.
182,1,"Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
7836,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
46320,1,I bought these in black at a store in Chicago and found them to be incredibly comfortable. When I saw Amazon's amazing price I bought them in brown and white. They look great with pants and skirts.
218074,1,I get so many compliments on my chuck taylors' they bring back the good old days and so comfortable!! I wore these when I was a kid!!
197181,1,I've used this stretcher on a number of cowboy boys with great success. I like to buy older boots of higher quality and they are usually used. I have a wide foot and many of the boots are an average width. With this stretcher I can make those boots fit my wide feet perfectly.
294813,1,"These socks are for shoe size 12.5-5. My son is a size 5. I bought these for him for soccer. I think they will fit for another year, even if his foot grows. Currently, they fit over his shin guards and fold over below the knee about 2.5"". If he grows, the fold will be smaller, but that's OK. I love how these came in a huge variety of colors, so I could get the color that matches the league jerseys. My son said, ""They're fuzzy. I like that,"" when he put them on for the first time. I don't think they're fuzzier than other athletic socks, so I'm not sure what he meant. But, he's happy, so I'm happy. These are a great price for 3 pairs!"
122821,2,I usually don't review products but I had to tor this one. ITS THE WORST SHOES EVER. it ripped after 2 weeks. my knee started hurting like nothing else. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Its low low quality product.
344834,1,"Twice I have ordered from Luskey's and twice I received the boots well packed, shipped with no dents.Only thing, wished I had an e-mail they had been shipped and when to expect delivery.I will certainly order from them again!"
72896,1,"I have 10 pairs of Crocs! (I couldn't decide on a color.) I teach elementary school and at the end of the day when my co-teachers are complaining of aching legs, my legs aren't even tired. My students love that I have a pair to match nearly every outfit. My husband is a surgical tech and wears the closed Crocs (no holes) in surgery. He's on his feet 8 hours straight and and he loves his Crocs. We have a 21 yr. old college student who is embarrassed to admit how much he likes them. (He says they're ugly, but very comfortable.) Our five year old loves them because he can put them on by himself and we can hose them off when they get muddy. (He climbs while wearing them and has never slipped!)We all wear our Crocs while camping, hiking, boating, fishing, gardening, and working...the best discovery since chocolate!"
114239,0,I thought these shoes would be perfect for a wedding...I think I expected them to be just little flats and not like a slipper. A little dissapointed.
111644,2,"20 OctThe leather is fine; so is the style. However, I got an 8 1/2 wide Naturalizer Women's Fuller loafer and the shoe is wider in the heel than toe. The heel looks bulky and slides even with adhesive pads inside the heel."
24507,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
77424,1,I bought these shoes for extra support for my feet during pregnancy. I'm a stay-at-home-mom and I spend a lot of time running around the house barefoot or in flip-flops. That quickly became painful and I needed something comfortable for my feet.These crocs have been fabulous. My feet haven't hurt since! I wear them all day long. I've worn them doing shopping at the mall. I've muddied them up outside working in the yard. They clean up great! I just rinse them in the sink and dry them with a towel. Pretty easy!We're in hot summer weather right now where I live and my feet do sweat in them some. The texture on the inside of the shoe keeps them from getting slippery on my feet. And rinsing them off every couple days keeps the shoes odorless.These not the most fashionable shoes in the world. But I wanted comfort and versatility and these do those two things very well! I will definitely buy this brand again.
276341,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
382118,1,"My husband has severe arthritis in his hips, knees and back. This has been so handy for him and me! He is unable to bend over to get his slippers on and it's next to impossible for me to help him. With this, he can do it himself. It seems to be very sturdy. We don't worry about it breaking. Great price for a handy, dandy little item!!"
267777,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
152122,1,"I received my Keen's in about 3 days. I loved the fact that I paid no sales tax or shipping! They are the best summer shoes ever! I wear them kayaking, hiking and going to the grocery. They look great with workout clothes or even jeans. I don't know how I lived without them for so long."
122766,1,This is the only shoe that I can wear that does not hurt my feet. I have Morton's Neuroma's and have a lot of feet problems.this shoe takes away much of the pain.
162595,2,"I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES!! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26, AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES??? I'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK!! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR (WITH LACES) AT A BETTER PRICE."
50501,1,"I ordered these boots two days before Halloween and when I got them I was really happy with them! Great, sexy, and fun boots!"
103458,1,I recently purchased these shoes for my dad as a christmas present. They are very nice shoes and a great color.
301305,1,"I ordered these for my husband,, he only likes laceless slip on with hopefully a comfy arch and non slip and this shoe has it ALL. I gave it all stars cause we had looked everywhere for a shoe so similar, although he would have liked a deep brown color or black but he has had no complaints.. and he is a very very picky when it comes to shoes... he couldn't get over this price.. he usually will spend around 180 or more. So this was a 'just try it' kind of thing and now he only wants this shoe."
369112,1,"I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago, and they are still in great shape and look brand new! They may not be the most-concious sandal, but I love wearing them for sports after I get off the field or as comfortable weekend shoes. They are incredibly comfortable and the foam kind of forms to your feet. I was going to get a new pair- but realized I didn't even need to because my first ones are still great! Highly recommended!"
73674,1,"I own two pairs of the Softspots Tela, and wear one or the other to work practically every day of the summer. They're soft and cushiony. Could do with a bit more arch support, but I can live without that. Get this one instead of the enclosed huarache - it's not as padded. This one is great for wide widths!"
65505,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
24865,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
190724,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
170566,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
329370,1,I love these sandals-they are my favorite! I have a lot of Tevas but I think these are the best!
46170,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
345812,1,"All-Stars, Old School, Awful. Delivered in France, in times.Amazon's the only place where i can find huge shoes size.First purchase, definitly not last."
80767,1,"My husband loved them. Make sure to buy a half-size smaller than you usually wear, as they do run large."
334556,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
89316,0,"The sandals are listed as ""Betula Licensed by Birkenstock"" but the sandals as delivered are ""Basic Newalk Licensed by Birkenstock"" and they are made in China. My old Betulas don't say Made in China. We'll see if these last as well as the Betulas."
163122,1,So glad they make them in a size 16.. I do wish there was a larger selection to choose from but after size 13 the selections naturaly dwindle.
156008,1,"The Rockport Margin Oxfords are my favorite casual shoes. I purchased them in black leather after purchasing the espresso nubuck style. The price one pays is extremely reasonable given the quality of the product. Quality in both the design and the aestetic aspect. If you are looking for a very comfortable casual shoe and want a classy traditional oxford style, look no further than the rockport margin oxfords -- you will not be dissappointed. I have bought the same shoe twice over and I am extremely content."
229310,1,I got these boots when i was working this summer in the woods not ideal for that but they are comfortable especially to wear if your standing on cement a lot.
108869,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
96015,1,I just recently started getting into climbing and bought these shoes as my starters. I love them! Even though you have to lace them up its ok. They arent to rough on your feet and can be worn with or with out socks. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who is either just starting out or has been going at this for a while and needs a new pair of shoes. Perfect fit.
35090,1,"I got these shoes to work catering wedding events on a recommendation from other servers at the events. You are all your feet all night/day and by the end of the night my feet would hurt so much, it would travel to my legs and back. I got these shoes and wore them right away to my first event and was amazed. They were very comfortable, didn't take a lot of breaking in. Good if you are on your feet all day. Almost every other person working was wearing a pair."
82412,1,"Love these sandals. Pricey, but they last forever so it's not hard to justify the price. My feet and knees feel great in these even after wearing them for hours at a time."
345839,1,"Normal chucks...awesome as always. I've worn them for the past 2 years. They're looking a little worn now, time to buy another pair. :)"
347247,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
115442,1,"i love these shoes, this is my 4th pair and my second pair from amazon.com, i love them and i can't find the good colors in stores but amazon always has every color ever made so i always have endless options."
180994,1,Vert comfy - but I would suggest a half size to full size larger if you are not fimilliar with such bodacious heels - they make your legs look KILLER!
194281,1,Great moccasin. I love to walk around the house in them. They keep your feet nice and warm. I have several Minnetonka moccasins but this one is one of my favorite because of the soft soul bottom. I was a little skeptical about buying soft sole moccasins because I didn't think they would last long but I've had these for about 2 years now and they are holding up very well with just walking around the house and to the mailbox occasionally.
323307,1,Comfortable and relaxed once the boots are worn in. I usually wear size 11 shoes and reviews recommended to go one size smaller. I ordered 10.5 and they fit great. After researching the Internet Amazon.com offered the boots twenty dollars cheaper than the Frye's website.
169867,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
328258,1,"I have never tried these moccasins before, and I need to rave about them for a moment. They are very comfortable, and beautiful to look at! They conform well to your feet, and the suede is very sturdy. About the sizing, I was very scared to order a size too small. I went with an 8, and I am usually an 8.5 or 9 in womens. The 8 is a perfect fit, with about a quarter inch to spare. Although this is the first time I have ordered them, it is definitely not the last!"
56137,1,"I had forgotten how much I loved my ""sneakers"" back in the day when I routinely wore Keds. Now I am in love with them all over again. Great shoes!"
61671,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
169139,1,"The boots were beautiful, but were too small and I had to send them back. I did not re-order another pair."
132004,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
6093,1,I purchased these for my mother and she was happy with the color and the size. Thank you very much.
334764,1,I am 67 years old and have worn these type of shoes most of my life. I started with Hush Puppies and then switched to Wallabees when they first came out. There is a place where you can have them resoled if you wish. Wallabees are highly recommended by me but of course they are not for everyone.
71710,1,"Found the Trailmeisters on sale for $40 and at that price they are a real bargain - probably wouldn't pay twice that price though as I can usually find something comparable from Columbia for less. These are great light-to-medium duty hikers that can do double duty as casual sportswear as they are attractively styled without being too flashy. I am a slightly wide 11 and the 11 in these fit just fine. Plan to do a little breaking in to get them to the optimal comfort level before hitting the trail for an extended hike, though the break-in period didn't cause any undue discomfort. In my experience one ought always break in hikers before committing to the trail to maximize enjoyment and to make sure there aren't any fit issues. I have owned many Columbia hikers and they are built to last. All in all these are winners - good support, solid construction, and comfortable."
306458,1,"Brooks are good shoes..My favorite are Sauconys hands down,then Asics, then Brooks...Id feel well protected in these shoes but i can tell the variance. ounces different , seem like bricks sometimes compared to a lite weight shoe... like the look"
190817,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
252564,1,"Crocs, I've found, are something people either love or they hate. I happen to love them and have numerous pairs in many colors. I've reached the stage in my life where comfort is a priority. I truly have never found a more comfortable shoe. All the written and other media articles about safety on escalators are overblown, to my mind. Accidents with these shoes always seem to involve children who are likely standing too close to the edges of the escalator stairs. I've ridden many escalators and have had no problems with any of my Crocs."
241501,1,"Already have Chucks in white, which I wore for the b-ball team in high school...yeah, when Chucks were the shoes to be wearin'!! Decided to re-live days of Sandlot Black PF Flyers with the magic wedge, make you run faster, jump higher! But when I got them, they were about a 1/3 size too small and the shoes felt uneven (one bigger than the other, both still tight). Thought I could wear them in and couldn't. Chalked up to a loss. Paid less for black Chucks and they fit true to size! Love these black Chucks! GREAT PURCHASE!!Wonder what the difference is in the monochrome black. Anyone know?"
165730,2,"I was very disappointed when I received these boots. They are now made in china (not too surprising guess) and made out of the toughest piece of leather ive come across.They were rediculously stiff, even for a new boot (I have several other pairs of leather boots lace up and non and none of them were as bad as these when new)Overall I would not recommend these boots, you can order the english made ones else where Id try that or buy a different brand"
328434,1,"Good traction, and you can feel where your foot is in relation to the ground. The laces are secure and don't flop around.Very good product."
300268,1,These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air. I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase). There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.
92290,2,I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling. These are not it. They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters. I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them. No such luck
288425,1,"I bought this shoe in August of last year. I have worn them for about 300 hours, most of that time spent standing and walking, and walked many miles in them in all weather and all kinds of pavement. I guess the wear I put on them might be a little above average. I love the fact that a $70 dollar pair of shoes is of such high quality, has a leather sole, and looks so good. My only complaint is that after a year of wear, the soles, especially the heels, are wearing very thin. The leather heel is very soft, and wears down to the wood very quickly, which looks a little ratty now. It's not too bad, and if I find a cobbler I'm sure I can get that taken care of, but it is an annoyance. I highly recommend these shoes, but don't expect the soles to last more than a few months of intense wear."
245344,1,However I liked the style of the shoe. Will order the right size in future.
52021,1,"My husband has plantar fascitis. His heels were hurting him terribly. He is on his feet all day at work and we had tried every over the counter insole available, and, a custom made orthotic insole that actually made the pain worse. We had tried Nike, New Balance, Propet, Dr. Scholls, and Reebok shoes and didn't get any relief with any of them. These Spira shoes in a wide width (E) provided relief. The problem isn't entirely healed, he still experiences pain daily. But I have absolutely no doubt that if not for these shoes he would not be able to work right now. He has been wearing them for about six weeks and I can't anticipate ever buying another brand of work shoe for him. Will probably invest in a pair for everyday also."
25674,1,"I love my Naturalizer Perth sandals so much that after I got them in white, I started searching everywher for more in other colors. I now have three pair of these, and they are the most comfortable shoe I own."
376357,1,These were a gift for my son in law. Came just as promised...he loved it.
66878,1,"great product, just as advertised. The item was purchased at a good price and the shipping was fast. I would purchase from this person again. they come highly recommended.thanksusm1975black"
284593,1,"Awesome product!!! I purchased this for my husband for valentines day. He had looked at the shoes and was not impressed; however when I surprised him with them- he loved them! He thought they looked great, felt great and what a great bargain! In fact all of his golf buddies were impressed and wanted to know where he had gotten them. The quality of the actual product far excedes what the picture shows. They are true to size and are of superior quality and workmanship. Thanks for a great product. The sandals are awesome as well!"
321005,1,Shoes do not fit my feet well but provide great support and wear comfortable. The bottom is a little slippery after several times.
326476,0,"These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use. There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles. I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same. On the positive, they are true to size. I wear a size 8 and they fit."
346452,1,"This is the classic Converse, basic black sneaker. They fit fine on my wide feet, and they have them here in half sizes and in women's sizes.They're a good price here and you can't go wrong with the black/white basic Converse sneaker. They're good for mom's, teens and kids, both male and female.The only drawback might be that they lack arch support.I would recommend this shoe to anyone except someone with really flat feet."
318611,1,"I have been buying this size and style shoefor many years... Increasingly, it is not instock at local outlet stores... glad you stock it."
265627,1,"For the money, I don't think you can buy a better hiking boot. In fact I think these boots are a great buy even at full list price. At least for my feet, Hi-Tec boots have always been long on comfort and durability. I've had these boots for several years and worn them for hiking, birding and general outdoor stuff. They're great for keeping your feet dry crossing streams or walking through wet grass. They require little if any break in. There's really nothing wrong with the laces that come with the boots, but for just a few bucks I prefer some good round boot laces on them. For me these are easier to tighten and have a more substantial feel."
68070,1,"Fit is very good and thick sole adds to protection. Love the look and hope they last. Will come back in a year and let you know,"
286335,0,Very nice shoe but nothing grate nor outstanding. I ordered by my exact shoe size and it is a very tight fit.
339379,1,bought these for my wife... she's been wanting a pair of low-cut red chucks for a while. Ordered these for Christmas and they came quick with no issues.
288212,1,"These are great sandals! I bought some last summer and haven't been able to locate them locally, but fortunately they were available on the Internet. Love them! One of the most comfortable sandals I have found."
24179,1,I have had these boots for two years now. I love them so much that I have ordered a pair of tall ones for those extra messy days. I never have wet feet when I ware these!
114835,1,"I have always had problems with shoes fitting. These have been the best shoes I have ever had. I have problems with my left foot after tearing all the ligaments, these have been a life saver."
294693,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
331368,1,in South America the native people used to coat their feet with rubber tree sap and bake it on next to the fire to walk across the mountains.Crocs are that awesome without all the bother. get some now.
177642,1,"good quality leather. sturdy work shoes, and very comfortable. great non skid sole."
229177,1,This item was a gift. It was received in time for Christmas 2011. received in great condition. The shoes are super comfortable and very stylish. Great buy! 2 thumbs up!
121592,1,"i bought these sandals after i found out at the beach party they had a bottle opener built-in..yes a must have. then i realized that they were very comfortable and you can walk in these all day with no back pain,for me this was fantastic! i recommend to all to have the comfort and the fun! Great product!"
59285,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
55228,1,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
150932,1,"I LOVE these boots; they are very warm, and VERY comfortable. I bought a pair for myself, and my son. They were received promptly, despite the Christmas season. I would recommend this seller, and these boots."
383631,1,Very comfortable and cute shoe. I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size. I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look.
279038,0,"From the picture, the style of the shoes looked good. But when arrived, the style was too squared. It is still comfortable and good value for the price. However, make sure you like the style first before you buy them."
310039,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
302728,1,"I have been wearing Clark Sandals for many years. They are a product that has always lasted with quality. My latest pair that I purchased through Amazon.com are they same good quality that I have experienced when purchasing them from retail stores, but far less expensive. I am very pleased with this experience. Thank you."
44264,1,i just started dance classes.. this are very nice. comfortable. went with just about everything i wore. i have then 6 months and holding up very well.
79267,1,"the only problem i had with this shoe was the sizing, i usually wears 8 or 8.5 but the size i bought was 5.5 so it was a little bit unusual!!!"
80278,1,"my son bought these with his own money and we were disappionted to find out the sizes run very large. Wasn't made very well, sides began falling apart. Wouldn't buy this one again. Did arrive quickly."
108022,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
310857,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
147069,0,When I took them out of the box they looked okay. I threw the box out but when I put them on last night I noticed that the fronts were scuffed a little. The packing was not in the two shoes. This is my fourth pair from amazons and was never disappointed. If I order again from amazons I will check more closely before throwing out the box.
39248,1,"Not only is this shoe sexy, it's comfortable too! I had to loosen one of the straps on top of my foot then I was good to go. It's hard to believe such a tall shoe would be so easy to wear, but this one is. I have high arches, but the shoe did not interfere with them at all. You will enjoy this shoe for all it is!"
218310,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
127528,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
55759,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
222564,0,"This is my third pair of this style sandal from reef. The other two both died because the strap tore out of the outside of the sandal. I bought another pair because they fit my foot better than any I've owned before. Size 14M. I've put a lot of miles on the previous pairs I suppose, being in Florida and walking my dog in them adds up.As far as comfort, they are ok. When I say it fits my foot, it holds on well, there is no slipping or sliding. They dont even ""flip-flop"" too bad compared to others. But comfort-wise, severely lacking in front foot support. The padding on the front is non-existent. The heel support is great, but I find the front half of the foot to be lacking.So I bought these to wear as my casual flips, for short durations / dressier occassions(yes you can have grungy flips and nice flips, in Florida especially). I'm trying out teva's now for longer walks/better support if I'm out at events or walking my dog or whatever.Hope this helps. Cheers"
359817,0,"I like the shoe--takes time to break in so shoe begins to fit the mold of your foot, like all Capezios. Comfortable. Really bought this shoe for everyday wear, since I like taupe to elongate your leg and foot. Makes you feel like a dancer!"
176271,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
161914,1,I love these shoes! I didn't have too wait long. My hubby wants some too =)
190592,1,"I bought these shoes in hopes of having comfort at work. And they are wonderful. My feet tend to run a little wide and I found these shoes a perfect fit. I wore them 10 hours the first day and was on my feet a lot and had no discomfort. They are dressy also, look great with dress pants."
48691,1,Great quality running shoes.My son is a distance runner and all we buy are Asics for practice. They have amazing support.
194801,1,"Having lower back problems, I find that Clarks provide the support I need. I can slip in and out of them, so I don't have to bend over to put them on, and they last forever... my original pair has to be 6 or 7 years old and they still look like new."
115266,1,i gotta love these shoes they fit so nice and comfortably. Skate shoes are the best type of shoes.
351884,1,"This is the second shoes I bought after happily using the GT2150 for a while.It offer comfort and solid quality, will not bent in the middle after you use it for a while like some other brand.Breathe good and no smell after a long day wearing.Use it for walk, run or work."
358373,1,"I wear a size 9 1/2,so just in case, I ordered a 10W in these shoes. They were shipped VERY quick! I bought these because I was doing an Oklahoma Play, and we had to have these kind of shoes. So when I tried them on.....OMG! The top of the shoe that goes to the toes made it to where I could not even walk! On the top of the shoe that goes to where your foot starts to show kept digging into my foot. Everyday, my feet would be very swollen and sore. I had to were these shoes every day, 6 hours a day, for a week. Then, I had to wear them in our 4 performances. As soon as I would get off stage, I would just stop and rip them off quick! It was just awful! My feet are still sore, and the play was a week ago! I tried to wear them a lot so that the top would stretch, but nada! I know that I will NEVER wear these shoes ever again, so I am just going to resell them."
15659,1,I Bought this shoes for my baby and they are great...good choice and good buyer
360379,1,"These shoes are really comfortable! I usually wear a wide shoe, and I ordered a whole range of sizes in wide, but I ended up going with my street shoe size anyway. If you have wide feet, these shoes are wonderful in wide! Even if you don't usually wear wide size shoes, I imagine if you ordered wide, you wouldn't have to order up a shoe size. In any case, I recommend ordering a few different sizes to see how they feel. I've worn them to several 4-hour rehearsals now and I love them!"
360302,1,these are great and fit true to size...not too high for dancing...color is close to skin and blends nicely with my leg
32980,1,"I would have given 5 but I have been buyer these for a long time and I feel the quality is falling just a bit. If a manufacturer in the US would make something as comfortable and as nice looking, I love this style I would buy them as I really hate the fact they are made in China."
226193,2,I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother. The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it.
367202,1,"We really like this dryer for the speed in drying work boots, but you have to make sure you put each boot on opposite sides so it doesn't tip over! Good quality and much better than the last one we had for kids boots as well!"
222986,1,"This boot is absolutely perfect for stomping around town. The leather is super soft and the laces will accomidate a larger calf. It does run about 1/2 size small. I usually wear a 9 1/2 but got the 10 and it fit great!The picture on amazon is wrong. The boot pictured for ""dark brown"" is in fact the brown suede. The dark brown is a beautiful smooth leather color.It's not that dark (about the same color as the suede but slightly darker and smooth) but will go with most leather belts. I love them! think I'll have to get a pair of the black ones too."
333632,2,"When I ordered the shoes, I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order. It did not, so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund"
321983,1,"This is a great product. The boots fit great straight out of the box. The distressed leather gives them a vintage appearance and the leather is soft and comfortable. There are ""flaws"" where the leather sole meets the rubber - you can see the tool marks from where the leather has been trimmed down. These marks are barely noticable and give the boots a great hand crafted look. A very good buy - the best boots i have ever purchased."
263729,1,Great product! it looks great on my daughter! Birkenstock's products are always a slam dunk!
91400,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
36018,1,"Terrific combination of comfort and stability. Even better than the Acadias I purchased years ago, albeit for a different purpose."
256605,1,These boots are wonderful! My Husband gets the most comfort out of these! Love them.... You can work in them and wear to Dress them! great boot.
181703,1,I'v been buying these shoes for years. I love them. They fit perfect every time. I use them for casual dress.
152634,0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I've owned these shoes for several years and they have been among favorite casual shoes. Although the uppers and outsoles have held up remarkably well, the sort of honeycomb midsole has disintegrated - the material has basically turned to what appears like ground coffee, making them unwearable. I don't know what caused this; they're not worn constantly nor are they worn in wet or other extreme conditions. I'll probably try to contact Clarks to see if they have an explanation or an offer of adjustment."
177625,1,These are like a sneaker/tennis shoe hybrid. The soles are thick and the material is lightweight. I have bad knees so I was looking for something stylish and comfortable to wear at work and these fit the bill perfectly!
231530,0,Sized small.. Little toe on left foot hangs out No way to get full foot into it. This is my third Olowahu Flip FLop. The first was great and lasted forever. The second was like this one. Wore heal down in 3 months. Small Little Left Toe wont go into shoe or stay there if forced. Tore my little toenail back attempting to wear. I love Teva but wont buy another pair of these.
237741,1,"The color is beautiful, just as seen on my screen. The color is also somewhat neutral so that I could wear these sandals with many outfits/colors. The design of the straps is very elegant and summery. I love sandals with heels of this height because I get the benefit of a more sexy leg without the discomfort I experience with higher heels. The straps are also very comfortable and do NOT cut into my feet (even though I have rather wide feet). As for size, I got a size 8 and feel it is true to size. Definitely one of the most beautiful sandals I have ever worn."
142821,1,I bought the Asics Gel Nimbus VIII a few weeks ago and I've used them three times. They have a comfortable feel and I've enjoyed running in them. I usually run 3 or 4 times a week and average a 4 mile run each time out. Someone who runs similar millage will find these to be a good running shoe that will be comfortable to run in. This is the second time I've purchased this model and I had a good experience with the first pair as well.
11475,0,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
321429,1,"I bought these for my daughter for rehearsal/performances when she is not dancing pointe. There are better quality shoes out there, but for the price, these are perfect."
169862,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
344384,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
376132,2,"I have had these boots for about 2 months (working 12 hour shifts) and they are still as stiff as the day I got them. Make a funny squeeking noise when I walk. Got the ""wides"" but still seem to be narrow."
35048,1,Second pair of danskos I own and I love these one. They look naturally broken in. I've splashed them with water too and they don't stain.
269698,0,So far I have always been very satisfied with all my purchases from Amazon and this one is very good
260892,1,"While I'm not the one wearing them, they certainly are attractive and classic in style. Build quality appeared good. We are actually going to laser engrave on the side of the canvas part to customize for a friend. They will be Supah cool!"
317991,0,"Beware if you're buying size 1 for kids. Instead of sending a Junior size 1 that should be listed as J1 (I called the crocs company), they sent a M1/W3, which is a men's 1/women's 3. It is incredibly wide and NOT the same thing as a kids 1. I was very careful not to select the M1/W3 choice and yet it switched and sent that.This is not a big kid size for a 7 year old...just for a very small adult."
214119,1,"I really liked these boots. They look stylish on and they are warm and secure in the snow. The fit was great with room for socks. I wore them for several hours and they were comfortable and good in the snow. I did spray the boots with waterproofing because I didn't know if they were treated for the snow. Good buy, price was appropriate for this boot. Good job Bear Paws!"
114492,1,"If you're new to purchasing dance shoes, make sure you go to the manufacturers website to check their sizing! Buying dance shoes is NOT like buying street shoes.We checked the sizing info, and saw that these dance shoes are comparable to street shoe size, so we opted to getting 1 size up. When the shoes came, my daughter tried them on, and they were just what we were looking for. There was just enough room in the shoe for her to grow into as the dance season progresses. The shoes are very well crafted, as most Capezio brands are, and the fit all around was great."
46810,1,"I bought these shoes about a year ago, when they were on sale. I just love them! My 2 1/2 yr old son can put them on by himself and, he looks, instantly, sharp!My only regret is that I should have bought the next sizes up for him, while they were on sale, so that he could grow up in these shoes for a few more years.They are easy to open and put on.The toe is wide enough that they do not pinch.Sturdy soles.Easy to clean.Versatile.My son wears these to church, family get-togethers, and light play. Have had them about a year and, they still look like new."
287768,1,"The boots fit great and there was no ""break in"" necessary, they were comfortable right away. No problems with the zippers coming down while wearing or riding. I like the ease and quickness of the zipper while putting on or taking off. Would be perfect for those with flexibility problems or big bellies :)"
376655,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
206456,1,I purchased these boots in brown for a friend of mine. He really liked them. They are true to size. I also ordered him a pair in black.
270643,1,"Got these for my boyfriend, he loves them. He is usually a size 14 or 15, I got him a 14 and they fit him well."
186464,1,"I bought these for my son last year and he has gotten so much wear out of them! After they arrived in the mail and he opened the box, he didn't want to take them off for a week! He wore them through the summer, fall, winter and spring again until he grew out of them. They are still in great shape and hope to pass them along to another child. Kudos to Western Chief for making fun designs and sturdy boots for kids. We're now getting the race car ones in the next size up (size 9). They are great for rain (even snow-for short trips wearing warm socks), especially after the rain when your little ones want to play in the grass and mud and you know their sneakers will be filthy - put them in these and just hose them off when they're ready to come in! My son could easily put them on himself with the handy loops at the top! I wouldn't put him in these if I knew he was going to be running all day - since sneakers fit the foot better for that, but for trips to the park or even shorter walks and lots of outdoor play, they are great... (just not for doing a lot of running.)"
73066,1,"I love these shoes. They are comfortable and durable. My feet do sweat a little in them, but it is summer time. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the left shoe the strap will not stay forwards. As I walk in them it slowly comes back and rides funny on my ankle. I have not contacted the company about this."
112709,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
317531,1,"I received them several days earlier than the estimated time, that is really nice. I read the reviews and ordered an 11 size, I normally take a 10 or 10 1/2, the size is just right, Thank You to those who suggested a larger size.I think these slippers are almost perfect, they are warm, they breath so my feet don't sweat, they stay on my feet while walking around, and are made well enough to wear outside to feed the dog or get something out of the car, I'm not sure though how they would be if walking through wet grass because of the outside material (maybe spraying then with some Scotch-Brite would work), all in all I recommend these and will certainly order another pair when necessary.The free fast shipping is excellent too.Edit on this purchase: After reading the comments I ordered a larger size but after a short while of wearing them they do stretch. Because they are so comfortable and wear so well I will be buying these again when I need too but I will order my correct shoe size, that is my experience. They are wearing quite well, I have been wearing them everyday around the house and outside for almost three months and they still look new."
354743,1,My 23 y/o son asked for these for Christmas and he was ESCATIC! He loves them so I guess this would be a positive review! Shipping was fast and came in great condition.
93300,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
370474,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
289138,1,I bought these for my grandfather. He said that they are very comfortable. These were for a great price considering that this size is hard to find and usually runs about $90 or higher.
70630,1,"I am a Keen fanatic and had been dismayed by their lack of styles for summer until I came across Isabella.They are not at all like the other Keen clogs I have. These have a much, much wider toe box and a lower profile. They are much more like Earth brand shoes than regular Keens. Order 1/2 size smaller than you normally would as they run rather large.Very comfortable."
215002,1,"Beautiful, High Quality, Reasonably Priced Boots. Delivered quickly. Would buy a thousand times over, but have a feeling these will last me awhile. Trust the people saying they run a half size large."
331699,1,"I get a pair of crocs for each summer visit to Hungary--the treads last about a month of hard walking on cobblestones.Then they are 'retired' for home use. I find they stay on my feet, are extremely comfortable, provide excellent support for my high arched feet. I only need to take this one pair of shoes--note: shoes are removed when you enter someone's house so neatly groomed toes are more important here. Also, if it gets cold or rainy, it's quite possible to wear a pair of fleece or wool socks with the crocs so feet stay warm (even tho' wet). Only quibble: the croc color that I have found most usable/attractive is their 'Gold'. They haven't offered it in a few years. When they do, I'll buy a bunch!"
149433,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
268544,1,My daughter lives back east and really loved these - warm and comfortable inside with a rugged sole that lets her wear them outdoors (i.e. taking out the garbage).
363817,0,"I carefully went over all the details before I ordered this pair of shoes. Hi tops - check. Size 7.5 - check. White - check. Chuck Taylor - check. Everything seemed excellent. That is, until I opened the box (which arrived just on schedule by the way). By some mistake I had received a pair of very nice looking low tops. Which would have been perfect if that was what I'd ordered. Now, the shoes have been sent back, and a new pair is on its way."
380127,1,"My first time wearing them I thought I need a wider pair but then the second time was better and so forth, I truly enjoy my shoes. They come a half size bigger, remember that when ordering : )"
108465,1,Very confortable slip on I trully recomended as well as the seller. The item arrived in great conditions.
140885,1,"I have never owned a pair of original exercise sandals from Dr. Scholl's before, so when I tried them on, I was happy how comfortable they were despite the wooden platform. They are adjustable to fit wide feet such as my own, and the arch support is comfortable as well. I developed a blister on the side of my foot from it rubbing on the leather but for the price of $14.00, I guess I should not complain. This is a good quality shoe."
73700,1,"These are really sexy boots with a great, flattering shape. The heel isn't too high and is perfect for my height. I've been wanting these boots for months and they were unavailable for the longest time!!! But once I saw they were available I jumped and bought them and am happy I did so!!"
2718,1,It was good enough for the work it was required to do in a reasonable manner and at a very low price. Not the best though of the more expensive products out there.
359093,0,"Bought it only for the brand. I have used more comfortable slip-ons. Also the color of the product which actually arrived is a bit different, a bit darker and duller than what you see in the picture."
270063,1,"I have owned many pairs of prowalkers over the years. I currently have a black, brown and white pair. I purchased these to replace the white pair I have had for several years. The pair I replaced were still in serviceable condition but had lost their shine. I am very pleased with the new pair. I see no noticable difference in quality over the older ones. They were very comfortable out of the box. I delayed writing this review for a few weeks to give them a good workout. I would not hesitate to purchase another pair and probably will be replacing the brown pair shortly"
270399,0,"If you have wide feet be sure to ask for one wider size the least...I always try to buy 2E but in this case I had to be 4E because the first few uses before break in they were a bit uncomfortable, after that, they are OK."
214854,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortably, and look awesome. I was skeptical at first, but ever since I have received my pair of Red/White/Blue, I have not found a single flaw. These shoes will bring the old school back into your life and then some. Get a couple pairs of these things and wear a different color each day!"
290887,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt.

3623,1,"This is a great boot. I have worn them most every day for two years, winter spring summer fall. They are great in the snow. My feet have never been wet and I don't think they have been cold. The only problem is that after two years they still look great so I don't have a good excuse for buying another pair."
379774,1,Great product. More comfortable than they used to be and they seem to be very well made. I recommend this product
332779,0,"I am a Croc addict. There, I said it. BEWARE!!!! Crocs Classic and Crocs Beach have completely different sizing. I wear a W9 in Classic and they all fit like a dream. The same in Beach looks like duck shoes. Huge. These shoes in yellow were not available at this time in the Classic style, so I took a leap. The wrong one. The shoes were returned and my credit was issued immediately. No problem with the shoe or seller, it wasmy fault, but the sizing needs to be standard across all sizes. As far as the transaction with this seller, it gets 5 stars. Crocs themselve get the 3 stars. Will still buy more though!"
185009,1,These are my mothers shoes. She really love them. Don't hurt her feet at all. She has worn these kind of shoes for years.
185926,0,"I ordered these boots because they say they are 12"" but they are really 10"". They are also made from thin leather."
354772,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
384241,1,"This shoe is so comfortable from the minute you put it on--no breaking in is necessary. They are attractive and wear well and last a long time. This is my second pair and I only got it because my original pair is over 15 years old and looking a little ragged to wear out in public. I don't normally pay this much for a pair of shoes, but these will surely pay for themselves over time. Get a pair, you won't regret it."
146828,1,These boots are fantastic and so comfortable. They were a great investment for winter. I would recommend them very very highly.
367552,1,"I bought these to replace an old pair I had, they are great shoes and hold up well. I generally use them to work around the house but they are good enough to where as a casual shoe anywhere."
201601,1,"I bought these for my father, not for myself. He had purchased a pair of these exact shoes almost ten years before at a local store which had then closed. He wore them EVERYWHERE. When they were new, they went with business casual AND jeans, which he loved. He always said how comfortable they were. As they aged, eventually he wore holes in the bottom and his toes stuck out the front, and he STILL wore them! We couldn't find another pair of shoes that he liked as much. Finally, I knew I could find them on Amazon and bought a pair - he was THRILLED!! And *I* was happy to finally throw the holey ones in the trash. I'll be buying him a pair of these every few years now. Thanks!! P.S. Nice to be able to find LARGE sizes!!"
105839,1,"Very quick and easy, description was perfect. I went and tried them on in the store first just to make sure of the size. I usually where a 7 or 7.5 in most shoes, but wear a 6 in these.Delivered faster than expected!All in all it was a great deal!"
152990,1,Uggs are always so comfy. My feet are always so happy in Uggs. The blue is great with jeans. The best
48187,1,Wish I had bought more shoes arrived in just a few days. Super buy. Great product you just can't wear them out!!!
174753,1,"This is a great shoe, one of the best I've ever purchased. This shoe has it all, comfort, style, and fit. If you have a wide foot or a high instep, this shoe will still be comfortable on your foot. This is a great shoe for anyone who has to be on their feet for long periods of time. It looks especially nice with jeans or other causal pants."
18730,1,"Shoes are about what works for you. These work. Light, lots of vents, and completed a half and a full w/o abnormal pain."
267276,1,"I have been buying these boots for the last 5 yrs they are great. I buy a new pair in the late fall and use them for around the house and out and about during the winter months, then I cycle them into my work boots during spring and replace them the next spring. They stay waterproof with no care taken and the soles do not split away like a lot of boots do, at work I 'am outside a lot in all kinds of weather snow, rain, and bitter cold they keep your feet warm in winter and they are not hot in the middle of summer. I highly recommend these boots, people are always asking what kind they are and the answer is Hi-Tec Altitude IV! (And no I do not work for Hi-Tec) but support any company that makes a great product."
380106,1,They fit perfect an work like a charm!!! I am glad I got them fr here because they were cheap and still in good shape
176959,1,"I've been playing soccer for my entire life and at last I've found a shoe that doesn't hurt my feet after a game.Very good traction , beatifull design and very original model.Thank you ADIDAS."
388950,1,"I bought this item for my sister, who lives in another country. She was very happy with the purchase."
20028,1,"These shoes have great arch support and are incredibly comfortable. I usually buy these in brown, but got black so that I could also wear them on formal night on a cruise ship and casual Fridays at work. The shoes are stiff at first, but get broken in after about three days. The last pair that I had needed new cushioning inserts after three years and the laces frayed after three and a half years. The tread is still in great shape. It just needs some polish on the toes to cover up where they get roughed up from kicking things. I like buying them on Amazon because of the lower price and that I can get the narrow width that local stores won't carry."
102079,0,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
30218,1,My husband bought these slippers for me. The slippers are like walking on a cloud! They are soft and cushy. The only thing I would tell you about sizing is they are a tad short. I wear between a 7 1/2 and 8 womans shoe. I ordered an 8 and my foot almost hangs over the back. I have a wide foot and the width is good. I would recommend these slippers!
130047,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
339430,1,"I love Converse and this is my ninth pair. Not of the shoe of the same color though. I'm fairly meticulous about taking care of my shoes so all of the ones I own (some for more than 5 years!) still look brand new with moderate wear. They're comfartable, durable, versatile, and flat out cool. Go buy them if you've never owned a pair!"
143185,1,"I love love love these comfy, durable summer sandals. They're perfect with skirts, capris and shorts. I have them in several colors and wear them daily."
34427,0,"The pair I received ran about a full size smaller than expected. The quality appeared to be good, but I could not get it on my foot."
326937,1,"I live is flip flops year round! These are perfect! They match everything, offer arch support and are snug yet soft and comfy between my toes. I walk a minimum of 1 mile every day with a double stroller and and my back never aches with these!"
34759,2,"I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair. However, I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs (all dark colors) and they all dye my socks. They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs. I returned the shoes (black and blueberry colors) and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue. The inside is light brown. That too does dye my socks, but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned, but be ready to see your white socks black."
116693,1,"Sweet and pettit, these are the cutest little ballet shoes I've ever seen. Perfect for any budding ballerina. Great for dance lessons."
125028,1,"These sandals are very comfortable and I am very pleased with this purchase. Shipping was speedy. I do feel, however, that the size ran a little small."
235116,1,"Comfortable, modern, light, great grip on asphalt, marble, linoleum. I like this shoe. Better than the Hush Puppies oxford that was too narrow and had too rigid of an outer sole. Fits my feet well. Warm in the winter time too."
282079,1,"I bought these in order to have a pair of quasi dressy shoes in my wardrobe. They are very comfortable and have plenty of room in the toe box for your foot to spread out. The more your wear them, the more comfortable they get. That and you get that worn in look which is also pretty cool. A great shoe at a pretty good price"
237687,1,"My daughter has what you would call a &quot;Princess&quot; foot. She is super fussy about her shoes. Has to fit just so and no fabric rub or discomfort when she walks. She also has a hard to fit foot. Narrow heel and wider toebox. Thus shoe shopping for her can be a chore!Recently she picked up a cute little strappy dress for summer and I mentally prepared myself for the hours she would spend finding a summery sandal to go with it.When we went to the shoe store they had a large display of Dr. Scholl's in an assortment of colors.I remembered Dr. Scholl's from my teens. They used to sell them in the drugstore.The look is timeless and she instantly fell in love with them. Because the strap across the toes is adjustable they fit her toebox comfortably. And because they are backless, they are light and breezy for summer and there is nothing in the back to cause foot discomfort.The hard part was selecting the color. The sandals come in a variety of fun colors including pink, black, tan and more. We settled on the blue. Great with jeans and a nice shade to compliment her summer dress.Because the sandals feature a wood finished bottom and contoured footbed for arch support they are sturdy and comfortable.Price is right too when you consider they will last for years and remain classic in styling.Picking Dr. Scholl's is easy. Picking the color is the challenge!"
65619,0,"I was trying to replace a previous pair of Clarks that I adored, but despite looking exactly the same, these fit in a very strange way. Shipping and condition was great, but I had to return the item."
31090,1,"I almost always wear a size 13 shoe, and as such, I ordered a size 13 for these. They arrived, and yet they're a size or so too big, which I found strange.As for the shoes themselves, I do rather enjoy them. They look nice, slip on easily, and are comfortable, but again, I usually wear a size 13, ordered a size 13, and yet they're too big.I wanted to exchange them for a size 12, but those are now out of stock, so away they go for a refund.:("
129465,0,"I did receive the Nuncio Pump, however, the one that I received is not the one that shows on the picture. I returned the shoe because it was too tight. I was advised that they ran large so I ordered 7.5m. So I brought up the fact that the shoes that I received was different and the person did everything he could to make it correct. The 2nd pair came and the shoe was still the wrong one. These shoes are very comfortable and I kept the color that was given to me which was also very pretty. It was more of a taupe snake texture."
300180,1,"I got these shoes for my husband, who has had a pair of these Sebagos for probably ten years or more. They are the same high quality and worksmanship, and he's looking forward to many years of wear with this new pair."
304916,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
261613,1,"buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ning&uacute;n problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva"
342473,0,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
155556,1,"Initially the item was not delivered to the requested address; since the seller is using the USPS, which is not as efficient as UPS or DHL; however the seller made all efforts to track the item and finally was located in some post office and I have to go my self and collect it.For deliveries, I would suggest to the seller, to use UPS or DHL even if you charge the client the additional cost."
156005,1,"A Rockport fan for the past 10 years. This one is a hit also. The order process through delivery met expectations. The shoe fits for size and as always quite comfortable for ten-hour work days. The only reason it was given a 4 of 5 was that I prefer a little better shine. As Rockport designed, they feel like you're wearing a pair of sneakers."
367084,1,"I have plantar fasciitis which is easily aggravated by most shoes - especially sandals. It has been especially difficult to find sandals that don't bother my feet. To complicate matters, I blister easily. And, I need adequate but not hard arch support or I have foot pain.These sandals are the most comfortable I have ever worn. I wear them all day - I hike and walk the dogs in them - I even have run in them when I've needed to - without any problems. I would give the six stars if I could for comfort without looking like clunky old-lady shoes."
87504,0,"I like these shoes for just slipping on to hang around or go run errands, but DO NOT buy these shoes for any kind of serious walking. The elastic around the ankle is not tight enough to keep your foot well located. Particularly on downhill stretches, my toes bunched up into the front of the shoes. I ended up with blisters as a result."
105309,1,My son loves sketchers and I bought these for a birthday gift. really well made and good looking shoe at a near give-a-way price. He loves the true to size fit and says they are more comfortable than any other dress shoe.
2853,1,My husband loves these shoes. We always buy more than one pair at a time so he always has a pair.
354060,1,"Very good quality boots can find better for this price,I am proud now when I own a pair of Timberland shoes."
246118,0,"I guess I will be keeping this pair, I need them for an event and it's too late to go looking elsewhere. It's seems comfortable--basic style and for women like me who can't tolerate heels, it's a nice dress option. But it's advertised on Amazon as leather and it's not leather, nor is it going to fool anyone."
91793,1,"February 7, 2008I wear boat shoes all day everyday along with polos, chinos or jeans. That is because I have worked for others all my life, am now retired and own a business. When I meet clients and friends, they accept my mode of dress as indicative of my success which in and of itself permits my non-conformance and Ralph Waldo Emerson-like self reliance. There are of course hordes of men and women all over the country who wear and love to include boat shoes in their lifestyle for a myriad of reasons and applications. The Timberland people put out a legitimate boat shoe all features considered. These are rugged, smartly styled, very comfortable boat shoes. The company has an immaculate reputation that consumers have relied on for a long time. Although other companies issue notable competition,while I do not know the comparable revenues involved, my recommendation as a Internet product reviewer is to buy Timberland if they are a featured vendor wherever you shop, with the complete realization that your total satisfaction is historically assured.Jay Adler, Music Critic"
17216,1,"This sandals is super amazing. At first when I worm it, it started to hurt my feet but last time I wore a sandals was 9 years ago... So I must get used to it.If you want a sandals that last long get this one. You won't regret."
10501,1,"I have had these shoes for 2 months, not a problem noted, seamless design, to spots for irritation, and I have not had any problems with sqeaking."
118858,0,"Casual looking, fairly lightweight steel toe shoe. Many of the places I've worked over the years required steel toe shoes though I could only find fairly heavy out of place looking boots. Once I discovered a number of companies offering steel toe sneakers I haven't looked back.This shoe has fairly good traction though If I had to pick again I would get a different brand as this shoe just doesnt hold snugly as my others have. It is sized correctly and I've given it three weeks to break in.Update:Three other employees where I work also had this same shoe and one other had the same issue I did. Within weeks of light use the soles started separating from both shoes. I couldn't even make it through a whole year with these. While light, these are easily the worst steel toes I've ever had. Most other brands I've had last easily 2-4 years and by then its something else wrong with the shoe, not the whole bottom part falling off. I don't think I'll be going with converse again"
110769,1,"I bought these shoes for walking on trips, and I think they will be a good choice. For anyone who doesn't mind a &#34;clunky looking&#34; shoe, they are great and with good support. Very comfortable, roomy, and sturdy at the same time. These are especially good for women with wide feet as they come in various widths. I would say yes, buy them. I wore them right out of the box and they felt broken in."
118504,1,"Great product with fast shipping. The shipping cost was a bit high, but since the actual product wasn't too much, it evened out. The product was shipped in the flat rate priority box, which I know doesn't cost more than $10, but I paid WAY over that for the actual shipping. They definitely made a large profit on the overpricing of shipping!The bags are being used as awards and the ladies that have received them (we embroidered them with their names and the award) say that they just love them!"
121094,0,Unfortunately it has a seam right across the back heel that makes it unwearable for me. Too bad as it is so cute.
261494,1,"The order was a birthday gift for a granddaughter. It arrived promptly at her house and upon opening the gift on her special day, she informed me that she LOVED them. Service was great."
158052,1,"Comfortable and pretty too. However, not recommend buying from amazon. I found one in the store is cheaper..."
362152,0,I bought these shoes for myself. They look nice but there is no arch support and they just don't fit all that well. They are sitting in my closet and will probably end up at the local Goodwill.
254351,1,"Wonderful sneakers! They are comfortable and stylish. They run slightly large ( I wear a size 7 shoe, so I ordered a 7). They are very roomie, but comfortable and I can wear thick socks with them if I need to."
373538,0,All aspects of getting and using four of these in three colors were great accept that the quality varied.Three pair are perfect and wear well but one fell apart. It was re-glued and has performed well since then.
103883,0,"I bought the size I would typically in the glass, and they are seriously tight. I would have probably gone up a half size if I had been able to try them on. I think it is fixable with a shoe stretcher, and this is just a warning."
327511,1,"The shoes were dlivered on time and are wonderful.If you like the way neg. heel shoes just roll along you will love these shoes.I walk 6 miles a day.As you walk your legs start to work with the shoes,it takes time,and the fluid motion gets easy.You just flow along.You'll see. I think 8-10 miles will be easy.I hope these shoes last many miles.Dan"
333531,1,"still the best jazz shoe for the serious dancer. soft and flexible, I just wist the toe was stronger,after 6 months we always have holes."
119482,1,"Have only worn them twice, but good things to say about them so far. First of all, they weren't as stiff as I thought a brand new pair of spikes would be, and they are a pretty good looking pair of shoes. Good buy."
306867,1,These boots are very cool! Not at all hard on the balls of your feet. Can walk in them all day. However they are a little heavy. But for beginners in the high heel or platform shoe department these are still very nice boots.
51548,1,"I have bought this shoe for work, play and just plain walking for 5 years. They are the best. I use special insoles inside and I have the best fit and feel ever. Highly recommend them to everyone."
337526,1,"My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day. He wanted ""work"" boots so he could be like his Daddy. Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long. He is very hard on footwear, but so far these seem to be holding up well. He even wears them to school on days he doesn't have gym."
207949,0,"These look as great being worn as they look in the picture; however, they do not hug the foot well. I wear nothing smaller than a 10 but have a narrow heel. These fit very loosely at the heel and slip off easily, so I'll either return them or try a shoe insert to improve the fit."
333925,1,"I haven't had a pair of Wallabees since I was in high school, but happening upon a Clark's ad brought them back to mind. I ordered a pair, and am glad I did. Next to my Clark's Desert Boots and my Birkies, these are the most comfortable shoes I own. I teach, and as such am on my feet all day. My Wallabees make the concrete floor a little less hard."
363719,1,"These all black Chuck's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online. They shipped in a timely fashion. Great Kicks, good deal."
193668,1,"I ordered some k Swiss for my daughter and I love them, they look so cute on her and the price was even better!!!!"
261634,1,"I had the experience of having to exchange these shoes. It was fairly simple and I had no issues. I ordered them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They arrived fairly quickly in the mail. Though we ordered her normal size, they were about 1/2 size too large. So I followed the online instructions and sent them back for an exchange. I received a replacement in just a little over a week. I was impressed with the quick turnaround. The only drawback is that I had to pay to ship them back and also include a check for $7.99 to cover shipping of the new shoes."
389408,1,"Boots fit perfectly when using boot liner/sock combination. Very soft leather, break in time was just a few days. If you want a pair of boots that are solidly made that you can wear anytime, this is the pair you need to get. I purchased these originally for use when I ride my motorcycle, but have since found I can wear them anytime. These are definitely the best, most comfortable boots I have ever owned. I have even ordered a pair of the Brown boots and look forward to getting them delivered some time next week. Highly recommended!!"
334351,1,I have these in black western and they are extrememly cute and comfortable. They break in nicely and I haven't had any quality issues.I'd buy them again in different colors.I feel they run maybe a tad small lengthwise.The color I have makes everything look dressier yet offers the flat sole that I love.Great shoe!!
289840,1,I bought this shoe because it was on sale at a great price. This shoe looks great and is really comfortable. I highly recommend this brand and style.
208596,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
254173,1,"OMG! i've worn my converse everyday for an entire school year an the worst that happened was a few small holes that gave it a distressed look. you can just throw them in the washing machine an they come out as white as they were when you bought them. i got new ones after 1 year because the bottoms began to wear out slightly ( emphasis on slightly ). overall, best sneakers you will find anywhere!p.s. they look better when the laces are loose not extremely tight."
141590,0,"Son buenos ahora pense que podian ser como los SAS, si esa son las espectativas no los compres , ahora como zapato comun no estan mal"
308233,1,"If you're into the retro stuff, this really is a great pair of sneakers. People forget how comfy they wear and despite what your friends may think, they do actually still look pretty good with almost any jeans/combats. Whether it's the hi-tops or this nifty pair, you just can't go wrong for $30."
11582,1,"I have had these boots for about 2 years, I have hiked through the woods, dug 4' deep ditches in hard clay, and I take several motorcycle trips every year. I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape. After all this I just polished them with kiwi parade gloss shoe polish to a mirror finish that would make your drill instructor proud (not an exaggeration they do take a good polish). Before I got these boots I went through about two pair of shoes a year, these boots are so tough that they will easily last for another 2 years. I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years, and for the price cannot be beat. I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off, they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use."
350446,0,Not bad for the price. I guess I need to break them in as they are hurting my feet at this point.
69656,1,"I am an intermediate runner I would say. I run various 5K and 10K's, Half marathons and have started to dabble into the world of trail and adventure racing. I say that to let you know I am no professional but I do love to run and compete against myself. For the Kansas City half marathon this past year I wanted to try a minimalist shoe to see if my times would change any from my times I produced in Nike Vomero's and Mizuno Wave's. I tried multiple pairs of this type of shoe on and unfortunately for me (due to the color scheme) these felt the best.I was amazed at how comfortable they felt because by looking at them you would think it would feel like an old High School CC waffle, not the case. The only running I did on these prior to raceday was about 5 miles at an easy pace on a treadmill to get the feel of the shoe. Raceday comes and yes I get alot of looks but I eventually get over that. The first couple of miles were interesting and I thought I had made a mistake. However, once I got into my stride these performed greatly. I was able to maintain splits at personal record times with no thoughts about foot and leg pain. By the end of the race I had knocked off 5 minutes from my previous times, I will let you decide whether it was the shoe or training. My legs felt great as did my feet. I did have one little ""hot spot"" on one of my toes but that should be expected.I tried these just to see what it would be like to race in a minimalist shoe and I can now say I will never race in a trainer again. I swear by these shoes for racing and speedwork. Get over the color scheme and enjoy this pair of shoes. Oh yeah the ""ecco friendly"" piece doesn't hurt either."
281081,1,So comfy and goes with any outfit. Great for everyday wear and you look cool too. I literally wear them everyday.
207257,0,"Love these shoes, bought 2 pair, and they are comfortable but they're just too high a heel for me. I teeter and can only take tiny steps. Still gorgeous shoes for those who know how to walk the walk."
372439,1,"Already have Chucks in white, which I wore for the b-ball team in high school...yeah, when Chucks were the shoes to be wearin'!! Decided to re-live days of Sandlot Black PF Flyers with the magic wedge, make you run faster, jump higher! But when I got them, they were about a 1/3 size too small and the shoes felt uneven (one bigger than the other, both still tight). Thought I could wear them in and couldn't. Chalked up to a loss. Paid less for black Chucks and they fit true to size! Love these black Chucks! GREAT PURCHASE!!Wonder what the difference is in the monochrome black. Anyone know?"
191428,1,"These shoes are inexpensive, light weight, and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first. There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I'm happy with them."
257895,0,I bought these for work they are very well made you will see. Just want to forwarn though any potential buyers..........this brand of shoe runs very small and narrow. Normally I ware a 6 narrow and I bought these in a 7 and they were so tight I could barly get my foot in. So order a coulple sizes larger then you normally wear____SERIOUSLY!!!
245198,1,Heavy duty and VERY comfortable. I'm really rough on shoes. I've had these only a short time but can tell already they are well made and will last. Great value!
120468,1,The butterfly is so cute! It's nice to have something distinguishing without having to get a crazy color. I use these shoes for powerlifting as well as everyday wear. I visited the seller's website and they have a pretty large variety of designs. Would like to see some in kids' sizes but I couldn't be happier with my new Chucks!
159537,1,It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
326296,1,I purchased recently ASICS Men's GT-2100 and i have to say i am very satisfied with this product. i really enjoy it every time i go to the gym. I can only recommend to people to use this product.
7058,1,They have been the perfect gift for my cold natured sweetie. He said they are very comfortable and warm! Two big requirements for him!
16642,1,"I play rugby in mine. I wore them in the shower the first day i got them, and i have never had blisters!"
63281,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
306089,1,"This is a great shoe. Real light and well constructed. Lots of support, great bargain for the money."
294050,1,"These mocs are comfy and sturdy enough to wear to work every day -- I work retail, so I'm on my feet for about 7-8 hours a day. I have to wear arch-support inserts with them, but I do that with every shoe I own. I would buy these mocs again."
251922,1,"Perfect fit, soft yet durable,properly ventilated, makes walking a pleasure..They are healing my feet..I will be ordering another pair soon..."
258953,1,"Since Nike bought Converse the have altered the shoe. There used to be an extra piece of stitched canvas on the inner part just below the big toe and stitching through the back heal of the canvas. The show is basically the same, except without this extra stitching and canvas they do not last as long."
248445,1,Looks just as I thought it would. The sizing is acurate no problems with shipping or anything! I love them. And now I know a great way to purchase shoes without the holiday hassle
152557,1,"This was my third time purchasing these Jungle moc's. I love them. They are practically the only shoe I've been wearing for the last 9 years.Very comfortable, lightweight, and they hold up well too."
48879,0,"This is a very lovely bag, and looks well-made and high-quality -- but I thought that the leather was too stiff and the strap-drop was also a bit too short, making it a struggle to get things in and out of the purse while having it on/over the shoulder."
99336,1,These shoes are sturdy! I wanted something with the feel of a tennis shoe but would be &#34;dressy&#34; enough to wear with dockers and casual business clothes. This fits the bill. They're both comfortable and sturdy and seem like they'll last me a while. Worth every penny!
165086,1,"Going shopping to buy shoes for my 96 year old Mom is difficult to impossible. I was able to go online since I had the brand and shoe size. I compared prices on several sites and Amazon offered the best. The shoes arrived quickly and they were exactly what I wanted. Mom is wearing her new shoes and the entire transaction was soo.. easy for me. Thanks, SFSoftspots Women's Annie Hi Oxford"
179273,1,"The black Chuck Taylor's are a must have classic for the shoe lover. I own two pairs of them myself, and would never buy anyother shoe. Why? They're so comfortable and match EVERYTHING!"
124319,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
379459,1,"These shoes worked great for us. My daughter has a very wide foot, and despite the man-made material, they fit her comfortably. You would have to spend a lot more to get this shoe in leather, so this was a deal."
334181,1,"just as comfortable as the pair I had in the 70&#34;s I just wish they where American made, love the Clark brand!"
254848,0,"I don't know if that is a normal thing, but I was surprised to say the least. I had the foresight to go half a size down from what I normally wear. It fits well."
339394,1,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
378599,1,I have narrow feet and it's difficult to find shoes in my size. These were size 13 B and fit fine and are good walking shoes.
271311,1,Got them for a little girl who is almost 7. She loves them and they are holding up very well. She got two pairs and both look well made and true to picture color. From what I can tell the sizes run spot on as well.
359596,1,These Crocs are very comfortable and sturdy. They have slip resistant soles and are good on all surfaces. They are easy slip on and off. These Crocs are also easy to clean in the sink and dry in minutes. Must have for all closets.
48999,1,"Great! Just what I expected. Description was perfect, size and color are representative of the picture provided. Great gift, price."
271383,1,"I've worn this shoe for almost a year and I couldn't be more happier with it. It's light weight and grabs the floor like no other shoe I've owned and for the price, it's a great buy. I'm so happy with it that I just bought my second pair due to the first being worn out. I play squash and volleyball about 5 hours a week total so the shoe has held up well. A few guys I know are also on their second pair of these and they are more than satisfied with Asics quality. I'm sure the Rocket III is just as good, but why mess with a good thing."
130967,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
327407,1,"These shoes are touted as the best walking shoes you can get. I haven't tried all of them, but these are really great. I am glad I bought them. I have bilateral knee arthritis and walking can be difficult. These shoes have helped an awful lot."
365881,1,"They were a last minute Christmas gift. They came so quickly, the size was normal, the color fun, he loved them."
124962,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
306606,0,"I bought these shoes a little less than a year ago. Within two weeks I noticed the threading was coming undone. Now the shoes are stringy with the thread coming undone. I'm upset because I payed 76 dollars for these shoes, the most I've ever paid. Before these I had a pair of reeboks that I had for three years before they were at the same level of disrepair, and I was doing a lot more running in the reeboks. All in all, the saucony's got me through the year but I'll need to buy new shoes for the upcoming school year."
37625,0,"Great looking shoes, husband loves these and finds them very comfortable .. Run true to size - gets a pair or two every year!12/27/21 Well they still are a good looking shoe BUT my husband wore them for the first time this morning and the top of both shoes started peeling and cracking -within first hour of wearing!! Be warned something is up with the ""leather"" ..I read some other reviews seems we are not the only one who has had this problem!"
234547,1,nice and comfortable. stylish. it goes well with suits or just with jeans for a classy look.
210120,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
268941,1,"These shoes allow me to be comfortable while looking good as a medical professional. I appreciate the extra width, the sizing is accurate. I liked them so much, I ordered a second pair the day after I received my first. I'm very satisfied with the Prowalker by Rockport."
64453,0,I recently had foot surgery and was looking for a nice wide plain sneaker. These are really cute but not wide enough. I would order the widest they offer. I will be giving these away and ordering the wider one. I really like them
97222,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
110724,1,shoes weren't tight in the morning but by end of the day I was ready to kick my shoes off and be barefooted. Made my feet swelled because they got tighter as the day went by due to it being kinda narrow & high - cut of foot circulation a bit. Still love the look though.
122882,1,"Haven't been able to find this specific pair of Skechers in any of my local stores, was quite pleased to find a new pair in my size. When they got here, they were exactly what I wanted and received in a timely manner."
271856,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
221695,1,I have a lot of foot problems and Earth Shoes really help my foot. This shoe fits fine and it is very comfortable. I will enjoy wearing them.
233854,1,"I am a fanatic of the boots, have a few of several brands and can say that these are of a good quality, excellently ended, am very comfortable, expect to continue acquiring products of this brand"
4064,1,These shoes work excellent in a lot water conditions. My husband has been using them for more than 4 years. We tried others brands but this ones are the best.
305613,1,This is by far the most comfortable shoe..It is a outstanding walking shoedoes not need to be broken in...ready to walk or just wear
4354,0,"I want to like these boots. They are pretty well made, and look like they will last a good while. They have one significant issue - they fit my foot, but are very stingy with material around the ankle bones. Almost not enough tongue to cover, but only where the ankle joint is widest. I have never had a boot fit this way.Secondly, the inserts are useless, and had to be thrown out immediately.I will wear them for a while and see how they fare, and I may revise his review."
149464,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
207897,1,"Buying shoes online can be tricky, but I couldn't resist buying these huaraches by Softspots, and I'm glad I took the chance. They are a well-made, comfortable and attractive shoe, and I've worn them non-stop since they arrived. The selection of colors is great, but when I was trying to choose a color, I saw some colors were already gone: a testament to how popular this shoe is. I chose brown, because it's a neutral color and will go well with anything I wear. I bought my regular shoe size, which fit very well. Overall, I am pleased with these shoes and will probably buy another pair in another color."
93928,1,I love these classic shoes. This is the second pair I have purchased. They look good with everything. They are very comfortable. I will definately purchae again.
187215,2,Well I received these boots today. Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I don't understand how they're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero wasn't an option.
227532,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
119333,1,"This is just what my husband was looking for and could not find. He is very picky about his things. They are extremely comfortable, top is soft on foot, light weight, ""just right"". He is a happy camper, thank God! Anyone should love these slides, good deal."
101036,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
296852,1,The color is actually darker when it's brand new. It was tight in the beginning but super comfortable after wearing for 2 days. I will purchase another pair of Clark's shoes very soon.
316482,1,"The title sums it up but I'll break it down a little. These shoes are comfy, classic, timeless and stylish. The main attribute of these shoes is the level of comfort and support they provide. They offer great shock absorption and to top it off they are versatile and whenever you wear them you'll have comfort at your 'toe tips' (fingertips, get it?). I've always been a fan of the wallabees and I will always be. Get yourself a pair of these and you'll become a fan too."
187396,1,"Love these boots, but most of all love the color. Thought we were looking for the color ""bronze"" since some photos show the metallic gold being very yellow. These are definitely not a yellow, gold metallic, but a brownish, or bronze metallic. Very versatile!!"
19668,1,"Beautiful shoes and cost over 3 times the price in Australia where I have purchased before so still a good buy even with air freight from Amazon. However most shoes in Australia come only in one width and not too many in half sizes and so shoes purchased in the US with their large range of sizes and widths can be confusing. Most shoes here also have US , UK and metric sizes on the label and my size 9 Aus shoes are nearly always shown as 10 US (however some websites say 9 AUS is equivalent to 9.5 US). These Rockport shoes are only sold as ""W"" in Australia which most retailers say is equivalent to 3E (most manufacturers here have only standard width or in rare cases 3E) whereas in the US 3E = XW and there are many many other widths.Unfortunately what I thought was the Australia equivalent of my size 9 wide, i.e size 10 US / 3E turned out to be too big and too wide. Am now trying US size 9.5 and width 2E but considering I can buy 3 pairs of these Rockports from Amazon delivered by airfreight for the same price as one pair in Australia where no one discounts them, it is still cheaper for me to try. So make sure you order the correct size AND width!Perhaps Rockport (as with many other suppliers and items) can explain why the RRP in the US is $99 US per pair (price on average on Amazon $67 US) whereas here in Australia the RRP is $220 AU (about $216 US at current exchange rate, or $275 US at the exchange rate of a few months ago) and there is no discounting and yet they are all made in Vietnam or China wherever you buy them."
237649,1,These make wonderful Taekwondo mat shoes. They decrease mat friction and still allow you to see your foot positions. They pack easily. My new one's are my 3rd pair.
277282,1,"Crocs are to size but will eventually feel more comfortable as you wear them. Surprisingly, they do not retain foot odor nor do they 'sweat'. Perfect to walk to the beach and then into the water and home. Sandy feet? Carry your Crocs into the water, rinse feet and crocs and put them on and away you go. Cool as my granddaughters would say!"
163661,1,"Liked the sneakers, they were for my daugher who uses them to cheerlead in and she said that they were very comfortable. The price was right and I'm glad i was able to find them and purchase them."
265446,1,"Took these boots with me to Big Bend National Park and did 15 miles of hiking up and down the mountains there. I wear a size 16 so finding something that fit was very cool. The boots are very high quality and I didn't even break them in before I went hiking with some family, and they gave me no problems at all. Cant beat the $60 I paid for them."
58827,1,I can asure that when you get this new sandals you will feel great this is a special sandal and you will enjoy it alot. i love them to walt or to stay at home they are great
344175,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
68779,1,"Several years ago I had problems running to include back pain and shin splints and was limited to running 2 or 3 miles at a time. I absolutely hated running, and I attribute this to ill-fitting shoes. After lots of searching for a new pair of shoes, I was recommended a pair of New Balance shoes...can't remember the exact model, but it was a predecessor to the 856. Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring. Good to see they're still available."
209229,1,"I ordered these boots for my dad, who is impossible to please. He is very fussy about his boots, and they needed to be:black, not too shiny, not have an advertising logo visible, be unlined (just leather, so he can wear them in summer), have classic styling and stitching, rounded toe, not too grippy on bottom, but not absolutely slick, have no leather ""by-products"", go up high enough on his leg, and fit under his jeans. We actually found something close to custom order - for about $250-300, non-returnable (Did I mention they couldn't be more than $150?). Not only would that seem impossible to find, but he needed them to be available in extra-wide sizes because I guess his feet are a bizarre shape. AND he wanted them by next week, since his ""work sneakers"" were falling apart at the seams. He wanted these to be his work boots.I received the boots within a few days, and gave them to my dad, who slipped his feet in and lit up. I checked in a few days later and he said they're so perfect he almost doesn't want to wear them to work - they're just too nice. I did see he wore them to church a few days ago. The impossible to satisfy was finally satisfied by these boots - so I HIGHLY recommend these to any man looking for a comfortable, durable, attractive classic leather boot.The price is a great deal, and you're not cutting corners. This is a quality product."
388286,1,"TROOP Footwear is back for the 2k3 and they are hot. These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
64377,1,I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide. I'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair.
220251,1,The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected. I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider.
26550,1,"This shoe is very nice, BUT, order your regular size; it does not run large!! Bought these for my Mom and ordered a half size up based on the product description and will have to exchange them."
385934,1,"I was looking for pair of comfortable brown shoes I could wear to work with slacks. These are great, true to size, and a nice dark shade of brown - not too light. Great shoes for the price."
67878,1,beautiful and very comfortable!nice to get these shoes for Christmas.I bought them for a holiday in Jerusalem.I am very pleased)
226209,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
319683,1,This is a very comfortable shoe. Not stiff and lighter weight than it would appear. I purchased a wide width and it fit very nicely.
346981,1,MuCh more comfortable than they look. Everything old becomes new again. Platforms are in once more.
254197,1,Ordered these for my granddaughter who is thrilled. They arrived in a short amount of time. Great service.
169157,1,Very comfortable boots. Fit to size. These are my fourth pair and the only Western boots that I can really wear in comfort.
340700,1,"I love my new shoes! they fit great and look great. My daughter keeps taking them so I may have to get her a pair. nah, let her get her own!!"
209254,1,I bought this shoe several years ago in a store in a medium width and they never fit right. These are just wide enough to be comfortable and dressy enough to go almost anywhere. They work with narrow ankle pants and jeans to give a finished look.
218015,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
84143,1,"I love this shoe because it is dressy, classy and comfortable...and a flat. I search extensively for the shoe with the proper look to wear with my suits. This shoe is it!! In addition to coming in various colors -- it comes with a patent tip/heel. And did I say comfortable? There is no traditional break-in period. The shoe just molds itself to your foot (soft leather). A must have."
182464,1,"I work in a restaurant every day need walking shoes for me, is very important, this pair of shoes, very lightweight, very comfortable."
218163,1,"The tennis shoes arrived quickly. They fit, as always and arte a great value"
333767,1,"The Bostonian Prescott loafer is a must for all men who have a wide foot at the toe, but who slip out of size DD or E. The soft leather forms to your foot and provides long-lasting comfort. The only downside is the lack of color variation as I have two pair of black and the burgudy, but would like a light tan or similar."
215105,0,"Cute and what a bargain. If I'd of paid full price, I would have complained about the odd odor. Make sure you pack them in a plastic bag when traveling because your clothes will take on the rubbery odor. The shoe also fit a bit larger than actual size."
78606,1,"I had to buy several Converse All-Star shoes for my newly formed basketball league. The wife recommended buying them at the German retail giant Kohl's. She wanted to use the 30% off coupon. But for some reason them Germans don't want to carry the in-between shoe sizes for those rare instances of humans that fit somewhere in the middle of 10 and 11.Thanks to the a seller on the Amazon Marketplace, I was able to get a pair at a comparable price that was shipped merely a day later after ordering! Yay to my new league getting to finally play their first game!"
66098,1,"I wore these shoes so much over two years that I wore them out....so I had to buy a new pair. These shoes are light weight, pack and travel great. They are very comfy, but please note that they do not have much arch support. I had to order a 1/2 size up and they are perfect."
150416,1,Excellent quality. I just wish the whole shoe was patent instead of top and heel.
257923,1,"It took Shoe Mall about a month to ship my order. When I finally received the shoes they look great. I got the light brown, and the leather is two tone. The top is a bit light than the sides. The sole is a pretty heavy duty rubber. These shoes weren't as comfortable as I was suspecting, but with a little breaking in I think they will be a nice shoe. For now they at least look great! And they do have a lifetime warranty. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase."
352790,0,"The tops of these shoes are very long and look ""manly"" I ordered an 8 even though I am a 71/2 (since they don't have a 71/2) and they were too large. So if you are going to order them, remember the top of the shoe is very long and order them small. I wonder if they are actually mens not womens?"
172548,1,"Call me old fashioned but I like the classic look...these ""New Age"" shoes that the younger generation are into are a bit too hideous for me.I bought a pair of the size 12(D)M (US) for walking. They're comfortable for the most part but seem a bit narrow, considering I bought them a 1/2 size larger than to which I'm accustomed. I'm still breaking them so I'm hoping that'll sort itself out eventually."
296435,1,this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had.Thanks
158928,0,"Timeless look, whether you're a prep or a punk, anyone can pull off wearing a pair of chucks. Not good for athletic performance, it shocks me to realize they were created for basketball use. Ouch! Also, due to their lack of traction and feeble soles, it's easy to burn through a pair in a matter of months if they're your regular shoe. That makes them not worth the $40 price tag Converse is offering them for. If they were $20-25, maybe. I recommend this shoe for people more concerned with style than comfort."
166579,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
197720,1,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
122951,1,"Pink laces were darker than the photo indicated--maybe 3 shades or so (could be my computer, could be something with the picture or the laces, hard to tell)."
194206,1,"Love these sandals! I've had three pairs of this style, and don't want to be without them in the summer. They""re very comfortable, and look good with dresses or shorts."
45016,1,The shoe had a wonderful fit. Looked exactly as it did in pic and was true to size.
212400,1,"I love these shoes, well made, comfortable and nice looking. I expect them to last me a good long time."
171740,0,"Firstly, I will list what makes this shoe great! I have had shoes before like this that were called ""leather"" yet the fabric torn within the first use. However, this is made from fine, real leather material I found to be very durable and of a high quality. The footbeds are some of the best I have ever used, and the bottom soles seem to be very stred resistant, unlike many dress shoes. I did find these shoes a little hot without super thin socks. Fit wise, there are some negatives. *I had to get this in a 4E, two widths normal than usual, which I usually never need to do. So be careful when chosing your width* Also the lining of the shoes is a little snug, maybe I am being picky, but that was just a little uncomfortable. The look is as simple as can be, so it will go with everything! As long as you are size cautious, you'll end up with a quality shoe."
362796,1,I love my new shoes! They fit great and I got them in no time. Thanks. * * * *
342238,1,"I used to feel pain on knees at the end of jogging and also the next day if I jog more than 3 miles at once. Not after I got this pair of shoes. It is light while provides excellent support. Reduces the impact on my knees as well. However, it is not the best choice for gym classes like kick-boxing or step. You have chance of spraining your ankles because of the structure of the sole. But for jogging, it is one of the best."
33049,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
387393,1,hola todo fino Excelenteeeeee muy hola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommendy poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendobuenoooooooooooooooooooo recomendado
108706,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
197376,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
137637,1,Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months. the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores. We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
287457,1,I am pretty particular about my shoes. These shoes are both comfortable and durable. Support was adequate but I replaced the Rockport inserts with Dr. Scholl's after about a year. I've been wearing these on and off now for over 3 years! Soles still look pretty good with just a little wear on the outside of the heels. They still look fine with a little polish and are still supportive and comfortable. I liked them so much I bought another two pair.
308860,1,I ordered these moccasins sometime during early december and they were shipped immediately and arrived when they were supposed to. I can't describe how much I like them. They are extremely comfortable and I wear them all around the house. They are warm and are very relaxing. Muy bien.
205382,0,"Descriptions on many products, even those with specs, (not all, and not just shoes) are lacking important detaials. These are not comfortable to walk around wearing as a substitute for say deck shoes. The main problem being they do not have an arch support. Without an arch support, it gets tedious to continually wear them. Such information should be supplied in the description/specs of shoes. The leather uppers are great, the sole should last a long time, but they are not comfortable for extended wear. Oh yeah, my cats think the shoes are great for sharpening their claws."
197456,1,"I bought this Converse sneaker in black. These All Star sneakers look stylish and good with any casual pants I own. I would have given the product 5 stars, EXCEPT, these shoes are like walking on bricks since they have no cushion in the soles for the heels. I understand they're supposed to have the whole classic appeal... but if you're over 30 years old and try to rock a pair of Converse for an entire day, you may encounter some uncomfortable lower back pain. So 4 stars for fashion."
320024,0,"A ballet shoe is a ballet shoe is a ballet shoe. Plain and simple. But they need to be worn a while to conform to your feet. If you have never tried them before, don't try to figure out which is the left and which is the right, they look just alike. I have a wide foot. Reviewers said these ran large, so I ordered my regular size... figuring they would stretch to make the right width, and at the same time get a little shorter. But, they hurt right away since they were too long and narrow. I didn't want to suffer while breaking them in. Fortunately my husband remembered we had a shoe stretcher, so I put that on them, one at a time for a few hours. Now they are a comfortable width and length, and I'm sure they will soon conform completely to my foot."
211203,1,I have used Easy Spirit when I show my dogs for several years. They are light weight and have good traction when moving my dog. I wore my last pair for several years until my new puppy chewed them.
290766,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The leather is soft and pliable. Buy these shoes!
9705,0,Not a very sturdy shoe compared to other Saucony I have bought. OK for day to day wear but would not run in it.
295357,1,"Got these for my wife so we could still take evening walks when the rural roads here get icy. The product is easy on, easy off, and she reports greatly improved traction and footing. Got a pair for msyelf too and I say the same: much easier to walk on packed road snow, faster walking, greater stability and traction, less fatigue."
48723,1,These boots were great! I ordered for my Halloween costume and they came before I expected them which was great!
54944,1,"The price was right, appreciated free shipping... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery... purchased for a gift, and it arrived the day I needed it... was worried it would not arrive"
377063,1,"My first pair of Wolverine boots. I have read nothing but good reviews, so I tried a pair. These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had. I use these 10 -12 hrs a day on concrete, gravel, slanted surfaces, etc. and these are sturdy and look nice. Almost like walking on air! Uppers made in Dominican Republic, assembled in the USA. I will never buy cheap Chinese (communist) made boots again."
197502,1,"I'm wearing these bad boys right now. These sneakers have a sexy look to them, and you can't go wrong with classic chucks at this price. Buy them! Every one should have black and white sneakers in their collection. They feel great, and I haven't had any problems with them yet. This is well worth the purchase. :-)"
286470,2,"I ordered these shoes based on the picture provided, when they arrived i was dissappointed the color was much darker than it looks and it looked much different."
219007,1,"I bought these after having own Asics 2080s, which I loved. I wanted another pair of shoes with the IGS system. The product description says that these shoes do, but upon receiving them I do not believe that they do. No where on the shoe does it say IGS, unlike my 2080s which clearly have the IGS symbol on the heel.Other than that, they are fairly comfortable shoes. I have not had the opportunity to run in them yet, as I am still breaking them in."
280565,1,"I got these boots right before it snowed a good 2 feet and they have been indispensable. The faux distressed look makes these boots trendy and at the same time they are very useful. The perfect blend of fashion and utility. I just bought another pair of Rocket Dogs because at this price, you can't beat it."
309549,1,"Very well made and quite cute.I love the slipper, but it runs short andthe toe section seems wider than normal.Overall I love my ""little dazzlers"".I also gave 2 pair as a gift and she saidthey were wide in the toe area, but wasequally pleased with them.EXCELLENT VALUE."
331818,1,I bought these for the advertised arch support and they do that for me. The strap however is a pain and I removed them... These are a bit over priced or I would get a 2nd pair..
115327,1,I asked for these for Christmas and I was so excited to get them! Great product! Comfortable! Cute and great price! I want to get a pair in every color!
303692,1,"Comfortable and pretty too. However, not recommend buying from amazon. I found one in the store is cheaper..."
53339,1,"This is a great shoe for lindy hop! It seems all the girls in East Coast swing use Keds shoes. I was having a problem because I have wide feet. I could not find wide width Keds in the local stores around my town. I was worried about the fit, so I tried my size on at the store of the med width, just to get an idea of the length to make sure I order the right size. I have worn them to several dances and they work and feel great. There is no need to get suede put on the bottom of these, they spin just fine on the dance floor. I am very happy with these shoes!"
320344,1,"purchased this item as a gift for my sister to wear for her dance performances in high school for her jazz dance elective. the 6.5w was wide for her feet so i made an exchange. it was an easy process. i made the exchange the day my sister received the shoes, the 6.5n pair was sent the next day and arrived the following day. they fit a lot better now even though it was a little more snug and the sides still made it look wide. she broke them in and loves doing her spins in them. thanks!"
199833,1,I ordered for my son for Christmas . ...he loves them ..I didn't know the left sole was different from the right but one is for gripping and one for sliding
188922,1,The items arrived on time and were exactly as advertised. We could not have been happier. My sone wears them most every day.
217965,1,I bought these as a gift for my son. The sizing was spot on. He loves them. They are apparently very popular nowadays!
138263,0,"My brother and I wear the same size of shoes, so he bought these and I wore them 2 days, they are too tight at the toe area, so my toes were a little sore the second time I used them. I purchased the Mizuno Men's 9-Spike Pro Limited Low G4 Cleat, and these are much more comfortable a more wide toe area."
10656,2,I purchased these shoes because I've always trusted capezio but the shoes just do not hold up well at all. I use them twice a week and have for the last 5 weeks and they already look awful like i've had them for years. The gathering on the bottom is beginning to come undone already too. I would suggest looking for a better model of shoe.
217630,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
249955,1,"Been using my pair for 2 years now. They are durable and quite comfortable. What I love about New Balance is that they are available in many widths, mine is 4E. It is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls. This one fits perfectly. I think the price is not too steep compared to other brands.It is my everyday shoes for work and recreation. It is described as walking shoes but I also use it for some light jogging & tennis. Nice minimalistic simple design. Leather is supple...and yes, the biggest reason I bought it is velcro."
77689,1,"This is a very elegant and comfortable boot that it will dress up any outfit.I am very happy with my purchase,and I would definitely recommend this product."
253450,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
298584,1,"I've had them for about a month now, and they are FANNNTASIC!!!!!!!You HAVE To Bring Them BACK to Buy!!!!They go with Everything! and they are SOOOOOO Comfortable!!!!!!!!!I Have the GOLD Color!!! and I want to buy another two more pairs!!! of those!!!BRING THEM BACK!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"
71601,2,"The boots were delivered within reasonable time. The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear. Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price. There is however a defect I noted on the second day. There are small cracks, about 12, 1/4"" long each at the back of the right shoe. Photo sent. Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund. Unfortunately, I am based outside of US and cannot ship back using prepaid UPS provided. Could have been nice shoes."
377778,0,"They are very nice looking shoes but they are a little tight in my toes, so I can use them not for long hours."
181164,1,My last pair of bowling shoes were from around 1995 and had the leather soles.It only took 2-3 practice frames to get used to these shoes. They fit great and slide great and you can't beat the price.
374573,0,"These gave me a little knee pain initially, but after a week or two they became the most comfortable shoes I own. I have hiked in soft dirt and walked on wet pavement without any slipping but these are not waterproof."
175583,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
115711,1,These shoes are great for work. They are comfortable (not too wide either so I'm not swimming in them) and look really nice to boot. Overall happy with my purchase.
75757,0,"I've been using these for a number of years and they work great. My ONLY complaint with them is where the end is doubled-over and sticked back on itself is very week. Almost all of these fail within a couple of months, but is easily corrected by restitching or safety-pinning. I'm fat and my work-shirts won't stay tucked in without them. I will keep buying these despite the very minor design flaw."
341203,1,"I've been wearing the ""Reebok Women's Princess"" model for more than 10 years.I usually buy 2 pairs per year(one black and one white). I beg Reebok to never stop making them. My 12 hour work shift (standing and walking)requires a comfortable pair of shoes and these are the best! And I am an expert in the subject, because I have ""problem feet"". Everything hurts my feet, except the Reebok princess. I can't live without them!"
365067,1,"The Last time I wore a pair of these, my codename was Roadrunner, fastest boy in the universe...lol.I bought these more for the nostalgiathan anything else.I have no complaints"
69280,1,"I bought these shoes in the Stone/Navy color. They're a great neutral color that goes with almost everything. They look nice with the khaki scrubs and chinos that I wear to work. They are true to size, but I'd definitely recommend ordering them in wide if your feet are wide in the least. The fit is a little snug across the top of my foot, but it has improved greatly over the first day of wearing. They were a little difficult to get on the first time, but it was much easier the second time. I only gave the shoes four stars because they are way overpriced at $54. I got them on sale through Amazon for $34.90. The quality is okay, but not outstanding. My daughter has these and the colored rubber accents on the bottom tread came off after a while. The part of the upper on the heel and above the suede accents is actually vinyl. I expected it to be cloth. Leather would have been much nicer. I hope to buy another pair in black or brown, but only if they are on sale!"
371308,1,"I own 2 pairs of these Quark Rockets. They are the best shoes ever. I work 12 hour shifts & I'm on my feet at least 10 hours. I tried the those expensive shoes with the ""spring"" in the heal. (cost over $200) The rubbed on my ankle bone & just were not comfortable. These are the lightest shoes ever. I feel like I'm almost barefoot! Yet, they are cushy enough that my feet & legs are NOT sore after 12 hours! I just love them. I wore them hiking in the Redwood National Park last summer, too!"
4960,1,"I run marathons and various triathlon distances, and have done plenty of miles happily on Asics Kayanos. I was worried about the cushioning on such a lightweight shoe when I took them out of the box. But they run beautifully. They are so incredibly light it makes a noticeable difference to my running. Not sure how long they would last given their minimalist design, but I guess we tend to retire our shoes before there are any signs of wear & tear on the upper part of the shoe anyway. The only issue for me is the tongue design - yes the single-fold makes sense in a weight-saving capacity, and once the shoes are on there are no comfort issues (on the contrary they feel great), but if you do triathlons and need to do a fast transition, you need to spend a bit longer to make sure they are put on right. Nevertheless, they are still my new favorite running shoe. JK"
133253,1,"These shoes worked out great for my three year old daughter just starting dance class. They are comfortable on her, and look so cute."
111754,1,"They looked good, so I bought them. They fit good, so I did not need to return them. They felt good, so I kept them. The service was great. I'd buy from them again."
349304,1,"This item was ordered as a gift for a relative, my nephew in Kansas. He received the item promptly and is very happy with it. Yes, we would order this item again."
99673,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
9026,1,THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS. WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE.
247639,1,"At first seeing the price of some of these Ecco shoes, I know a few may balk, saying, &quot;two-hundred bucks for a pair of shoes!&quot;I can assure you, Ecco shoes are worth every penny. The ones I am currently wearing have lasted over three years and still going strong.The best shoes I've ever owned."
300083,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
150468,1,I was very satisfied with the sneakers that I ordered for my son. He loved them. They were shipped in a timely manner and it was much easier than going to the stores during the holidays.
53509,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
78907,1,"I always liked Converse shoes and since i moved to the Dominican Republic, i've gone thru my share of overpriced fakes. I'm happy that i can get these online now. I like having shoes that go along with any type of clothing or colour.....any!!!!So yes, these are great and one cannot go wrong in purchasing a pair unless u get the wrong size. I will definitely buy another or others in different colours. No regrets on this purchase."
124531,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
63635,1,"wear them fall, winter, and spring. love these boots. I do use an innersole though.Great price from Amazon (the best I could find)"
335907,1,"This is the shoe that every teenager should be wearing when they leave the house. Abstinence is the only way to avoid pregnancy, STDs, and other associated health problems. Don't leave it up to them."
186412,1,I was looking for birkenstock because they are very supportive and comfortable whe you are on your feet as much as I am as a nurse.
148311,1,"I bought these for my wife. They look good on her. These hold up much better than thesuede ones without a sole. When that type gets wet, they take on a worn out look.My wife says they are light and comfortable. Minnetonka is a good brand name, and shehas already told me that when this pair, wears out, she wants the exact pair in white.What more can be said. She's very happy with them."
157765,1,"There are a lot of hard core Chuck Taylor addicts out there and after ordering my first pair I can say I'm still outside that bubble. They look good and the high top doesn't squeeze my ankle or anything like that. The sizing was dead on so don't order a half size larger thinking it's a good idea! My 9's were dead on. The Chucks are a seasonal shoe I wouldn't wear them in the extreme cold, or really rainy days. As for soles and support they're flat. I've owned Vans and they're even flatter than that with less support. It might just be I'm not a kid anymore, or I've got the wrong type of foot but I'm not so sure. I'm expecting these to be my pair of Chucks to last a while because I'm not gonna be wearing these every day. So, they're definitely good .. and everything that other people love, but I think I'd rather wear Vans."
347250,2,"Watch out, Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size. We ended up giving them away, my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly."
381974,1,This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought. All different colors. They are great to wear in the office in the summer.
44540,1,"Wonderful, cute boots for such a great deal !!!! For $9.99 you cant beat them."
157434,1,"I ordered these for my 18 year old son. He LOVES them. Has a purple shirt that he wears with them - bought them about 10 months ago and he has worn them so much that they are almost worn out - that's how much he likes them. I would buy him more, but he is going into the military soon. Love Lo Purple Chuck Norris Converse! Thanks Amazon."
78399,1,"I bought these shoes for my daughter a few months ago because we could not find them at the store. It was well worth the risk of buying them the wrong size because they are exactly what she was looking for. They don't look cheap, they're not noticeably dirty even when they are, and for a girl mostly importantly, is that they match just about any outfit. We can't find anything negative to say about these shoes."
243671,1,"Converse All-Stars are the all-American shoe, and the black monochrome goes with everything. Seriously; I've worn these to the opera."
75430,1,"I love these bogs. however they are heavier than I thought they were going to be. a little overkill for my uses, but fun and very functional."
113241,1,"I bought these boots after searching for the most versatile pair I could find. I wasn't sure about choosing brown over black, but I'm happy with the brown. It's a rich shade of brown with some red tone in it, very pretty, and can be worn with black pants if you want. Looks very cute with skirts, jeans, whatever. Also pretty comfortable overall. The heel is low so they're pretty easy to walk in. I read reviews about the boots that suggested ordering a 1/2 size up, which I did. I recommend ordering a full size up. These boots run very small. I wear a size 9 and have a narrow foot. The width was fine, but the length is a little tight. I haven't seen anyone else with boots like these, which is always nice. Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase."
82322,1,"I go through a pair of these about once a year. They are so soft and warm and hold up great. After about a year of being worn daily, the padding on the bottom starts to break down, but that is to be expected after that long. I highly recommend these."
296812,1,"I sized down 0.5 sizes from 8.5 to 8.0 like many have suggested and found these Chukka's to fit really well. However, the leather is quite stiff in the first few wears and more persistent break-in may be required to get comfortable. The beeswax color begins kind of a uniform dark brown, but it has since really brightened with wear and some nice lighter colors are coming through.Overall a great boot, just be aware that they may be a bit stiff to start off."
275239,1,"I have worn Hi-Tec boots for many years now. This is my third pair of Altitude boots. They are comfortable, durable and relatively inexpensive. The boots are great for day hikes these are a good boots for light to moderate loads. If you are looking for a stiff boot for heavy backpacking I would recommend looking at another model of boot. Hi-Tec makes other model boots specifically for backpacking with heavier loads."
101818,1,"After reading many of the reviews I ordered a half size bigger. My daughter is a 11.5 in street shoes and the 12M I ordered are too big and too wide. I am glad I did not order a full size larger, as many reviews suggested."
47336,1,This shoe is durable and comfortable. It works for many different running surfaces for the outdoor runner. I recommend it.
129031,1,"HELP!, I need somebody, HELP! Not just anybody....and soforth. I cant buy these shoes ANYWHERE!!! Ive searched all over and they either dont have them in my size or I just cant buy them. this site wont let me buy them cuz it isnt listened as a product i can buy... i have no idea why. If any1 has any information on where i can get my hands on these shoes please email me at: stevemosca@hotmail.com"
203532,1,"Great style. feel good and fit well. Quality leather, good stiching, quality heal and sole with smooth finish. Will buy again in future."
27982,1,"They velcro...I bought them a bit big but they can be tightened with the velcro. Of course, they don't get dirty and so far, they appear to be very durable. They do not light up...fyi."
166318,2,these are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned. the tongue is so wide it wraps around your ankle and digs into your ankle bone. no way to fold it to keep it away. but they should never wear out. after an hour a day for six months trying to break them in they are still stiff and hard to wear. I would not recomend these to anyone.
275381,1,"This is my third pair. The first finally wore out after 5 years of use in the yard and all around durring the winter and my second is reserved for just hiking, (they took me over the Indian Himilayas very nicely, thank you.)Light weight, inexpensive, and a good fit. I can recomend them. Oh Yea they truly are water proof till about 5 years old."
246813,0,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
17893,1,"Wore these in the Air Force for about nine years. Tried a different boot this last go around and quickly realized my mistake. I love Corcoran boots and am glad I am wearing them again. I would highly recommend them as they are comfortable, secure and last a good amount of time with regular polishing."
2220,1,This is my fourth set of Hi Tec boots. They are the only shoe I own that never hurt my feet. They are made well and last.
386165,2,"im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts, now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gonna throw it on the trash , i wasted $38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this ,i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed"
254567,1,"Very solid, timeless, and stylish choice. Make sure you order a size to a size and a half down from your usual size. I wear an 11 in Nike and ordered a 10 for these - 9.5 would be optimal for me."
15783,1,"I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens, but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price. They are lightweight and comfortable, and look very nice in solid black. The best thing about them is their durability. I am tough as hell on shoes in general, but these are very scuff resistant. I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair, but we'll see."
241308,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
207409,1,These shoes are well worth the price. The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. They also look great. A+
34026,1,"I love these shoes! I have bought several pairs in different colors. They are as comfortable as atheltic shoes but much more stylish. But beware--they run small! I normally wear a size 6.5, but I have to order a size 7 with these."
353218,1,"I have only worn them a few times, but they are comfortable and look great with skirts or slacks. I had a different pair of dress backless shoes that had a heel that was too flexible, but this one is wonderful."
275386,1,"Worked out of the box, used them for a few days on the treadmill, but probably wasnt needed. I have been using them for the weekly Treks here at Mission Peaks in the Bay Area, CA, which has pretty good uphills. No complains so far.Rated 4 only for the fact that the heels could use a little more padding - the heel of the shoe is hard which is good for support but not too good when you are walking up-slope. Also have been wearing 2 socks for better grip and to provide more cushion for the heels."
164790,0,Couldn't get my foot more than half way in. Liked the style very much but was not confident I would get the right size by reordering. Cost me ove 8 dollars to return the shoes.Easy Spirit Women's Motion Sport Lace Up/ camel
306544,1,"I'm in the Coast Guard, and i just got the boots and so far they seem to be really good. They shine up pretty easily and they're very cushioned. On other reviews, people said that they bought half a size smaller and i'm happy I did. They fit like a gem. I look forward to wearing them in an operational environment."
203029,2,"Shame on me twice for getting a shoe that has a hard mid-foot. The first was recommended by a Footaction's salesman for an Asics Gel shoe. He said I was flat-footed and need a pair of shoe with arch support or a mid-foot stiffener. After my first jog my arches were hurting me. I thought it was a new pair and needed to be worn in. Tried it a couple more times and it didn't get any better. So back to Nike's Air Max.After great successes and comfort of Adidas MegaBounce and AS Trail, I shifted alliance with Nike to Adidas and decided to get the more cushioned Supernova 6 over the cheaper Orbed. For me with a flat foot and the left feet having the tendency to roll inward, this became extremely painful. More pain on the left, but not too much on the right foot. So I guessed it more of my physical makeup then just the shoe.The ShoeThe shoe itself is fairly awesome and extremely padded on the sides and cushioned in the front and rear foot. Again I don't like the mid-foot Torque system. I have likened the wider foot design of Adidas and Asics over the narrower Nike design; typically I had to buy a one size longer for Nike shoe. The upper mesh is one of the best ventilated materials out there. Plus the looks of Adidas shoe design are more pleasing in my eyes then the extravagant Nike's deigns. I can still use this shoe for walking, because it is quite comfortable like what I did with the other Asics Gel.Just not for my feet."
273905,1,"These boots seem to be very well made, and I have yet to slip on ice due to the super grippy soles. Of course, they look awesome.However, I bought the smallest size that Demonia makes (6), and they are too big all around. I'm generally a size 6, sometimes 5 1/2, but these feel closer to a 7 or 8 (I can't make my toes touch the end even if I try). Also, the boots stay up because they are stiff, but they are also loose on my calves and ankles. These are not designed for small and slender people."
241336,1,The shoes ordered on this web site are satisfactory. Thanks for sending the order promptly and in perfect condition.
46673,0,"Not the same quality wallet that Buxton produced in the past. Interior of wallet and check book cover is vinyl, thin vinyl at that. The exterior is leather and is very pretty. I don't think this wallet will hold up to daily use very long. Would not order again."
28402,1,"This is the 2nd pair of the same style I have bought. The first pair I bought about 6 year ago and have worked them hard in an offshore commercial diving environment. That first pair is just now starting to fail, so I've now bought another. Great pair of steel to work shoes!"
351710,1,"I gave these to my Mom for Christmas, and she loves them. When she's not wearing shoes, she's wearing these slippers. She loves the fact that she can wear them outside and not worry about having to change into shoes, as traditional slippers can be ruined this way. They keep her feet warm, but not too warm, which is the big selling point for her with slippers."
71242,0,"I bought my first pair of these boots at Airborne School, needing more appropriate boots for running in, as one does during the course. I found them to be extremely light (comparable in weight to Oakleys) and comfortable out of the box. You know how you used to have to break in your Bellvues or Altamas before even thinking about rucking with them? Not really a worry with these guys, as long as the fit is proper, you can complete a decent-length ruck march with little to no break-in. Also, they are somewhat water-resistant. Aside from those aspects, one more plus is that if you get the model with the rubberized toes and heels, its one less thing things to worry about scuffing up in garrison..HOWEVER. Don't expect these boots to last more than a year under rough condition. They are made and China, after all, which in itself is a discredit to the item. If water DOES get inside them, they do not drain worth a DAMN. There are no drain holes, and I ended up drilling my own where the leather meets the rubber sole. I'm sure this hastened the deteriation of the boot, but it was better than getting trench foot. The laces wore out to the point of breaking (they are cheap 550 cord laces), but were easily replaced with free, Army-provided para cord.Bottom line, these boots will probably hold up better in the desert, than say...the draws and streams of Camp McCall, NC. Even then, don't expect them to last over 8 months. But, they are damn comfortable, to their credit."
264600,0,This is a generic big shoe of average manufacture and materials. It is clearly foreign but none of the cost savings of such outsourcing has been passed through to the consumer. It can be extrapolated that such behavior by the owners/managers of this company will overtime generate a market niche for an on-shore competitor to retake market share with potentially higher quality materials at the same price.
69000,0,"Bought for use with my llbean Cresta Hikers. I used Woodlore's sizing chart. In my case (10.5D), they are too narrow for the boots I own. Maybe they will be better for others"
245043,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
48676,1,I love these boots. They're so much fun! Don't let the height of the heel scare you...the platform actually makes the heel shorter when it comes to foot placement. Only problem - the laces don't stay laced when they're not on your feet. You'll have to relace them each time.
253703,1,Rockport Men's Astride are my favourite comfort shoes so when I needed a new pair I hit the stores trying to get a pair. All shops I went to had none in stock and of those who said they could get a pair in for me the cost was to be somewhere between AUD250 and AUD270. So I did what any person in need of shoes that were not readily available would do - I went on line to Amazon. In a matter of about 2 weeks (it could have been less) I had a pair of Rockport Men's Astride in my size and the colour I wanted all for around AUD68 INCLUDING POSTAGE!
278935,1,"Was surprised how hard it was to find shoe recommendations based on arch type (high arch, flat feet, etc.). Saw in a comment somebody liked the Asics GT-2110 for flat feet and decided to give them a try. They are the best shoes I have had for my flat feet, with good support and comfort.Shoes held up well, although I use them for regular use (not running). Felt light, breathe well, and fit well."
325646,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
305751,1,"These Rockport shoes have greatly helped my sore, sore feet. Since being in the military I have had problems with my feet. These are the first shoes to give me a measure of relief!"
120838,2,"These beautiful boots garnered many compliments and made my legs look great. But after four or five wearings, the cheap plastic zipper started disintegrating at the ankle (and I don't have thick ankles causing undo stress on the zipper.) Hoping it was a fluke, I exchanged them for an identical pair, and the zipper fell apart on them as well after just three wearings. I could have replaced the zipper for $40, but it's just a matter of time before some other shoddy component self-destructs. Luckily, Nordstrom's has a very gracious exchange/return policy. I won't be buying this footwear brand again."
352928,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear on vacation and they are fabulous! They were comfortable with no breaking in--the first day I wore them was the day I dealt with airport parking, walking and security. Also, I usually need a wide shoe, but found the medium width in the Leve Ballet Flat fit well and was perfectly comfortable."
296078,1,"If you walk on ice, you'll find these very nice. And much less expensive than a broken bone."
323017,1,"Loved the shoes, bought them for my mother and she is thoroughly enjoying them. Very comfortable and received shipment right away."
314836,1,"These are well-made boots and wide enough to be comfortable on my feet. The top is slightly narrow, so they will be snug on my calves. Great quality for the price."
294302,1,"These are really Great boots,............ I would recommend these for any growing boy, or girl,............ Just buy a half size larger!!!!!!"
127922,1,"I have had Eastland Paxtons (Dark Brown) for the past two years. I bought them at Shoe Carnival for $50. They have been comfortable since day one and look great. They are pretty light, which makes them easy to wear if you're on your feet all day. I oiled them once (about a year ago) which made them look almost new again. The tread on the soles is now flat and there are some holes on the inside lining, but they have stood up well for two years. I'm having trouble finding them again, I'd buy them again if I could find them. Yesterday, I bought the Eastland Starks which seem to be the same shoe without laces. Still getting used to them, but so far they are good."
132619,1,Our daughter is a dancer and its cheaper and easier to order her items online. These shipped fast and are holding up great!
30857,0,"The boots arrived on time, but I wasn't happy with the way they fit. They were heavier than I prefer and bigger than I wanted.I wound up donating the boots to a local church who was collecting for the victims of hurricane Sandy, so hopefully they found someone who could use them better than I.Quality-wise they appeared to be well made, so I had no problem with that. But I learned that, for me at least, I need to try boots on in person to make sure they feel right to me."
86905,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
96335,1,"Very comfortable. I have not climbed in them yet, so I can't comment on the durability, but the traction on the sole is excellent and they fit like a glove. I ended up getting them in the same size as my sneaker, and they are snug. Love the laces."
128539,1,Great looking shoe that can be dressed up or down. True to size and great dancing shoes with the leather soles.
115219,1,Use for auto-x and the thin sole allows for great pedal feedback. Took about a week or so before they were broken in nicely. Good comfy shoe with great pedal feedback and style.
129690,0,"I used to have these about 20 years ago. So I was looking for a new pair of shoes and not just some running sneakers which crap out after a month and offer no more support so I remembered how comfortable my Rockports were. I notice on this pair there is no mention of a ""Vibram"" bottom or sole it only says rockport stamped in the bottom sole. So now im thinking was it the vibram soles that made them so comfortable because these soles feel more like hard plastic and not that ""cushion-y"" feeling I used to love and swear by. So what happened to the vibram soles? Now that these are made in vietnam do you think they are cutting corners and saving some bucks by using these soles. Shame because they are a pretty nice looking shoe even if bland a little."
324019,1,"These work great!If you have or plan to make the investment in a good pair of shoes, I recommend investing in good shoe trees as well."
47546,1,they were comfortable
256297,1,This was a gift. It arrived on time for my 80 something year old grandmother's birthday. Even she thinks they are comfortable.
107058,1,Comfortable shoe. Nice deep white. Good leather uppers. Shoes really last. True to size. Wear at work at least 10 hours per day. Good support.
156257,1,"the Capezio Little Kid/big Kid Daisy Ballet shoes are very nicely made. The sizes run a hair small, so order about 1/2 size larger than shoe size. I ordered 2 sizes,not knowing which would fit from previous reviews.I ordered 1/2 size and 1 full size larger than her current shoe size. This worked to my advantage as my child is still growing and out grew the first pair within the first 2 weeks, so we were able to use both pairs, just not for very long with a growing kid. The product is worth the money in my opinion as they are well made. And according to our Ballet teacher, they were also properly made, with the strap in the correct place."
13418,1,"They're Chuck Taylor's. If you'll like them, you'll love these. Black high-top sneakers were a great gift for the scene girl with black everything"
347592,1,excelente..!! los recomiendo!! compra segura y a tiempo.! saludos desde ecuador! los zapatos llegaron a mi pais sin ninguna novedad..!!
263656,1,"First of all, the shoe came amazingly fast. In about 3 days, it was at my doorstep. When I tried it on, the cushioned sole was comfortable and everything was like it looks in the picture. BUT, the shoe did run a little narrow and a little bit short. Not enough to ruin the fit, but just enough for my toes to be against the front while walking. Therefore, I reccommend ordering .5 a size up."
221264,1,The bag arrived before the anticipated due date.The bag itself has more than enough pockets for organization of items carried by anyone for business or pleasure. Leather quality for the price is better than expected. All in all satisfied with the purchase and would purchase from this vendor again.
83619,1,"How do I love thee, Reef Ginger flip flops? Let me count the ways. I am only sad that I could not find a new beige-colored pair this season, because I buy you in every color. I walk the whole of Manhattan in them with no blisters, nothing but total comfort. Literally, these are the one pair of summer shoes I cannot do without."
250235,1,"It's hard to find a white tennis shoe that doesn't just look plain stupid these days. I hate the huge basketball puffy shoes and the super white polo club/preppy versions. So when I saw this shoe I had to have it. It is the right combo of both retro styling and unassuming 'I don't care' fashion. The shoes are really comfortable, durable as heck and just keep getting better looking the more they are broken in. I'm going to buy another pair because after 1 year of abuse I know I'm going to need a backup when they eventually disintegrate.I recommend the white with Navy myself. The white with black are a little too 'Run DMC'...though they wore Adidas....I know."
321643,1,"Extremely comfortable and goes with just about any casual outfit you have planned out.However, I recommend ordering a whole size down, as the shoe runs big and also stretches the more you wear the shoe."
142796,1,"These shoes are great! They are comfortable, well-made, and are very durable. This is my third pair, and I will continue to buy them."
260623,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
4727,1,"Wore these in the Air Force for about nine years. Tried a different boot this last go around and quickly realized my mistake. I love Corcoran boots and am glad I am wearing them again. I would highly recommend them as they are comfortable, secure and last a good amount of time with regular polishing."
37207,0,"I have worn Danner boots in the military for over 15 years. I have always worn a size 11EE. This boot in that size did NOT fit me. It was very narrow with a narrow toe box. I gave them 3 stars because they look like a well made boot and I seriously wish they would have fit. However, I do love my military issued Danners and give them 10 stars!!"
284834,0,Simply made but works well for starter tap dancers such as my son. He quit tap after a few months so the price was right considering.
320880,0,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old daughter. The leather is very good however the cut is very small and therefore does not fit.
171433,1,as I said I am a fan of easy spirit--was glad to get a bargain-and of course would recommend the product and Amazon for easy purchase
352991,0,"I got this months ago and honestly I never wear them, the size is a bit tricky, it's a bit short and narrow, my feet are narrow already, but they still are uncomfortable in these shoes. It's my first Minnetonka shoes and I don't think I'll get a second pair."
251471,1,My order was processed and shipped in amazing time. Thanks so much for your 5 Star Service
211189,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
139211,1,"This is the best running shoe I have ever owned! I had trouble with my LCL, not anymore. I used to start to get tired after 4 miles, I can go twice as long with these. If you have flat, narrow feet and small ankles, this is the shoe for you. Pretty good arch support. Could use more, but I'm not complaining!! I hope they never discontinue this shoe!"
76022,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
353780,1,I have had two pairs of these boots. The boots are very comfortable and are sized right for my foot. I use these boots in the snow and also when I go fishing. The waterproofing works very well. In my opinion a very good boot for price.
34930,0,"The sole is too heavy for the style of shoe. They are a bit too wide for a medium width. I love the look of them and the pink color is terrific, but they are heavy to walk in."
230765,0,"Was hoping to replace a pair from years before that we're worn to death. I was disappointed when these arrived, to find they have changed drastically from what I remember. The shoe box itself would have fit better. Like many quality brands that have gone offshore, they resemble a pair of shoes only in their outward appearance."
65833,1,muy bonitos tenis y a un buen precio y aparte me ahorre el pago del impuesto que me hubiera costado en una tienda local---
298466,1,"These fit well, are comfortable & arrived in rapid time. I don't care much for the lack of eyelets inside the shoe itself. But, all in all, a great deal for the moeny. The colors are very nice."
28279,1,"This is a nice pair of shoes.....my husband loves them because of the quality, feel, and look. Would recommend to anyone..."
82144,0,"Great shoe, a little hard to handle though. Practise makes perfect they say, so will keep trying! Excellent value! Lovely style."
253558,1,"I use this polish on my boots for the police academy. Excellent product does what it says, and is totally worth the money. Only downside is that once the can of polish is opened, it can't be resealed, so just throw some tinfoil over it and it wont dry up. Applicator pad works as does the shine cloth, gives an excellent shine if applied properly, and lasts for a long time."
7254,1,"I use these for walking, the first day, they hurt my feet a bit (most shoes do until they get broken in), but by the second and third day, I barely even knew they were on my feet. Sometimes I come home from walking and forget to take them off to put my flip flops on!"
205668,1,"These are perfect to keep my beautiful new boots fresh and new-looking. I use trees in most of my shoes, but these are the first ones of cedar that I've bought. I love the quality and scent of cedar! Highly recommend these."
368902,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
267044,1,"Got my third pair of these boots just 3 weeks ago and have been wearing them about 3 times a week and, just like the others I have had in the past, they are already comfortably broken in. Waterproofing has been very good and I re-spray them about once a year. Very good on trail with firm support especially good on rocky conditions. Relatively light weight."
371367,1,"I ordered this shoe in black leather with black patent trim. It would have been the perfect dressy flat shoe and I even ordered two sizes to try. Alas, neither fit well enough and both were uncomfortable. Hated having to send them back. I'm still searching for a comparable shoe."
232664,1,I purchased these for my 12 year old son who has a hard time getting ready in the morning for school! These are great slip on and slip off! The best is that they are great to wear when dressed up also as well as going to school everyday! My son was happy the minute he put his feet inside them and said they were perfect!
5754,0,I increased my width to 2E to accommodate a comfortable fit but it was still too close for a comfortable fit. You may need to go one size up to get a comfortable fit. It looks quite attractive on the foot however.
318270,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
372114,1,"Im not a big fan of sneakers, but these shoes I now want in every color. They are so comfortable and a must have to every college student. Love them!"
18460,1,"The product was delivered in two days' time, just as described. The shoes are comfortable and durable, I was very happy to find a pair for so cheap. The seller is very reliable!"
235038,1,I did not give this a 5 star only because the sizing was large. I always wear a 7.5 but these are wide on me.
207763,0,"I love these boots, very adorable, however they left dark rings around my calves even when I wore jeans inside the boots! Also, anytime I wore them in the snow my feet got wet even though snow never came over the top of the shoes!"
230426,1,"I purchased these boots for my cousin in England, who has trouble finding such a large size in a hunting boot. He said these boots are wide enough for his feet ( he usually wears 15W )eventhough they read Medium. He also said these boots are the best for keeping his feet warm while out in the fields in temperatures well below freezing. The fleecy type coating on the inside keeps feet dry and warm.He did comment one thing though......he said he spray paints the yellow strip around the boot, purely because it stands out too bright for real hunters like him. I do not have a clue as I am a City kid!!!!In any case, the boots are the best of the best and he is a World Champion Shooter.....Great Purchase indeed."
225529,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
172531,1,Great sneaker really comfortable like walking on air anybody who has a thing for old school gear should try these.
65162,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
109277,0,"I got these shoes in the camel-and-orange choice for $5 at urban outfitters LAST spring! I almost grabbed the black too, for that price! $48? please...."
255740,1,I ordered these shoes for my grandson in Michigan. I knew K-Swiss was good quality because my two sons used to wear this brand. The shoes fit my grandson perfectly.
124807,2,"I don't know about the other colors, which seem to look okay, but the pink color is terrible!!! The rub off really means messy and ugly spots of pink and white all over. It is not evenly ""rubbed on."" The shoe color is nothing like the picture. I am returning it."
19748,1,"My husband has had a pair of these for a few years and it came time to replace. He did not want to try any other brand/type and just reordered the same type, he likes them a lot! He says they are very comfortable, almost as tennis shoes, but they look professional. Very quick shipment."
389350,1,"Hi,Can anyone tell me how to buy the item? I can only select the size or the color, but never both, so I cannot buy the item. And I don't know how to contact the seller. Thank you!"
41378,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
207918,1,"These are way better than the hauraches I remember from the 70s & early 80s; they're built like better shoes, with some foot cushion and support. I liked the first pair so much, I ordered two more colors the next day and am equally thrilled with them all. Great looking for sun dress to jeans and anything in between.Also, my kudos to ShoeMall for a fair priced, well-packaged & quick ship!"
371890,1,"Great color to add to the collection. Own roughly 15 different pairs of New Balance 574s, currently. Have received many comments on the color from people. Make sure to spray with water proof/stain resistance before wearing to ensure long dirt free life. Would recommend to anyone looking for a colorful sneaker. Order a half size larger than you would normally wear as the shoe seems to run small."
76550,1,"I own another pair of the Mephisto Helen sandals which I've had for almost 10 years now. These sandals are comfortable, well made and I often get compliments on them too. All in all I'm very happy with them and would highly recommend :o)"
150433,1,These have got to be the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. The fit is perfect. The quality is flawless. I am sold. These are my first Enzo Angiolini's. And they certainly will not be my last.
242299,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
216128,0,"I bought the pink and green to go with my Bebe capelettes in the same colors. My feet are a size 3 kids but wide. I wear anywhere from a 6-8 depending on the style. This shoe is very narrow and pinches even more because of the band on top of the vamp. If you are to buy this shoe, unless your feet are narrow, go 1 size up. Otherwise, it will pinch too much and you just might rip the vamp off the side screws."
273617,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I ever had - even from the first moment I put them on. No breaking in necessary. I have received so many compliments on them - I am looking into getting the same shoes in some of the other colors. Highly recommended!
365112,1,"very good purchase for my daughter, she had a pair before and she wouldn't take them off unless she went to sleep so they worn out in almost 3 years, so i got this new pair for her for xmas, i'm sure she's gonna love them.perfect sizing and quality."
289814,1,I have worn this Softspots Stephanie shoe for many years in various colors. They are comfortable and can be worn with different styles of clothing.
94439,1,"I WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE WALKING SHOE'S, BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE RUNNING A BITNARROWER THAN MY OTHER BRAND OF WALKING SHOES. BUT I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.I AM AT AN AGE THAT I PREFER VERY COMFORTABLE WIDTH, AND SUPPORT. LOVED THEVELCRO. KEEP UP THE GREAT PRODUCT, PROPET. SINCERE TRUTHFUL, DH"
214484,1,"These shoes are so comfortable I don't even feel like taking them off at the end of the day! Walking is so comfortable with them that even my posture is improved naturaly, without even trying! Amazing how, unlike some shoes that advertise air-cushioned, etc., etc., ""technologies"", these shoes give me real natural comfort with style.I own a pair of Black and a pair of Tan color.They are so stylish that they make even your average clothes look better!Don't buy them, so only I will be the target of all those admiring eyes at work and in the community! :)"
99976,1,"The shoes are great. The leather is very soft, they are well made. Super comfortable with cushions inside. Super fashionable. Shiner than on the picture, but the color is the same."
325856,1,Very satisfy by the product and I was impresed with how fast I got the order.I will order again from this place for sure.
246952,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
191780,1,I've seen these boots for $300 on other online sites. This is my second pair of Danner boots and I will be a lifelong customer.
229825,1,"I've been wearing adidas Samba shoes for about four years now. I love the fit and feel of them. They are durable and haven't ripped or broken in any way, they just get very dirty after a few years, which I'm pretty sure all shoes have that problem.I often wear the mainly black ones, but as I was searching for a new pair of shoes I saw this color pattern (mainly white, black stripes). It's also cool, but still simple. I have had this pair of shoes for almost six months and it still looks great.I will say that I have pretty flat feet and somewhat narrow feet, and these shoes fit me perfectly. I'm not sure if they would work well for someone with wider feet, but to anyone else I would reccomend them. They are cool, feel great, and are durable. Very happy with my purchase."
227415,1,"These shoes are a classic and are very comfortable, but, you have to be careful or they will rip. mine ripped in the first month"
263099,1,"zapatos de excelente calidad, muy comodos para realizar cualquier actividad llegaron en el tiempo acordado y sin ninguna novedad los recomiendo ampliamente"
104746,0,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
286464,0,Anyone that says these shoes are amazingly comfortable has never tried on a pair of Rockports.That being said these shoes aren't UNcomfortable so much as they are wearable with minor discomfort. Basically they look better than they feel on the feet. But honestly for $30 I did not expect anymore. They do look snazzy and the size was accurate.
135576,1,This is my 3rd pair of the Carly sandals which I have bought over the past 5 years (in 2 different colors). They are very comfortable and go with almost any of the outfits which I wear. The service was excellent...very quick and great price. I could not find these shoes in a store.
171226,1,I just love Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip-Ons. For the last 4 years they are the only shoes I wear. I have diabetes and Easy Spirit shoes are the only shoes I can put on and wear for the full day.
165939,1,"Cheap shoes, doesnt look cheap at all, fun snickers well made, confortable. Wont regreat if you decide buying this pair. Good look"
283556,1,The new style of the T-macs. These are the best. They are very comfartable. I bought them the day they came out. If you are into black then buy them now. Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year. So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December. Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year.
350426,1,"Very cute, comfortable and true to size. You can wear them with, practically, everything, from casual to more dressed up attire."
215166,1,"I bought my first pair at a department store at a higher price. When I saw these were on sale, I had to get another pair. There were so many colors to choose from. Since my first pair was brown, I thought I'd get this Cotton color. So cute and comfy, I always get compliments when I wear them!"
268943,1,"I really enjoy wearing Rockport shoes. They fit well, as usual, right out of the box and there is never any breaking in period. A perfectly light weight walking shoe. Best shoes for the money !"
197103,1,"I love these shoes, great comfort---a little heavy, but you get used to it. I have had manyu compliments on these shoes."
184792,1,"these are the best flip-flops one can ever purchase. Extremely Comfortable, stylish, very very very long lasting. I had them for SIX (6)!!!! years and used them at the most. Now i will purchase several pairs to have them in colors and for my whole lifetime :)"
81596,1,These shoes are wonderful. The color is great and they arrived much quicker than I expected them to.
334692,1,"Awesome price for an awesome shoe, my son loves them. For anyone looking to save money on this product I would recommend them to purchase them for Amazon.com."
268772,1,I purchased the shoes for my son and he found them very comfortable. He loves them.
330801,1,"Danner is so good,the all friend of me are love it.The shoes with GTX make foot toDry and loose."
242373,1,"This makes my third pair of these little shoes, I have them in black, brown, and now white. They go with everything and so very comfortable. I would highly recommend them to anyone. Certainly worth the money!I wear them to work and they look and feel wonderful.Sign me Mootsie Tootsie Lover"
101822,1,She loved them - They were just like the shoes the real ballerinas wear. She put them on immediately and wore them all day. Nice leather bottoms.
321309,1,"i have had these ballet slippers for many years, this year i am fortunate enough to be able to order a few new pairs and as always i ADORE them! not to rough when first worn, very comfy and will last me a long time! thanks (O:also though i have a wide foot and ordered these 2 pair in wide , i didnt need to i could have used just the regualr width. the elastic ties will straighten that out for me just fine though so im keeping these."
138513,1,This is the 10th pair of Supernova Cushions I have purchased and I love them. They have a very thick cushion and it has cured my shin splints.
145720,0,I took a chance and purchased these as a Christmas gift. When I bought them I was not 100% sure they were real UGGs or not. When I contacted UGG they told me this company is not an authorized dealer and cautioned me that these might be knock-offs. When they arrived I noticed that these boots were made in China. I found that there are several dealers selling a lot of these on the internet and they are shipped from China. According to UGG and other sources (Norton for one)they are selling counterfeit boots. Bottom line is that so far these appear to be of good quality but I am still unsure if they are the real deal or knock-offs that are over priced.
1901,1,"i was hiking last sunday on the north east side of barbados, they protected my feet when i stepped the sea rocks along the shoreline.i used wear shoes and my feet are not longer wet i walked thru wet grass or i stepped into water.they are comfortable. i dont have worry about twristing my ankles no more or hurting my feet on jagged rocks.one hiking buddies stated that i must have on goat parts because he said, i was going very fast along the shoreline, sometime there was very little space for footing. i was going buy an other brand but when i saw them online, i wanted them! they are grrreeeaat!them light weight. before i bought the boots, i used wear a pair of running shoes and the rain comes or falls the night before! my feet would wet and will bring alot of discomforts to my feet but alas i have my htmaivwp hiking boots. they are great."
331541,1,"These crocs were a gift to my husband and he loves them! They may not be the cutest shoes, but very comfortable and he wears them all the time!"
147121,1,this was a christmas gift for my wife..she loves these things..keeps her feet warm..and make her heart feel warm with love.excellent gift..thanks amazon
314813,1,"Pros:Very comfortableGreat daily-wear shoes after you have put too many run miles on themRelatively lightweightAdequate supportGreat cushioningCons:Ugly as sinConstantly clicking or squeaking after they wear down a bitThe bottom edge of the shoe is rather jagged and I have nasty cuts on both ankles from when I accidentally nicked myself while runningPriceyI had always had trouble finding a shoe that worked for someone my size (6'7'', 220lbs.), but I was very impressed with these. I got a good 550 miles out of them in Summer 2008 and still wear them occasionally."
83130,0,"The sandals are cushy enough and seem sturdy, but the straps get twisted every time I put them on and if I don't take the time to straighten them out it makes it uncomfortable to walk. I've never had this problem with a pair of flip flops. Maybe the straps are too thin."
37930,1,"I have this shoe in black bought it in February at a great price from a discount store, they are ""simply"" one of the most comfortable shoes I have EVER worn!! I have had severe foot trauma, that required 9 different foot surgeries and have to wear very supportive shoes and I'm suppossed to use orthotic inserts in every thing I wear, but with this shoe I don't need them at all and I can be up on my feet for hours with no reprecussions at all. I loved this shoe so much that 2 weeks after I bought them my daughter accidentally left our new puppy in my bedroom where my new shoes happened to be as well, he liked them so much that he ate the entire tongue out of the shoe. I made my daughter go out that day with me and buy me another pair, I had to search a few places but it was well worth it, I should have bought the brown ones then as well now I am searching everywhere for them. I hope you all enjoy this shoe as much as I do."
386957,1,This show is so comfortable and looks great with anything. Light weight with clean lines. No need to wear them in. They are instantly comfortable.
277686,1,Simple great shoe. eS has been in the skate market for a long time but has yet to turn full hipster and still makes a quality skate shoe for those who need something durable and fashionable. I had my first pair of accels in 1999 and I can say that they have not changed a bit. They last forever and are very comfortable. I my self so not skate but I do a lot of walking/trail hiking and they are even good for that. I bought them originally for their durability but I keep buying them for their comfort and style.
23735,0,"I like these sandals, they are comfortable right out of the box. The only thing that makes this pair of sandals a three star, is the stink of plastic that emits from these. Brand new and used, still waiting for that new toxic plastic smell to disappear. Maybe BP has something to do with the manufacture of these."
193963,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
386147,1,shipped fast ordered around christmas at the last minute and were brand new as listed size was right have held up great
167871,0,"I'm a big fan of Teva products but these flip flops were just not doing it for me. I love the strappy criss-cross and the blue color, but after a while the straps were just too much trouble to readjust every time i put the shoes on. I've had shoes like this before and the straps gave a little, but these just weren't as comfortable and I didn't where them as much as I had wanted to. :("
227557,1,I ordered these and when I got them they were everything I thought they would be. I love em!
175061,0,I rated this shoe as average because the materials used are plastic feeling and very light weight. I purchased this same shoe many years ago and was impressed with the quality materials but this latest shoe is not of the same quality. Time will tell if it is as durable as my old pair. I would probably not recommend this shoe to a friend
349492,0,These boots last 5-6 years.I used them mostly for winter atving. I also studded the tred with hex head screws for traction on ice.
15843,1,"Three year old ""LOVES"" these shoes. Wants to wear them to bed.Arrived on time in perfect condition and the price was excellent."
48695,1,"Although the heel on these boots look kind of high, they are actually really comfortable and stable to walk in. I have weak ankles, so I was a little worried about it, but they have pretty good support. Make sure that you wear long socks otherwise your skin gets pretty sweaty in the boots. The only complaint that I have was that the tongue seemed to be a little too skinny. The boot fit around my leg and it's not like I have fat legs, but I had to make sure to tie them tight so that the skin didn't show from under the tongue."
46598,1,"I have done business with your company before, and everytime I have had a great experience. Thanks for the great products."
123586,0,"I wear a size 9D (US) and my order was very tight on my feet. You should consider ordering a larger size than you wear. The break-in was not that bad though. The stitching, sole and quality of the leather looks great, the polish - not so much. There were several cosmetic flaws on the pair I received (which I polished out.)For those on your feet all day like I am, I would suggest someDr. Scholl's Tri-Comfort Orthotics Inserts, Men's Size 8-12, 1-Pair Packages (Pack of 3)as these shoes are not good for (at least my) extended wear.All in all a nice shoe. I've always liked the Florsheim brand."
152406,1,I love these shoes! This is the first day I have worn them and they are so comfy! I have two other pair of Softwalk clogs and I adore them as well. I have narrow feet and they fit perfectly!
196691,1,"I am very pleased with my purchase! This is the perfect little across the body bag to hold your I.D., a couple of credit cards, keys and phone. I get tired of lugging around a big heavy bag filled with everything but the kitchen sink and this is the perfect solution. It is genuine leather which is a very soft and buttery texture."
256691,1,"Awesome shoes that I've bought several times over the years. I love the nondescript style and the (somewhat) retro look. Low key, nothing flashy but very cool.They're getting harder to find. Here's hoping Reebok keeps making these."
48247,1,"I love them ! Received them rather qickly , and they are so comfortable.now if i can keep my kids out of them !"
33066,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
189625,1,Easy to buy and very trusfull for a costumer overseas. Have never got a product from an overseasfirm which have lived up to my exc. That goes for both the product and the handling from amazonThank you
369052,1,"I grew up in Hawaii wearing these shoes and fifteen years later they are still an integral part of my wardrobe. I LOVE Sandies for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that they're an incredibly good deal. For $22, I get shoes that last an average of two years. They come in so many colors and each year, another one or two is added to the line. I wore these touring around Europe and Japan earlier this year--walking around all day, every day for over a week in each place--because they're much more comfortable than my Nikes etc., that cost five times as much. They go great with everything, and don't try to tell me different! A great investment at $22."
351702,2,"Am a long-time Minnetonka wearer - I live in a house with stone floors so I need a sturdy slipper! I bought these about a year ago. First off, even though I bought the usual size, they were skimplily made and snug. The materials are not up to the previous quality. My toe bust through the stitching within a couple of months and now I need to buy a replacement pair, but they won't be Minnetonka's."
134837,1,"The shoes worked great, right out of the box. I use them for Ultimate, and the first weekend I wore them, they performed nearly flawlessly. I had only worn them for one short hour long practice session before using them for an entire tournament weekend (7 games over two days). So they had not been broken in, and still I only got one hint of a hot spot (blister) on the back of my heel.The tread pattern worked great in the long grass field. The ground was definately soft, and the firm ground cleats dug in consistantly, providing traction in all the various movements required of Ultimate.Great Shoes, great tread pattern, no break in required! Buy 'em."
144321,1,I bought these shoes at full MSRP $49.99 at New Balance Shoes. From the moment I tried these shoes on my knee stopped hurting and even better because I have been wearing them for a year now and my knee trouble is totally gone. The only weakness I could find in the shoe was that the color fades a bit when you wear the shoes in the rain.
336722,1,"These boots are extremely comfortable. Awesome traction and very warm. These are a little on the heavy side but that doesn't stop me from giving them 5 stars. They also have a 6 month guarantee of being waterproof.I was out doing some chainsawing in the snowy woods of wisconsin and this boots kept me comfortable and my feet dry, warm, and safe. It is hard to find a warm boot that is also steel toe. I found it and it was money well spent. Thanks Rocky."
28126,1,"Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. The one thing she said she likes best is that ""it feels like they are giving your feet a hug"". The shoes seem put together well and the Miami Red is a great color. Very modern and fresh. Overall it was a fantastic purchase for back to school."
6793,0,"Bought for son, who loved the comfort. Within a few months, inner sole began peeling and the tongue has come almost completely off."
288922,1,"I've been buying Rockport shoes for about 15 years now. They're one of a few that have extra wide widths available (I wear an 11.5, W). They're very comfortable and long wearing. I use them for my everyday work shoes (office environment). Buying on line is great so that I don't have to go to a dozen local shoe stores looking for them. They're a little slippery on wet tile floors but grip well overall.Paid $58.90 and shipping was free. Purchased on 07-31-2009 directly from Amazon."
122884,0,I purchased these in a 7.5 wide but when I got them they didn't feel like a wide shoe even though that is what it said on the box. Better to buy shoes in person I guess.
95440,1,I was looking for a pair of shoes to wear around the house. Most slippers are too warm for me to wear since we live in California. This is a great pair of shoes to wear very comfortable and easy to slip on and off. Highly recommend to anyone.
299666,1,Love these shoes and they certainly help my feet. Will order more styles when I can afford them!
342619,1,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
368929,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
164313,2,Absolutely love this pair of sandals. I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon. I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available. I was lucky there was one left when I ordered. Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends. Its classic design will never get old. I hope I can find some from other websites.
104212,0,"I bought these for potential wedding shoes. They're very sexy, but they look like they would go along with a stripper pole. LOL Great value, cute shoes ... But, not what I would normally wear. Not to mention, very very uncomfortable!!"
331715,1,Surprisingly comfortable. Love to wear them when watering plants in my backyard. I wear size 13 shoe but 12 in a Croc. My German Shepherdloves them also..so beware..they must be kept out of your dog's reach!
291123,1,"I've worn this brand and style of slipper for years and years, and highly recommend them. Actually, I'm on Amazon's site right now to buy another pair for myself and for a friend. They are durable and comfortable, good for around the house, dance or exercise classes, and I always bring a pair or two when I visit Las Vegas. I also have a pair at work. If you're unsure on size, I recommend choosing the larger one. Say your shoe size is 7 1/2 or 8, buy size large. Seriously, you can't go wrong with these."
233611,1,"and e ep nice color, nice designe, nice adroit . . . this is your shoes, when you dress on ipath, you cannt stay one place, mooovee your......................!!!"
21617,0,These shoes make a squishing noise every step. They are comfortable but the noise is annoying.
304846,0,"These shoes look as nice in person as they do in the pictures, though they are a fair amount darker than in the pictures. They almost look black in dim lighting.The overall quality is average. They scuff easily and the scratches show a brighter brown/orange color. The air in the soles takes some getting used to...not sure if I like it or not. They are very light and the material is very thin - they feel kind of cheap.Also, they seem to run maybe a half-size too small. I normally wear a 9.5 to 10 and ordered a size 10. They are too tight unless I wear the thinnest socks I own.It may seem like I'm knocking these shoes, but that's not the case. Overall they are a nice shoe for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
254134,1,I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM.
326838,2,"I have been a big fan of Sperry shoes for a long time. This was the first pair of sneakers I had ordered from the company. I ordered my normal sneaker size (15) and upon trying them on, found out they ran a little big. Within my first 3 times wearing them (not doing anything special, just walking around the city), the bottom white rubber separated from the canvas portion. This is very disappointing from a company I love."
169422,1,I couldn't find these shoes in my size anywhere but I was glad I found them here. I love them they're so comfortable and they match with almost everything.
164555,0,"I have other pairs of this same style by Easy Spirit in the same size and this pair is really tight on my feet. I am trying to stretch these out with stretchers to make them fit better. Might want to consider ordering a half size up. Other than poor fit, they look nice. Color is not as pictured at all, it is more of a hot chocolate color."
13174,1,"I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and give great support. These are my second pair. The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that. Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that."
179413,1,"...Chuck Taylor All Stars are good for doing squats. That's why I buy them. A lot of athletic shoes have a good amount of padding on the bottom, which is fine for running, but while doing squats, makes my feet feel slightly wobbly. The Taylors allow my feet to stay firmly planted, which helps me maintain proper technique."
56994,1,"I wear these all the time! I really like that they came with the yellow and white laces. They have become a total staple in my wardrobe. Comfortable, cute, and versatile."
66958,1,"I ordered these a while back and I simply love them. They are fun, yet stylishly funky, and go with just about anything. The only downsides I can think of is that they don't have much traction, so I can't wear them as often as I would like during these long Wyoming winters.Go ahead and buy a pair! You won't regret it!"
71305,1,"Cheap shoes, doesnt look cheap at all, fun snickers well made, confortable. Wont regreat if you decide buying this pair. Good look"
339884,1,"Since Nike bought Converse the have altered the shoe. There used to be an extra piece of stitched canvas on the inner part just below the big toe and stitching through the back heal of the canvas. The show is basically the same, except without this extra stitching and canvas they do not last as long."
187032,1,"I had a hip replacement and bending over etc is not as easy as it use to be. Got other shoe horns, all metal or wood were just were not flexible and broke two wooden handle ones. Saw this one had flexibility and gave it a try. Very happy I did. Though the horn is a little thicker than most, I am glad it is the way it is for durability purposes. The length is just right for someone who is 5' 11"". Because it is flexible, no matter what angle I hold the handle, the horn flexes and foot slides in easily. It has made it easy to put on all my shoes without having to bend over. I also leave my shoes with shoe laces tied up and just slip them on now with shoe horn with ease and not have to continually tie/untie the shoe laces. I truly believe you do not need to have a hip replacement or other ailment that would behoove you to need this. It is nice not having to lift my foot up to finish sliding my shoes on. Ordered another one just to have it in two places where I put my shoes on. Why, I have work shoes stored in the garage for working outdoors. Will keep the 2nd one handy there. I highly recommend this shoe horn. I believe you will not regret it. It might not please everyone, but it did me."
36791,1,"If you're looking for a lightweight, casual, hang-around-in shoe, this is a perfect choice. It is comfortable and can be spot-cleaned. Machine washing is not recommended."
74097,0,"These shoes took a time warp out of the 80's. Since i like and dislike some stuff about the 80's mainly the clothing i gave this 3 stars.If you want to look ahead of the game in style in Germany, which is stuck in the 80's, buy these shoes and be adored buy the germans. (i just went to germany and the majority of the country is stuck in the 80's and just beginning 90's styles)"
250908,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
66487,1,"And as you wonder, what exactly is this &quot;shizzysweet&quot; that she speaks of, I will enumerate the qualities of the Comptons and you will understand. The body of the compton is made with a killer fabric, the orange is my favourite though I own both colors, that is thick and would take serious wear to do any kind of noticeable damage to them. The soles, and soul, are pretty substantial. Knowing lots of people who dig writing slogans and other assorted B.S. around the sole, the substantial sole gives space for soul. They're also good for those of us who are shoe-lacingly challenged (or time challenged) and just put the shoes on with the laces tied behind the tongue. You can slide them on like this without your feet sloshing all around in shoe and you falling over in front of your co-workers, looking like a dumb---er, okay, I'm getting off on a tangent. Whether you're a Ben Sherman sycophant or you've never heard of this Sherman guy before you will love these shoes and understand the &quot;shizzysweet&quot; label slapped on them."
29681,1,They were very nice slippers but I didn't need two pair. And they were too wide for me.
224195,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
221022,1,"Shoes came exactly as described, in a timely manner.I would recommend the Rockport Brand to anyone needing a nice looking, dress shoe that is also comfortable."
8430,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
59601,1,"This is my fifth set! These boots never fail me. If your looking for a great fitting, affordable and durable boot then these are for you! Thanks Hi Tec for the great product."
193923,1,"Call me stupid, because I tried them on in purple when I was in Boston last month, but didn't buy them... And now they're nowhere to be found in a size 9.5 or 10 anymore, I'm SO sad!"
79817,1,"These flip-flops are extremely comfortable once they form to your feet (which seems to take about a week), and hold up well to extensive wear. I wear mine on a daily basis for at least 8 months of the year, and have used them for everything from going to the store to short hikes in the woods. I'm now on my second pair, but the first pair lasted over 2 years under constant use, so I definitely feel I got my money's worth. The plain colored options (black and brown) are classy enough to wear with some skirts, making these flip-flops extremely versatile. I've worn them to amusement parks where I've been on my feet all day, on canoeing trips in the Everglades, and while hiking trails in PA and NJ parks, and I've never gotten blisters or had trouble with them not being comfortable. Can't recommend them highly enough!"
171915,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
225410,1,"You cant go wrong with Chucks. I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan. They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees. When I am back in the states, I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but I will never outgrow Chucks. I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping."
26589,1,These shoes are the best I have ever had; they fit just fine; they look great! And the price was right!ghl
122890,1,"I love these Skechers. I keep a pair in reserve, and wear them for everything, exercise as well as every day walking.The fit is great, and I have gotten many compliments on the style."
270644,1,"Nicest pair of slippers I've owned in quite a long time. Very comfortable and warm (at least, in these winter months). Am definitely going to purchase a couple more pairs. It's great to be able to go outside to the garage or to take the garbage out and not have to put on a pair of shoes."
230932,1,"These are the 2nd best court shoes I have ever owned (behind only the Prince racquetball shoes, which are very similar)."
151352,1,"I've never owned this brand before. But, I liked what I saw in the picture... They simply looked comfortable. And I was right. Their light weight, style and color was just what I was looking for.From my experience with these great shoes, I would buy this brand again."
191217,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
363972,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
20430,1,I have owned many pairs of this shoe. I have flat feet and bunions and these shoes fit my feet well and are so comfortable. I wash them in my washer and and air dry with a shoe form inside them. They are great!!!
202635,1,"Good shoe. Showed up in not really new condition even though they were still in the box. There were scuff marks on the leather. Anyways, not a big deal for boat shoes, good product, good company to buy from, cheap price. I am satisfied."
22704,1,"Comfortable as every pair of crocs I've wore. A classic and user friendly pair of clogs, even in hot weather."
359926,1,"Several people mentioned in their reviews that the shoe runs small. I didn't take their advice, ordered an 8 (usually wear between a 7.5 and 8), and had to return it for an 8.5. Fortunately, they were GREAT about the exchange, no hassle, no additional charge for shipping, and I received the larger shoe within a few days. Using them now for a theater production and the shoes look and feel great on stage."
317448,1,I love espadrille and was happy to see them back in style. I couldn't find them locally but there they were in Amazon. I love them. I bought a black pair at the same time.
22762,1,"Hands down a great product! It's comfy and sturdy, and my daughter loves it. Just wish she didn't outgrow this so fast..."
139574,1,I'm very happy with this purchase. I love my new navy Keds! They came quickly and fit great!
217931,1,"After seeing the popularity of this shoe, I decided to test it out myself and I am impressed. Although its not too comfortable, they hug your feet and don't slip off even when loose, which is exactly what I was aiming for."
358358,0,The shoe is nice but they run really small. I am not sure if this is how dance shoes are supposed to fit but I wear a size 9. So I bought a size 9..they were tight so I exchanged them for a 9.5...they are still tight in the toe area. Be careful!!
312182,1,This is a great shoe..... Very comfortable and well made..... Has a European look and great fit...... For the money you can't go wrong.....
54723,1,"The price was right, appreciated free shipping... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery... purchased for a gift, and it arrived the day I needed it... was worried it would not arrive"
153235,1,Easy Spirit Women's Traveltime Slip-OnThese shoes are great! I bought a pair for my 85 year old mother to try and she hasn't taken them off since. They are so comfortable and easy for her to put on. I wear them all winter with socks.
369622,1,This show is so comfortable and looks great with anything. Light weight with clean lines. No need to wear them in. They are instantly comfortable.
239121,1,i love natural comfort and own 3 pair of this brands platform wedges as i an totally into the bohemian look for summer. they are comfortable i work in retail so i am on my feet 6 to 12 hours a day and these do the job as far as me not limping home after a shift they are great for providing the hieght you need for all of your long wide leg jeans and pants minus the discomfort i would recommend going a half size up but thats because you should always size up when wearing heels particularly open toed ones since your foot will slide forward a bit while walking i would recommend this product and brand to anyone especially if you are wobbly on heels or just find them extremely uncomfortable id also recommend amazon.com because the service is great fast easy and hassle free
71097,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
94232,1,I love these shoes because they have Velcro straps and are easy to take on and off. They come in wide sizes and are very comfortable
170531,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
316690,1,My husband only likes Reeboks/and only likes white sneakers.These are perfect and a perfect price! He's been wearing themsince they arrived!
266759,1,"This is my third pair. The first finally wore out after 5 years of use in the yard and all around durring the winter and my second is reserved for just hiking, (they took me over the Indian Himilayas very nicely, thank you.)Light weight, inexpensive, and a good fit. I can recomend them. Oh Yea they truly are water proof till about 5 years old."
256551,1,"These shoes are great and have survived the wear & tear of my two year old son. I purchased the black color and was a little underwhelmed from a fashion perspective because the white shoe looks better then the black shoe. However, the shoe is very versatile because of the simple K-Swiss design and it is all black. I can pair them up with jeans and they go well with khakis. Also, the shoelaces do not easily come undone which should be standard for all toddler shoes, but I've purchased other pairs where the laces constantly come undone. The price was a good value for leather shoes."
316858,2,"I've had nothing but praise for New Balance shoes before I received these 609's. In the first three days of use, the heel padding wore through on both shoes (never happened so soon on my other NB shoes), so badly that I had a nasty blister on my left heel. A shoelace eyelet ripped out, too. I'm just surprised at how poorly these held up. I'm not ordering shoes online again. Better to get the right fitting shoe at a store."
325930,1,"You can't go wrong with this shoe, especially if you are a tried and true Birki lover like me. The black suede looks really rich, and as always, the comfort is superb."
270488,1,I have worn these for many years and will keep buying them as long as I can buy them. I usually get a year out of them. Very light but supportive. If you're looking for something comfortable and durable these are very good shoes and conservative enough that you can wear them working in an office.
125745,1,"just bought two more pairs, perfect heel,true to size, can walk all day in it."
334603,1,"This shoes are awesome; I had a pair when I was a teenager, love them then and whenI saw them again I fell in love with them all over.The quality is good, the comfort is great.I really encouraged everybody to buy this shoes.It is an excellent product from Clark's."
165355,1,"I have worn this style of Easy Spirit shoe for many years. I'm so thankful that it hasn't chaged. It's stylish, yet very comfortable and gives my feet excellent support. I thoroughly recommend it."
330476,0,"I bought the shoes for my husband. He says, ""The shoes are not comfortable. I like the colors and they look good but they are not comfortable at all. I will probably never buy this type again."""
62112,1,"All around better than Converse. Awesome shoe. Has a slight arch support which feels nice. All laces are a bit soft feeling, maybe all cotton, probably the first thing to wear out. If you wear your shoes out to oblivion like me."
94235,1,These are for my son for HS basketball. They worked fine. Held up fine. Look great and feel good on the court.
136942,1,It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
315364,2,"to PUT IT CRAP,i didnt get the ADDIDAS 11 ORIGINALS i requested,instead i recieved some awful T.MAC bigfoot basketball shoe,which i promptly gave to the local childrens hospital MERRY XMAS. BOB."
92439,1,was bought for my daughter! she wore them under she prom dress. She has many pairs of converse shoes! She loves them!
45256,1,"Bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. Super comfy, great quality! Would recommend them to everyone. Very nice."
345566,0,"i've been looking for mary jane's for a while and decided that i'd give these a try since they were so reasonably priced. they also come in wide sizes, and that's a plus. i just received them and i have yet to wear them. i did try them on. while they are super cute, they are also really big. my feet get wider the closer you get to my toes, so my feet are sort of like...ducks feet?! lol. anyway, i imagine these would be comfortable enough for people that have the longer second toe. my second toe is much shorter than my big toe, that combined with the duck-like shape of my feet, causes these shoes to be a bit uncomfortable. the way the toe area is designed it leaves a huge gap between my smaller toes and the end of the shoe, and presses my big toe into my other toes.i realize that the shape of my feet are not the norm, but i know a few other people with similar problems and i thought i'd point these things out. to be make it clear...the toe area has it's longest point in front of where the second toe would be. anyone with a wide width across their toes might find these uncomfortable.they are also a lot bigger than i expected. i usually wear a regular 9 1/2 and these wide width 9's feel a lot more like a 10 or a 10 1/2 to me.they are cute though."
102830,1,"My daughter needed them for a performance. I ordered them in a size 7 and she wears a 6. We tried them on at a local store first to be sure. I ordered them with a 2 day shipping and the arrived right on time. Overall, super satisfied with this purchase! Great product and great job by Amazon!"
321373,0,"These slippers were ok, but definitely run wide. In street shoes I wear a 10 or 10.5 and I often size up to an 11 in loafers or ballet flats to accomodate my slightly wide feet. I ordered a 10W since these slippers are not offered in an 11, and they were loose even with the drawstring completely tightened. I ended up exchanging for a pair of Blochs, which come in longer lengths."
342970,1,This shoe lives up to the Grasshopper name. Comfortable and washes well. It is true to size and cool on your feet.
255005,1,"Nice boots, very comfy. Still not sure about these crepe soles, doesnt feel like much impact resistance. Either way a great desert boot"
189211,1,"So far I'm extremely pleased with these shoes. Quite comfortable, stable and supportive. Really don't know what more you could ask for in a sub $40 pair of tennis shoes. Thus far they have exceeded my expectations."
131484,1,Love the sandals. Ordered black and would definitely order another pair. They have a true fit to the size ordered.
193564,1,"Cute, inexpensive, name band, Tennis shoe for my 6 year. She loves them & finds them very comfortable. It's cheaper to purchase them here on Amazon, rather than in a shoe store like; Footlocker, Shoe Carnival, or Kids Foot Locker"
289449,1,"best shoes i've bought. Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person, keeps your heel stable and supports. Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight.New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there, and in wide sizes. Highly recommended..."
188645,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
181929,0,I purchased these shoes because I have a hard time finding my size 5. I have purchased these before through another place and they seemed to be more comfortable and softer inside. I can only wear these for a short time before my feet start to hurt and I have to remove them.
373616,1,I looked high and low for this type of boot slipper. Deerfoams used to make them but apparently not anymore. When I wear sliipers I want them to keep my ankles warm too and these are perfect. I only gave four stars because within a month one of the pull straps broke. Otherwise I love them.
81752,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
82093,1,"This brand fits me very well, making it easy to order online which I have done more than a dozen times."
364965,1,"Lamentablemente, A&uacute;n no he recibido el producto que compr&eacute;. Todav&iacute;a estoy esperando respuesta del vendedor. Agradezco hacer lo APROPIADO a fin de saber &iquest;Qu&eacute; pas&oacute;?. Muchas gracias."
96296,2,"I ordered a pair at 6 1/2 WW (EE). For that size and width, according to standard sizing charts, the sole should be 3 3/4-4"" wide at the widest. These are 3 1/4"". According to standard size charts, that would be a C width at most.It's really too bad, as these appear to be very attractive boots otherwise. Why bother advertising and supporting widths if your widest size is so narrow."
112170,0,"I got these shoes in 2 days ago ... I had to place a pair of Heel insoles in them for a little more cushion, but over all they are great!!! Paired with the insoles, they are like walking on a cloud - the shoes are true to size.2/18/13 - So Fast forward a few months - These are not what I thought - no more walking on clouds - I had to put insoles in them after the 1st month and they squeeze the top of my foot too tightly- Have not been wearing them in the last month and 1/2. Purchased Sketchers Go Walk to replace them - Have insoles in these too for the heels, but It's more like walking on air and my feet can breathe."
4134,1,"I ordered these in fall when I was going for a backpacking trip and I could just forget about twisting an ankle or anything. Wear these, step on any kind of surface with confidence, lots of grip, good support for the ankle. Will highly recommend these for snow as well as adventure!!"
162561,0,"For the shoe, I dig the look, the ease and the functionality. The price is fine around fifty.The problem is here they want to say you save against an MSRP. Converse doesn't even sell their shoes on their site for the MSRP. The savings is fictional."
66937,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
299928,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
378433,1,"This is my first pair of character shoes that I was asked to purchase for an opera I am in at my school. I was very worried about ordering shoes online as I have a somewhat weird, pretty wide foot. I typically do not buy a wide size, however, and all of my shoes are either 9 or 9.5 (okay- the occasional 10 for my winter boots because of thick socks). I went up half a size and ordered in wide width based on Amazon's suggestion and all of the reviews. I immediately tried them on and they fit perfectly, and will fit great with a thin tight as well. Very happy I decided not to go up a full size as that wouldn't have worked. However, everybody is different, so trust your gut! They're very comfortable, well made, and I can't wait to use them on stage. Best of all, returns were free if they didn't fit!"
82435,2,"I clicked on the blue shoe, 5th in line on this page, and it was entitled ""Garden"" and I received green shoes. The green shoes that the official chacos website considers ""Garden"". I am very upset because if I am going to spend this much money on a pair of shoes, I expect to receive what I ordered and I did not."
203233,1,I got these for my daughter and she loves them. They are just as described and are very good quality.
14734,1,"These boots are comfortable from the very beginning. The leather is soft, supple and water resistannt, yet thick enough to provide adequate support. Fit is true to size and the black rubber sole blends perfectly with the black leather. The insole is removable, but not very substantial. At least it can be easily removed and replaced with a better insole. I would have liked to have seen speed-lace grommets for easier on/off capability and maybe a greater number lace pattern than the four this shoe provides. Other than that, it's a great shoe for the money, and I have yet to lose an inch square chunk from my sole, as the previous rater experienced."
195111,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
279388,1,Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse.
143175,1,"i have owned several pairs of these! they are the best sandals i have ever owned. the last pair lasted over 2 years and i wore them when i walked in the breast cancer 3-day walk....yes, i wore them to walk at least 40 of the 60+ miles of the three day and my feet felt better than they did when i walked with expensive running shoes! what makes them so awesome is how they conform to your feet! they feel better than walking barefoot! enjoy!"
350379,0,"I ordered these over a week ago after a long search for inexpensive Gore-Tex boots. They are comfortable, offer no pinch spots for my medium-volume feet, and performed well on a five-mile hike in 20 degree weather.I have two gripes - one, after such a short period, I've already noticed slight separation between the leather upper and the rubberized outer sole. Secondly, my sturdy-looking laces have already begun to fray and weaken in one spot.Both of these issues are minor, though, and easily repairable. I'm pleased with their waterproof qualities so far, and found nothing comparable in their price range."
348126,1,"I was very nervous ordering this shoe for my husband for Christmas, without him trying it on. After reading other reviews, I decided to do it, and I'm glad I did. He really likes the shoes and has commented on how comfortable they are. We will buy another pair in Brown!"
134147,0,"I bought these for my son, since he needs wide shoes to fit him comfortably, but these were really not wider than other shoes. Very disappointed."
189007,1,"I love crocs. I seriously can't believe I do, I mean I hated them for so long and finally gave in to all the excitement. To my surprise they are wonderful and comfortable and all around enjoyable. I wear them to the grocery store, to work, around the house and they never get old. If you're a doubter like I was, I say just try them, you'll never know how they feel until you do."
273829,1,"These boots might have an economy price, but they aren't cheap. They probably wouldn't stand up to road work, but for everything else they'll keep your feet dry and comfortable."
88698,1,"At first I thought these shoes seemed a little small. I wore them around the house for a while and they are correctly sized. I am happy with the look, feel and quality of this shoe."
40249,0,"The dye on these shoes comes off. I bought this to wear around the house and they are comfortable enough per the other reviews, but they turned the soles of my feet black after an hour of wearing it on the first day. My clean feet looked really dirty after wearing these although I was just walking around on carpet at home."
155972,1,"This is a very comfortable well wearing shoe. This is my second purchase. When the time comes to buy another new pair of shoes, if these are still available, I WILL buy another pair. My only problem was that the liner in my first pair wore out, after two years, before the rest of the shoe."
115510,1,"I love these shoes!! I have a pair of black and silvers and they really are my favorite pair of shoes. I'd say they give you at least a good inch in height, so my pants aren't dragging on the ground and it makes me look leaner. It's a simple style that is really good looking! I own the suede/nylon ones opposed to the all leather ones, and my only con about them is that the suede can fade due to too much walking in the snow or rain. This may be eliminating by spraying them and avoiding those conditions!! Otherwise they're comfortable and I wouldn't give em up for the world!!"
27759,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
188926,1,It's amazingly comfortable. It took about 2-3 days to break in the leather. The arch helps support my balance when walking and the shoes ventilate really well.
330600,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."
295758,1,"Disclaimer: I did not purchase these boots from Amazon, and I would recommend trying these on prior to purchase unless you don't mind exchanging them, but I feel that way about all shoes.I have had these boots and worn them just short of five days a week for over a year. The best thing about them is the sole, which feels like a pair of NB sneakers (read: good support, comfortable for all day wear). The construction is excellent, I got these for use riding a motorcycle, so they get a decent amount of wear, and in the past year the only noticeable damage is to the ribs along the vertical seams on the sides of the boots. The seams are all undamaged, just the edge of the leather has frayed some. For me, that is excellent. Normally, my sneakers will have torn seams, noticeable wear-through on the sole, and often the sole will start to become unglued. None of that has been an issue with these boots. Well-built and well-designed, sturdy and comfortable."
182447,1,"This is my 2nd time ordering these shoes. The shoes are well made, and long lasting. I feel like I am wearing house slippers when I wear these shoes yet they are supportive to my high arch. The shoes seem to run true to size. They are of good quality and long lasting. i highly recommend these shoes for those of us who do a lot of standing and/or walking."
205632,0,I ordered a pair of these shoes in size 12 EEEE and was not at all satisfied with the width of this shoe; it is at best a D or E width. Also the leather uppers are very stiff and will require extensive breaking in.
374535,1,Excellent made and very comfortable. I wear these shoes all the time. They are more comfortable when I am moving than when I sit. Highly recommend
294288,1,"speedy shipping, package arrived before estimated time of delivery.gladly do business with seller again any day of the week."
211226,0,"After reading multiple reviews that the wide is really not wide enough, I figured I would order a wide. I generally do not have a problem with regular shoes, although some feel slightly too narrow. I measured my foot which seemed to be between an M and a C/D, so I went with the wide since apparently it was not wide enough for most people. Unfortunately, the shoe is wayy to wide for me. I am generally between an 8 and an 8.5 and I went with the 8, which fits fine length wise.I got the wheatfield leather. I am a student and I walk at least a mile a day and live a generally active life, and I needed real shoes for my weak feet and ankles! I was hoping to wear them day-today and mostly at my restaurant, which has no dress code. I have been wearing slip on vans with 0 arch support. At the end of each 7-8 hour shift, my feet and legs ache and after I sit for a while after a shift, I end up hobbling around until my feet readjust to walking. These shoes seem like they'll help with much better support. I was hoping they would look even better than they do, but they look more like old lady shoes than I anticipated (I am 22, so perhaps I define old lady differently!). The top of the shoe ends pretty far down my foot, which means if I wear skinny jeans my socks will definitely show. I suppose this means I should start wearing matching socks.But I still think its worth it to return them for an M."
385664,1,"I love crocs. I seriously can't believe I do, I mean I hated them for so long and finally gave in to all the excitement. To my surprise they are wonderful and comfortable and all around enjoyable. I wear them to the grocery store, to work, around the house and they never get old. If you're a doubter like I was, I say just try them, you'll never know how they feel until you do."
135170,1,Very good fit and a great price. I would recommend the shoes to anyone. I prefer shoes from a company that makes shoes a part of their major product lines.
325088,1,For years my two sons have not been able to find a soccer shoe that properly fits their feet.So we special order size 15 for one son and a size 12 1/2 for the other. Neither shoe can be bought in stores. A size 12 is too small and a size 13 is too big. My sons have been using Copas for several years now and will probably keep getting them as long as they can be purchased in their sizes.
330699,1,"These are probably my eighth or ninth pair of Enzo Liberty Loafers. I have had them in many colors over the years; they wear well. I do have to replace my basic colors occasionally and these are replacing my old black ones. Thsey are comfortable from the first wearing forward, are a flattering fit and look good with casual and work clothes. When they are on sale, they are an unbeatable value."
325301,1,Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
4682,1,"Classic slaps, but with light and ""Cooshy"" Sanuk footbed...""Broken in"" feel right out of the box, Great price...Why aren't you ordering yours right now ?"
110245,0,"I bought these shoes because they supposedly have good arch support and help with pronation. Well, neither is true for me, but with my custom arch supports inserted in them, they are tolerable. I like how they look and they are comfortable otherwise. They fit true to size."
179714,1,"Ive worn Converse Hi-tops for 26 years,since I was a 13 year old skater.I saw my heroes growing up wearing them also-The Ramones,Stray Cats,The Dead Boys,etc. & various skateboarders of the 80s & 90s.Theyve been around for decades,& the design hasnt changed much.They are the most comfortable shoe in my opinion,and the Hi-tops give great ankle support for whatever sport or slampit its put thru."
269055,1,"Great,comfortable finally a sneaker in my B with not medium like Reebok etc. Fits nice and snug and wears well."
242136,1,"Very cool shoes, decent price and a very quick shipper. what more could you ask for?"
311302,1,These are amazing! The most comfortable walking/hiking shoe ever. I have no regret about purchasing these. They are great.
246736,1,"just love these boots. needed a plain black pair.. didnt want a heavy boot or a ridiculous price. so of course i went to Amazon and looked for timberland boots. my favorite place to shop and my favorite boot manufacturer. got a great price- fast delivery and a pair of boots in perfect condition. very happy with this purchase. i am a womens size 7= a 5.5 big kid in almost all timberlands. this is the only place that gives me the 3 things i need when buying tims, size,variety of design and prices i love! best part is i can shop in my pajamas :)"
82084,1,Great shoe! Love the selection of colors! A must have!
340871,1,These are nice and soft slippers but they are very large around the they were much to short for the given size. I kept them only because I knew they would stretch a bit and have but still to short which is sad. I do not like slippers with rubber or synthetic soles for our doors and these are soft leather which is why I bought them.
264304,1,"I am in LOVE with these boots! They fit great and are oh-so comfortable. I bought these to wear because they are so versatile and go with absolutely everything. I have worn them with shorts, jeans and they look great with dresses! Now that I own a pair of Ariat boots, I am hooked!!! The only odd thing about the boots is the way they size them. I normally wear a 9.5, but I had to get these in a 9.5 wide because the fit is so narrow."
344059,1,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was &#34;dated&#34; in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
93790,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress. Furthermore, on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are. I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry. 5 stars from me."
90866,1,Got a fantastic deal on these shoes and am very pleased!!
372014,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
379393,2,"I ran in every generation of this stability-control shoe since gen-2. By gen-9 they have totally trashed the shoe. The ride for slight over-pronators has definitely degraded, but the maddening and absolutely inexcusable design flaw is the d*mned squeak that sets in anywhere between 50 & 125 miles of use. There's a tubular insert in the heal (just look at the bottom)that obviously loosens fairly quickly and then--squeak-squeak-squeak...every plant! (even when you're walking.)I've moved on to Mizuno Nirvana's--heavier, but what a great ride. Farewell, Adidas, I guess you didn't love me as much as I did you. Your loss, though, and likely forever."
70690,1,"I really enjoyed these tennis shoes. I had never heard of them until my husband saw they were recommended in consumer reports, and I felt that they were very comfortable. It is time I buy a new pair..."
209369,0,"I have a wide toe box, but a narrow heel. Wide 4E widths in New Balance or Asics fit me fine in the toe box and heel. The Spira in a 4E was a tad narrow in the toes and my heel popped up and down. Their wide width would be great for those with big, huge, fat wide feet all around, or those with wide heels. I tried Spiras a few years ago, and could feel the spring in my step, but NOT with these. And the cheap Chinese craftsmanship was very apparent--I had to cut the top holes of the shoes all the way through myself with scissor tips to make the laces go through. These classics were a real let-down and have promptly been returned."
190845,1,"For a person with a high arch and skinny heel, I have had a really hard time finding a fashion athletic shoe that fits right and stays put! This style is great - love the larger criss cross elastic straps."
23902,1,"Very nice leather version of a classic. significant savings over surf shops for same sandal. Needed a couple of weeks to break in, but now very comfortable, and I always have a bottle opener on hand (or under foot, whatever)."
105532,1,"These shoes look so comfortable and cool. I wish i could get them, but I think they're way too expensive!"
266274,0,I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it.
336045,1,"I have always enjoyed the sensation of allowing my feet to be free and bare, however it's not possible to safely wander the world barefoot anymore. I discovered crocs almost three years ago. Since that fateful afternoon, I've worn nothing else (aside from the necessary pair of galoshes during the very wet days). I work as a preschool teacher, I am on my feet all day, running around, walking, standing, scrunching, taking my shoes on and off, and these are the only thing I willingly wear. I refuse to be bothered with pretty, comfort is my king! I wear them with socks because walking in tanbark can cause discomfort, and I usually do wear them in the rain and just carry socks in my bag. Since I wear these daily, they do tend to wear out after a handful of months and need to be replaced. The cost is low enough that it's still cheap enough to consider. Plus, there is no question, these shoes are always comfortable, every time with every new pair (I've gone through several). It seems unrealistic to expect that such a comfortable shoe will last forever. I highly recommend these shoes, I will be heart broken if they ever take these off the market!"
366493,1,"My first pair of the keen sandals, I love them. They are very comfortable. I purchased them through Amazon at a very reasonable price, they usually cost in the hundred dollar range. That's all I have to say about that!"
124695,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
69812,1,"I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005. I got the Pine green, a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort. I am ordering another pair in Charcoal, as I want 2 pairs to have at both places I live. It's all about comfort for me when I am home, so these fit the bill. Good value as well."
99474,0,I bought this shoe because others mentioned how comfortable it is and I work on retail and my job is essentially an eight hour workout. They were comfortable when I put them on but by the end of the day the bottoms of my feet were hurting bigtime. A pair of Dr. Scholles (sp?) fixed that but it is something a buyer should be aware of
277121,1,This shoe is very comfortable and am planning on purchasing another pair. Glad I was able to find mens size 14.
385475,1,"Excellent quality shoes, great price and they look great with work clothes or for Friday after work outing...Love these shoes. I wish I could find another pair!"
282982,0,"I love these Eastland shoes but can't seem to find them anymore. I was excited to see them on Amazon as my old pair is looking quite worn. When I got them, they were too small! I guess I learned my lesson and won't purchase shoes online again. I just did my first ever return to Amazon and will see how that goes. By the way, I have worn the same size shoes for years!"
370640,1,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
305634,0,I bought these shoes because I have foot problems and my doc said they could help me walk better. They really did- for about 2 months. They stretched out quite a bit and no longer gave the support I needed. That's not good enough for the price. Now I am looking for something better.
5581,0,"I purchased the pink Highlander Sheepskin Cuff Bootie slipper. I wear size 8 1/2 shoe and ordered the size 9 slipper. At first I thought it felt a little snug in the toe area on the top of my foot, but after wearing them 3-4 times, this area loosened up and they fit just right. After a year of wear, they have become plenty loose enough - that's how sheepskin works.These slippers have the traditional slipper thickness for the sole, which some reviewers did not like - they wanted more padding. After about a year of wearing these, I would agree. The sole could benefit from thicker padding, as it would add to the overall warmth factor of this slipper. The bottoms of my feet still feel the cold from the floor in the winter, although my feet generally stay warm enough in spite of this. The cuffs are warm and sort and you can fold them up or down.These slippers are fine for the price, and if you live in a relatively warm climate where the winters stay above 32 degrees Fahrenheit, they will provide more than adequate warmth. If you need a thick-soled slipper for whatever reason, I would recommend you look at something else. I doubt these will ever wear out - sheepskin is sturdy stuff. As a side note, these are cute pink slippers."
128182,0,"I think these are nice. Nothing extravagantly fancy, just good boots at a good price. the leather is soft. I bought a size up and I think I could have gone down half a size. Heel is high but not too high, and they walk comfortably."
332479,1,"Good shoes for the price. Havent had a bad day in them so far. That includes all the excessive daily usage as well as the great compliments. Only con I can see is that maintaining the shine it came with, does require a bit of an effort. But it pales in comparison to the comfort of these great shoes. Must buy for office goers!"
184153,1,"These are not just super cute and perfect for fall but they are actually comfy. Thanks to the other reviews on sizing I ordered a 7 but I am a 7.5. THey do run a little big! Also shipping was super safe!Overall, completely satisfied!"
145831,1,"I have bought this shoe for work, play and just plain walking for 5 years. They are the best. I use special insoles inside and I have the best fit and feel ever. Highly recommend them to everyone."
97319,1,I have purchased two pairs of these brand shoes and I love them both. I wish they were in other colors. I put them on right out of the box and wore them all day. I also wear them on sunday when I come home from church. I would recomend to any one looking for comfortable walking shoes.
73641,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
190823,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
192818,0,"I'm a Vans girl, but these were on sale dirt cheap and I needed a pair of brown shoes because black doesn't really match everything no matter how many people insist that it does. These shoes are very comfortable, and if I were basing the review on comfort alone they'd get closer to five stars. However, they're not easy to slip into. They require tugging and pulling, which wears on the back of the shoe. Mine are already starting to break down, and I've only worn them a few dozen times at most. If I had paid any more than $16 for these, I'd be pretty ticked off. But since they were cheap, and they are comfortable, I'll let it slide."
124414,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
38028,1,I had been out of bowling for over 12 years and didn't have my old shoesany longer so I purchased these shoes and I'm very glad I did. These arevery well made shoes and are extremely comfortable to ware.
187090,0,"These shoes are beautiful and look great on, but aren't that comfortable. I love them, but I don't wear them for more than an hour or two without having to take them off."
312063,1,"I bought the shoes about 6 months ago and they still look nice. Even though your not supposed to get them wet, I have worn them in the rain and you cant even tell."
326267,1,I have been running in the top of line New Balance for over ten years and have bought every top brand running shoe to try to compare. Even though they are overpriced - still best shoe on market - especially for those with injury or pronation problems as I have.
309830,1,A little long but fit well overall. Width is fine for me (I'm a little wider than normal/medium usually).Check around for price - I got these off amazon for around $30.
381408,1,Bought these for my daughter as she is in a musical and needed a good shoe. Great heel height for her and the shoe fit true to her normal shoe size. Very fast delivery too! Thanks Amazon!
339351,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
348305,1,"I haven't had these for too long, but, so far so good. Soft leather with rubber soles. Double stitched for the most part. I ordered a 1/2 size smaller as they recommend, and they are a perfect fit. Nice color brown, with a small black beading down each side. Inside says made in China. Nevertheless, a lot of boot for little money. Only time will tell, how well they wear."
264604,1,"These were purchased for my fiance to wear in our upcoming wedding. They are all leather, even the soles. They have a classic look and will last for years to come."
49765,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend.

302638,1,I ordered these for my husband & I was really happy how quickly and easisly we received this order.
172511,1,Great product and fit is true to size. Has fairly roomy width even though it is not designated as a wide width.
254668,1,"These boots are fantastic. The suede is soft and comfortable, and it keeps your feet warm in cold weather. I wear a size 11.5 normally, and I had to buy a size 10 in Clarks. I would suggest going to a Clarks store and trying on the boots before buying them online, because most people who buy these online end up exchanging them for the smaller size.Overall, these are the best boots I have ever owned. 10/10, would recommend to friend/coworker/lover/enemy/stranger/third cousin/in-law/deceased relative/deceased stranger/pet dog."
97569,1,The shoes were perfect and just what an elite player is looking for.
357117,0,"I ordered up a size from normal, but the shoe was still very tight. I sent it back and ordered a size up- wide. They have not yet arrived.Shoe looks well made, but since they were so tight, I never tried them for dancing."
19864,2,"typical low-grade Chinese product. Didn't fit properly, smaller than the size ordered and was too narrow. Too expensive to boot."
148704,1,"The workmanship of these shoes is fantastic, great soft leather, stitching is superb and the soles are very smooth. The only downside is that my feet are very wide and although I purchased the ""W"" width shoes, they are still a bit narrow. I have been using the shoes for just over 2 months and the leather has stretched a bit, but the shoes are still a little snug in the width. If you have wide feet, these shoes may work, but be ready for some break-in time."
139351,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
318734,0,"Now, if you're a typical person, you'd probably find this shoe to be soft under foot. However, I stand for hours a day (teaching) and I found this shoe to be lacking. It ain't soft enough for my long-suffering feet and it's certainly less comfortable than a typical running shoe. If your workplace allows you to wear running shoes, just do it. You'll be happy you did. In that case, may I recommend to you the Asics GT-2170? It has a super-soft MIDSOLE, which is the IMPORTANT PART for comfort. I'm basically a shoe expert at this point in my life, and I must advise those who are looking for a comfortable shoe--I mean really soft!--to LOOK UNDER THE INSOLE AND PRESS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE MIDSOLE. If the midsole (under the insole) is hard, or even hard-ish, you will NOT be comfortable unless you have numb feet that are immune to pressure. So don't be fooled by super-soft-feeling insoles made of puffy, fluffy, light foam. They will compress on top of a hard midsole, and you'll be hurtin' and as irritated as two wet cats in a bag."
276446,1,So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.
326968,0,"I recently bought these shoes and the similarly designed 'sandy' sandals (Reef Sandy Sandal - Women's). I prefer the sandy design much more. While these shoes are cute, and come in cute colors, the shoe is kind of narrow, and the thinner strap is difficult to slide into. For the price, it is worth it to spend the few extra dollars, and get the sandy's."
117727,0,"I had read the reviews to order bigger, because they run small, so I did. I ordered a full size larger, and they were still too small. I also ordered narrow, and they weren't very narrow. I had to send them back, and did not order a different size, because I didn't get the full refund. Very cute, but not worth it."
248247,0,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
26748,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
137105,1,"The shoes arrived at the earliest date promised, just in time for their use in a break dance performance."
89884,1,"This is a great shoe, one of the best I've ever purchased. This shoe has it all, comfort, style, and fit. If you have a wide foot or a high instep, this shoe will still be comfortable on your foot. This is a great shoe for anyone who has to be on their feet for long periods of time. It looks especially nice with jeans or other causal pants."
177990,1,Excellent shoe for summer wear. They are a great shoe for this price and comforable.
101529,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
281991,1,"My wife for a month tried to convince me not to buy these sandals. As a man, you only wear 1 pair of sandals. She owns at least 30 pairs in different colors, styles and the like, Old Navy, Gap, Havianna I could keep going, but I digress. I bought a pair when I went to Cali a few years ago, she called them dingy and made me get rid of them, I regret it! I finally insisted on buying these. They are the best sandals hands down. don't let the price sway you. these will become your every day sandal. they have superior craftsmanship and are made of very durable leather material. The sole is very durable and can withstand day to day walks on concrete sidewalks. I wear them religiously throughout the summer months. invest in a pair and I promise you'll be back for another in a few years when they need replacing."
124265,1,"First off, as a guy size 12 man, I bought the size 14 woman. This is for a Halloween Costume party. This should be a good shocker to my friends. I love having the lace in the front due to my thick legs. This allowed me to lace it to where i could use just the side zippers and not have it too tight. Looks sexy and is going to be the highlight of this party. If any other men are looking into this boot, the 3 side belt straps might become to short to wrap around depending on your leg thickness.Great Buy!!! Great Price"
302182,1,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR TEAM, THEY ARE TRULY RELIABLE AND TIMELY I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PROVIDER AMONG MY FRIENDS."
97268,1,"I foolishly bought 2 orders of these and had to return one of them, so please note: THESE BOOT SHAPERS COME IN SETS OF TWO. That said, they are great; very easy to put in your boots and they don't seem to be stretching out the leather. Nice and tall as well, they work great on my knee-length boots."
186112,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
335656,1,"Many times I slipped in the shower either at home or at the gym, beside on wet store-floors on rainy days but after I bought this product I have the peace of mind because the non-slip sole is a great protection. I love this product, it's worth the money. The only thing I would like the manufacturer to change in this product is the strong smell of new rubber that stays for weeks. I'm planning to buy more of those Crocs in different colors.Please note that not all of this Crocs are non slip, make sure it's non-slip before you buy."
41841,0,"I bought this shoe bacause I have a wide foot and this was one of the few shoes I could get online at 12EEE. The sneaker is very comfortable for walking. It is terrible for running though, my feet would really hurt after running in these shoes. If you are going to do any running DON'T BUY THIS SHOE! Otherwise, I think its a very good sneaker."
316097,1,Thank you so much for the amazing service - very quick delivery and the product is just what we needed for my dad. It is an ideal choice or anyone with foot problems. A very comfortable shoe enabling plenty of miles walking. Thanks again.
263661,0,The would be great boots if I could get them on my feet easier. Quality of the boot is very good but not easy to put on.
146390,1,These are exactly what my daughter wanted. She was super excited when she opened them Christmas morning. Perfect color and absolute quality materials.
192397,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
372368,2,"To be fair, there's nothing really wrong with these slippers. However, I found the quality somewhat subpar. Looks and feels like any cheap pair you can get in Chinatown. For the price, I expected a little better. Looks better in the picture than in reality - very plain, and something that your grandma would wear. Definitely not for a younger person unless you like the frumpy look. My last annoyance was the comfort factor. Now, I'm the type of person who can overlook A LOT as long as it's comfortable. This is not all that comfy as the reviews lead one to believe. The foot bed is hard and inflexible. It also makes loud noises when worn on hard floors, so wearing it around the house can be annoying for others. So, all in all, I'm going to trash these at the earliest opportunity and get something else."
239214,1,"The customer ratings speak volumes. Yes, this is a comfortable and highly functional shoe. Yet, I had never seen the Propet brand in any shoe store, and that includes several states. I first became aware of this brand on Amazon. thank you, Amazon! This was the first Propet I ordered and since then, have ordered several more. However, I do wish that all the colors in all sizes were available. I would be purchasing more if that becomes the case."
314711,1,The Reebok Amaze mid is a comfortable shoe that also provides great ankle support and a cool look. These shoes can match any outfit you have and make people look twice. Highly reccomended
301657,1,I bought these on sale just to try out. I use them as a work shoe and a walking shoe. They are very comfortable and durable. They are also easy to slip on. If you get a chance buy them and try out.
205611,0,"Bought this after reading so many good reviews. My first Dunham.Like-well built and tough. Leather looks like it will outlast the sole-firm wide sole but not too hard-good insole-wide sizes available-multiple purpose shoe - can use for office, street, parks, grass, gravelDon't like-leather is very stiff, not like Clarks. But my feet feels well protected like a work boot.-not suitable for formal/dress-up, but Ok for business casual - looks a little like a work boot-leather has no shine (unlike the pic) - like a work boot again-feels hot after a day's wear. Leather is not very breathableIf you're looking for a tough shoe with lots of wear for a casual or semi formal occasion, this may suit.But leather is way too stiff for my liking - just reminds me of a work boot.Sole is great for all types of ground."
133541,1,I absolutely love love love these boots!!! I'm a New Yorker living in Atlanta and im so used to wearing these boots so i was super excited to find them on Amazon...On top of the fast shipping they arrived before Christmas...These are my work boots and they were packaged just right... I'm very thankful...and great job Amazon!!
50197,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
212971,1,"These shoes were too big for a woman size 10 feet. So I sold it on Ebay, but they were a nice bright color."
215146,0,Hot looking shoes but not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Very true to size.
162682,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
136521,1,"They're Chuck Taylor's. If you'll like them, you'll love these. Black high-top sneakers were a great gift for the scene girl with black everything"
262809,1,very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!
317901,1,"Bought for my 2 year old son who has very sweaty feet and make even antimicrobial expensive sandals (Tevas) smell so horrible (even with foot powder!). Wanted closed toe sandals, but breathable shoes that won't make his feet smell after use. These did the trick! He seems comfortable in the shoes, runs around without tripping, dragging or falling off his thin feet, and have yet to make any red marks from rubbing or poor fit. They are also very light and flexible so his gait doesn't have to adjust for heavy footwear. Love how they are a closed toe, breathable option as it protects his feet from toe stubbing or cuts (unlike flip flops) when he's most active. Have also gotten them wet, and they dry up quickly unlike other sandals we've tried. Love love love them"
296244,1,"I bought my wife a pair of these because she is pregnant, so I wanted to make sure she is safe walking through the parking lot of her work during winter weather. It was extremely easy to get on and off of her shoes, and most importantly, they have kept her from slipping in the snow and ice."
92590,2,"I bought these when I bought the suit I wore to my wedding. I squeaked all the way down the aisle. I squeaked at the reception. I squeak on my way to work. I squeak whenever I go to the copier. I squeak whenever I do anything in these incredibly poor quality, blister-inducing, noise-making, overpriced shoes. I kept them past the return time frame because I figured they just needed to be worn in. Two months of wear and they still squeak nice and loud whenever I move, they still hurt my feet, and they scuff VERY easily. I took them back to Macys today and they told me to try putting felt on the areas that rub together causing the squeak. For nearly $100 I shouldnt have to make a trip to a craft store so that my shoes dont make noise.In short: I hate these shoes. I could have bought two pairs of better shoes for what I spend on these. They make noise and are very uncomfortable. This was the last time I'll ever buy kenneth cole shoes. Truth be told, I'm not a fan of anything they make, its all walmart quality at three times the price."
111613,1,"I owned several of these back in the day, and they still stand as one of most comfortable shoes of that era."
80186,1,"This purse was just what I wanted!! Big enough for everything, but not too bulky!"
305409,1,I wish shoe makers would make 1/2 sizes. i purchased a 9b and it fit a little loose. I wear a 8 1/2 shoe and a 8 would have been to small and a 9 is a little to big. What is the problem with shoe makers making 1/2 sizes in these type shoes. Other wise the shoe feel good and since it is hard to find a red shoe in that style I like it.
34119,1,"The shoe runs narrow. The inside label says both &#34;B&#34; and &#34;D&#34;, B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath. I don't know what that means, I ordered D width, but they seem to be a B width by appearance. HOWEVER, they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet! They are well-made and quite attractive, I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts. I am going to order more."
99442,0,"I actually returned these, because although I typically wear a 9.5, the 9.5 was pretty small here. The arch area is quite narrow...so your feet are hanging over that area. Not a huge problem, but it contributes to a feeling of instability.Not terribly long, either--go one half size up from your typical size.I didn't love the heel, either, as it narrows to a point from a wider area. It gives you a little ""hoof"" appearance, which isn't great if you have big calves. Best for thin women with thin ankles and calves.Be aware that the leather on the sides is metallic!!!! Very 80s.A neat shoe, but just not one I thought I would get any wear out of..."
323639,1,"They are good looking, modern, and very comfortable. They look nice enough on my feet, and will help me a lot for different casual ocassions. I have to admit that I was looking for something a bit less sporty, but after giving them a try I decided that I will manage just fine! The material is leather, a thick one and nice too. The picture is very accurate."
63958,1,"My mother has long, narrow feet and has had difficulty finding a good fit. This was convenient and a perfect fit. She's delighted -- and so am I."
14315,1,"I live in Michigan and work in the elements 95% of the time. I found the Danner Telson boots to be decent all-season duty boots.Prior to the Telsons I had a pair of Danner Acadia boots that gave me five solid years of work but they eventually got pretty sad looking with slick soles so I had to move them to the motorcycle wardrobe where they still serve.The reason I changed to the Telson was that I needed something more comfortable to stand on all day, and I needed a pair of boots that would allow me to run easier. The heavy lug sole on the Acadia was extremely durable and fine for walking around but if I spent a day standing in one spot (court security or directing traffic) my lower back and feet would just ache. In addition, if I had to chase someone down it felt like I was running on bricks. The Telson solved both issues. They fit more like a gym shoe, they are much lighter, the sole is more flexible, and the leather is softer than the Acadia. I would even argue that they are a bit more slip resistant due to the running shoe type sole over the lug sole.The biggest con to the Telson is that you give up quite a bit of durability by making them lighter and more comfortable. I just finished three years on the Telsons and the soles are now completely smooth with no traction left and the softer leather upper is so warn that they just laugh at me when I pull out the polish. Over their life the Telsons were much harder to keep looking Class A than the Acadias due to the exterior plastic-like ankle support and the softer leather. Speaking of the ankle support, I understand that they were designed with the exterior support rather than the steel shank in the sole in order to keep the boots lighter and more flexible which worked for the most part, but I wouldn't necessarily call the Telson boots ""highly supportive"".In the end it was nice to pay the cheaper price (vs Acadia) but considering that I lost 2 years of service I'm not sure it was much of a savings. I still find the Telsons pretty comfortable overall and they are certainly better for running/agility but I think I'll keep searching for ""the perfect duty boot"" since these are just OK."
46572,1,"I was a little dissapointed. I got one of these clutches several years ago that I liked better. The inner zip section of this purses zipper pull is hard to get a hold of in the tight confines of it's placement making it difficult to use. On my original clutch this zip section was on the inner back piece which was more convenient with more space for the zipper pull. I was expecting a second section for bills. I got used to being able to separate receipts, coupons and even amounts of money that I miss very much. I like the 6 card slots but prefer the old one with 3 slots and a coin purse on the other side. The zipper section on the back of the purse is great. The shoulder strap on both purses (old and new)is much to long. I have had to shorten them by 13 inches. This clutch is not as organization friendly as the old one. They measure the same but this one is a bit lacking, but it is the closest I can find."
125260,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
352123,1,"The slippers are extremely comfortable, are wearing well and because they are leather, don't cause foot perspiration. They were a gift but are the best pair of slippers I've owned in some years."
167274,1,Shoes came in very quickly. Exactly as described only difference is that the Wide shoe isnt as wide as it states. I would have gotten extra wide if I had known it runs a bit on the small side.
386511,1,"MY SON HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THESES SNEAKERS TO REPLACE THE ONES HE HAD BOUGHT YEARS AGO AND STILL WORE. SO, WHEN THE HOLIDAYS ROLLED AROUND, I CAME TO MY FAVORITE AND MOST CONVENIENT PLACE TO SHOP ---AMAZON-- AND THERE THEY WERE. HE WAS THRILLED AND SO WAS I. THE OLDER YOUR KIDS GET, THE HARDER IT IS TO SURPRISE THEM WITH SOMETHING THEY TRULY WANT---THAT DOESN'T BRAKE THE BANK!!!"
79993,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
122903,1,These feel fine on. They are well padded on the sides could use more on the bottoms though!Nice looking shoe But...Shapeups by Skechers are truely the way to go!
28978,1,"Not bad... took out of the box and started wearing right away. Comfortable, keeps the shine awhile."
261123,1,"I have been looking for a year for lowtop converse in red for my daughter. On the rare occasion that I found a pair, it was not the size I needed.I had no trouble locating them through Amazon. They arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and my daughter is thrilled. It was exactly what she wanted."
55965,1,"I received a different color from what I ordered, but I like them. Can't go wrong with Keds!"
157939,1,"Converse All-Stars are the all-American shoe, and the black monochrome goes with everything. Seriously; I've worn these to the opera."
321919,1,"I cant believe how easy it is to purchase these shoes without driving all over the place. They fit great, look great and saved me time."
149295,1,"i have 3 pairs i will be getting more.navy,black,red and the boots they are flat but put inasoles inside and enjoy"
311432,1,Great boots with ankle support. I have worn these boots hiking and they are great. I'm a big guy and they are perfect in the width as well
233026,1,"Minnetonka Moccasins are my favorite shoes. I buy the plain tan ones. For me, they can be worn with everything.

136373,1,"the chucks, of course their cool, comfy and fun. I love the color, haven't seen anyone else walking the street with these yet! My only complaint is that they are a little to big. I usually wear a size 8 and would be pushing it to be in a 7.5. I want these for comfort so I ordered an 8. Too long. Looks a little goofy. Order a size smaller than you usually would or they will likely be too long."
217000,1,"After wearing the high tops for basketball, I wanted a pair of the low tops that I could wear in the summer with shorts without looking like a complete idiot. These are possibly my favorite shoes (bearing in mind, I'm a guy). They're comfortable, and since they're made of canvas, my feet don't get hot while wearing them. I haven't had a problem with them getting cold either. I'd say the biggest plus over the high tops is the ease in which I'm able to put them on. You dont have to unlace half the shoe to be able to put your foot in it. The only disappointment I have is that the shoes aren't any less expensive on amazon as they are in retailers around my area."
357708,0,I purchased these to supplement some others I had my students wearing. I have had to repair the buckles every time hey have been worn.
45401,1,These were comfortable right out of the box. I had dress shoes and casual shoes and I needed a nice in between. These fit that perfectly. Still not convinced? The most interesting man in the world wears these.
210738,1,"I had been searching for over 2 months for these exact same shoes and finally found them here. Great product, no delivery problems at all."
281740,0,"These are great shoes, versatile, comfortable and classic. But...they are very short and I had to return the first pair and order a second in a half size larger."
368333,0,The picture showing the sandals I got had two pair together. No other pic showed two pairs. So I thought you got two for the price of one to clearance the colors. The color choices were bland. I was sent one pair only. Plain brown. Boring. I wrote to Altrec and they apologized and said one was what I get. I decided to keep them as I didn't want to pay shipping to return them. I also don't have time to mess around on sandals. I still think the picture was misleading and false advertising. I will question your sales due to this. If you want to send me another pair to honor the representation I will be impressed. If you read this response and write me an explanation I will be impressed. As a single working mom I need things I buy to be a good value. I was disappointed on this sale. Thank you for asking. Sue
321828,1,"I'm on the lookout for a casual old-fashioned tennis shoe/sneaker type shoe. Because I have plantar fasciitis I need a little heel height. This shoe looked like a great solution, and it is--nice padding inside, comfy, and the wedge gave me the heel height I needed. Unfortunately, though, it pinched my big toe and felt too short. So, back it went and I'm still looking."
358617,1,Great pair of shoes which I find very useful and wear them all the time.They even look great when worn with a suit which makes the hassle of dressing up a lot less of a task
74748,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
140644,1,"I have had two pair of these for 2 years now, and I love them. They are really the only flip flop I want to wear. I have the black on black and brown on brown, so they go with everything. They are a little dressier than the standard flip flop because of the cute straps, and people are always commenting on them. They stay looking great too. They are so cushiony. Extremely comfortable especially if you are going to be doing a lot of walking and they stay on well."
44414,1,"These shoes are an excellent buy. Our son has trouble finding quality shoes to fit, and these wear very well. They are definitely worth the money. My objection is that they were shipped by a carrier who is cosistently slow. It tood five days to get them.Not a huge difference, but the carrier changed the delivery date to accommodate the shoes just not moving for a couple of days during transit. But I would buy the shoes again and hope that Amazon would use UPS, which is consistently honors Amazon's estimated delivery dates."
184629,1,"I bought these for my son. He wears them all the time, he probably would luv to wear them to bed even, but..."
185622,1,"Just received them, delivered on time and they fit perfectly out of the box! I can't wait to try them out while shopping and especially the wash and wear part! These will be a great addition to my travel shoes!"
197166,1,"Great boots,fit great the second time around,which was my bad the first time,ordered them to narrow,very stylish,had alot of compliments on the style"
341387,1,I have a right drop foot and I wear a AFO brace which goes in side the shoe and I have now found the right size to wear this brace and these are very very comfortable. I will always buy from you. Thank You!!
318224,1,These shoes are great. I bought my first pair in green and liked them so much that I bought another pair in red.
133327,0,"The ballet slipper quality appears to be fine. However, they do run small. I read the reviews and thought they would be big or normal sizing but I found them to be small."
215208,1,"Several years ago I had problems running to include back pain and shin splints and was limited to running 2 or 3 miles at a time. I absolutely hated running, and I attribute this to ill-fitting shoes. After lots of searching for a new pair of shoes, I was recommended a pair of New Balance shoes...can't remember the exact model, but it was a predecessor to the 856. Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring. Good to see they're still available."
255668,1,This is a perfect shoe for all-round cheerleading. I love it! :)
155463,1,Good quality product. it does fit very well on the size you choose and are confortable.
255903,1,"Super comfortable, easy to walk. My mom wears it around the house like slippers and she loves it. I'm glad I got it for her, it's very important that her shoes are comfortable."
86634,1,These shoes are the best things I Bought on amazon. I recomeend this product who wants the real converse. I love them and now i wear them everyday and everywhere i go!!! I cant wait till i buy or get my next pair!!
259639,1,"These are great shoes and I get compliments everytime I wear them. The color is tough to match, so I usually go with something neutral."
30548,1,On time and perfectly packaged. Not like others....Ebay that just sends it in a paper wrap! I have nothing else to say thank you.
357760,1,"These are really nice shoes. They are holding up wonderfully. As the other reviewer shared, I, too, found them a little difficult to break in; however, well worth the price for durability."
126774,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
301771,0,"I have been wearing these sandals for the last 10 years, and have just bought another pair. Unfortunately the back strap that goes around the back of your ankle is now shorter than the back of the heel of shoe making your foot jut forward and hang over the edge of the sandal. I will now have to wear them in at home for some time until the leather strap at the back is long enough to allow my foot to sit in the sandal properly. Rather disappointing that the manufacturer has made a mistake."
241549,1,I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted. They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
225919,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
111353,1,"These are the greatest boots ever! (Particularly for the darkly inclined!) They are so comfortable you can stand or walk in them all day, and they make short little me feel so tall! They get lots of attention - usually either looks of pure envy, or looks of pure disgust, depending on the open or closed-mindedness of the beholder. Countless people have stopped me in stores or on the street to ask me where I got them, and I'm only too happy to tell them just how easily they can be obtained!"
79101,1,"These things are timeless. Their image is undeniable. My only complaint is that they are kind of thin and flat; if you're looking for cushy comfort shoes, they aren't for you."
14447,2,PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
131197,1,"I've been wearing Clarks Natureveldt shoes for at least 7 years now and have gone through about 4 pairs during that time.Previous pairs had been made in Europe, however, the two pairs (one black and one brown leather) that I recently purchased were made in China. So far, the fit is the same between the Chinese manufactured shoes and the European made ones. There are however some design differences, of which the tongue is the most apparent as it appears to be made a little bit cheaper than previously. The laces also appear to be a bit cheaper.Should note though that overall the design/build of the shoe appears to be about the same or better in most areas. Time will tell however, as these shoes are pretty much legendary for lasting a long time.The main thing that I've always liked about these shoes is how comfortable they are even from the first wear. They do not require any break-in whatsoever due to the type of leather used, how they are constructed and how they fit on your foot.They just feel good on my feet. They are also pretty comfortable to walk in and since I have flat feet, this is a must have in a shoe for me.I personally like the style of the shoe, although some might find them to be a bit too classic, laid back or casual for a leather shoe.All in all, these are the only leather shoes that I really feel good about buying these days, however that might change if the move to China significantly decreases the useful life of the shoe."
93119,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
216523,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
135629,1,"Before I got these slippers, I had a spot on my heel that felt like a corn. After wearing the slippers, which padded the sore spot, I no longer have it and can walk long distances in my outdoor shoes without difficulty."
248853,1,I couldnt of been happier. I purchased these shoes 5 years ago and they have lasted me all this time. I wish that I could find another pair
203560,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
198824,1,"I have been wearing this make of Converse for about 5 years now, it's just the type of shoe I like to wear. Since I've been wearing these shoes for so long I found it easier and more convinent to just by them online. But I do not purchase shoes online regularly. I was a little apprehensive purchasing them online only for fear that I might end up with a different style then what I am use to. Fourtunately the picture represents exactly what you are ordering,in addition to the description. I received my order a little later than I would've liked (i think it was on the 5th day which is nothing major). The size, and style were correct,the shoes even came laced up which allowed me to just slip them right on and throw the old ones out which I appreciated. Ummm...they feel like all the other pairs I have owned, and since this review focuses more on the seller I dont have any complaints about comfort or support because I knew what I was buying. So in summary the seller was good, my order was accurate in size and style, and my Chuck Taylor's have been replaced yet again!"
209788,1,Bought these for my boyfriend for Xmas as his first cowboy boots. Style is discreet and he loves them so much they may never actually see a horse...
220507,1,I love these boots they are perfect for my six year old. They are durable and I love the darker color so the dirt does not show as much. The price was great and shipping was fast
8608,1,"Cheap shoes, doesnt look cheap at all, fun snickers well made, confortable. Wont regreat if you decide buying this pair. Good look"
70515,1,"For quick moving feet and an improved jump shot pick up the dunk-feast a3 adidas b-bal shoe, you will not find a better fit. Great support for lower ankles and arches. Over all great shoe"
82456,0,Well they're Justin's so that says alot however I wanted a hard toe boot and that's what I ordered but that's not what I received.
259466,1,I got these for my son's 14th birthday. He was so excited he threw them on on the spot. He has worn them about a month now and they are still his favorites.
95912,1,"These are probably my eighth or ninth pair of Enzo Liberty Loafers. I have had them in many colors over the years; they wear well. I do have to replace my basic colors occasionally and these are replacing my old black ones. Thsey are comfortable from the first wearing forward, are a flattering fit and look good with casual and work clothes. When they are on sale, they are an unbeatable value."
347820,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
349380,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
113987,1,"these are a great classic shoe. not a ton of support but thats what i expected.when i opened the box i thought amazon had sent me the wrong color. i was expecting something more grey/khaki but got something that was more like army green. i guess i read khaki green in the description and overlooked the green part, ha. nevertheless i am enjoying these shoes. styyyyyyyyyyyylish."
278583,2,"The GOOD: I bought a pair of Hi-Tec many years ago. Paid around $85 for them. I loved them. They were the most comfortable boot, and I liked the way they laced up. Because of some of life's circumstances I was not able to use them very much until recently. As I am getting older I try to keep active and try to walk every day, but mostly on pavement rather than hiking trails.The BAD: Several months ago I got out my Hi-Tec boots, which still looked like new, and enjoyed using them again. Several days later I put them on again and about a quarter mile from home I heard a slapping and thought I had something stuck to my boot. When I checked, I realized the sole had come loose, and that what was flapping. I turned around and started back, thinking that I could take them to a shoe repair and have it re-attached, but when I got home and looked at them found that the sole was actually crumbling. Then I noticed the other shoe was also starting to come apart. Unfixable.The UGLY: I found the Hi-Tec company net site and sent an email explaining all this along with pictures of the crumbling soles hoping they would respond and at least give me a break on a new pair, but apparently they have chosen to ignore the problem."
321430,1,The shoes seem to be a good quality. They have nice coloring & very supple. I would recommend these shoes for anyone needing ballet shoes.
57907,1,I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide. I'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair.
304607,1,this is my first pair of sambas. they are great. just got them actually. they weren't supposed to arrive until tomorrow so i am thrilled. they fit perfectly too. great shoes and great fast service!
7913,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
162258,1,"you know the shoe and you know the star. the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now. I have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style. real nice, real nice."
218249,0,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
5336,1,I ordered these and when I got them they were everything I thought they would be. I love em!
169472,1,"I've been wearing Converse All Stars since the early sixties. The Jack Purcell is the same sneaker minus some stripes. I don't understand the gripe about ""feet burning""? I have ""medium"" feet? Normal feet? I don't have flat feet nor do I have high arches. Just regular feet. Converse sneakers are THE most popular sneakers in the world. Don't lace them so tight, wear crew socks and stop jumping out of trees and off roof tops and you'll be fine. They are a casual wear sneaker, not an athletic sneaker. Relax. Be casual.One point, they are canvas not leather. I knew that before I bought them. Amazon should edit the description."
71916,1,"This is an awesome bag that's well constructed and looks like it costs much more than it did. I use it almost daily during fall and winter and it shows absolutely no wear. The leather is heavy and a rich color and texture, too. It has lots of room for all your things, especially if you work long hours or go from work to evening often.It is a substantial bag so if you are petite, it may be a bit overwhelming for a small frame."
23552,1,Best ever!I'm 280lbs and these support me very wellThey last for months and months of hard useBottle opener on each soleGreat quality flip flopsWell worth the priceThis is my 5th pair in 5 yrsI wear them nearly year round
363592,0,"This sandal is nice looking. My boyfriend wore it for a week, then it split in half. There was a 30 day guarantee on it, so we received a second pair. So far so good, but we'll cross our fingers. Customer service was great with the vendor. Maybe it was just a fluke! We'll see!"
176895,1,I liked these very much. My son said they were very comfortable not like weejuns from bass that are so hard to break in. also rubber sole helped with not being slick on bottom.
290412,1,"The best shoe around if you are looking for good arch support. They are light weight so walking is effortless. Try them, you'll like them."
41190,1,this pair of reefs is very comfy..the soles are padded and comfy enough to walk for hours. they are just as described...size is also perfect.
62844,0,I had these same sneakers in the past and same size etc and they fit well. These hurt my feet after a little while so I haven't worn them in a while. I know I cant return them as I wore them for an hour out in the yard so they are a little dirty. I just think they aren't made the same as they were about 10 years ago.
88918,1,"Good quality Cedar wood, I love the smell. It keeps my shoes smelling good. Great for breaking in a new pair ofGiorgio Brutini Men's Gloss Kid Slip On 15904 Slip-on Shoes. And that is exactly what I brought for them."
191401,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
65948,0,"I bought these thinking that they were like the ADIDAS Superstar, which in my opinion is superior to the Samoa, which I know is a very popular shoe.The outside of the shoe seems thin and flimsy, compared to the thicker leather of the Superstar.I am sure that this is a very fine shoe, but for my money, I prefer the style and quality of the ADIDAS Superstar."
51592,1,"Right out of the box, these are the most comfortable walkers I've ever had. I have arthritis in my knees and these shoes help to stabilize my stride so I can walk farther without pain. I will definitely buy more of these so I can have a pair in each color."
205824,1,This shoe is very comfortable and so far easy to clean. They were comfortable at the first wearing. They are excellent when you have a lot of walking to do.
225851,1,I love them in every color!! :) The shoes are simple and perfect! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so! I highly recommend these!
153306,1,"I wear this shoe nearly all of the time and love it! Never a problem, always comfortable, and love the different colors. This is the best style of Easy Spirit for my feet, other styles being too tight for my high arch. I stick with only this style."
255940,1,Bought these for my mom who has foot problems and she loves them. Raved about how comfortable they are.
197932,1,"I haven't worn converse for years! I forgot how wonderful they felt and how much fun it is to wear them. I'm a stay at home mom and want to get ""dressed to shoes"" every morning in some lace up shoes. I don't really like the look of white athletic type shoes unless I'm exercising. I love my new converse shoes!"
287332,1,Great product. Have worn these for years and they never disappoint me. Comfortable and good fit. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.
168897,1,"Brand new item, just as defined and packing the best and would buy from again anytime. Thanks!"
362395,1,I got these shoes for my boyfriend. He LOVED them. They're super comfy (I tested them out). Overall...great shoes
39208,1,"I have been a huge fan of Danner boots since I was issued my first pair of Matterhorns in 1997 in the Army. I have always referred to Danner as the Cadillac of boots.A couple of years ago, I bought a pair of Danner Light II's and a pair of Danner Patrol boots. I wear these boots to work daily.I cannot recommend these boots enough. The Danner boot has a wide platform, stiff sole, and terribly comfortable upper. After a couple of months, these boots will feel like they were custom made for your feet.These boots are not cheap, but with footwear, you get what you pay for."
370693,1,"The product was handled professionally by the supplier and the supplier rendered all assistance that was needed and the product was delivered on time. Good product, good job by supplier"
56326,1,Love the sneaker and it fits well and worth the money. It is comfortable and great for the summer when you are out walking for leasure.
33775,1,"Zapatos de linea cl&aacute;sica, deportivos, ideales para el d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a, de extrema calidad. Super r&aacute;pido el envio al casillero en Miami. Compra desde Venezuela"
214177,1,The picture shows the hook and loop opening on both sides... it is only on one side. I had seen someone else's complaint about the same thing but the naive me thought that it was fixed!! NOPE.. still showing the wrong pix!!! Other than that I had a great experience. Arrived on time and they look like a sturdy boot that is comparable to Uggs without the high price. We will see how they last after Christmas!!
222405,1,"I love these slippers. I had returned the Uggs Coquette for these because the Uggs shearling mats down so quickly and soon you are standing on a hard, inflexible sole. I don't know how long it will take for the shearling on these slippers to mat down, but so far, these are more of a slipper than shoe and that is what I am looking for. I don't wear them outdoors, so padding quietly about the house is perfect in these soft moccasins."
339266,1,"Exactly as was expected, good very durable shoes. Very clean and wearable. Would definitely purchase again, nice to wear out."
172738,1,"If your looking for new pair of ""fresh whites"" this is a great shoe. I was skeptical from the picture, but once I got them I was defenitly satisfied. Comfortable and look good, I dont really run in them, so I couldnt tell you about performance."
92431,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
237303,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
380240,0,"The shoe itself is sturdy, well designed and well made; however, the width is actually one width less. For example, a Wide is actually only a C and not really a D."
162404,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
270306,1,"I've always heard Rockport made comfortable shoes, and I can now confirm this is a fact. No break-in period required with these shoes, if you walk a lot during the course of your day, this is the pair of shoes for you.RD"
167330,1,"Such a comfortable shoe!I usually buy cheaper shoes, and while they are a deal, my feet pay the price. Slipping my Easy Spirit shoes on is like a vacation for my feet!"
128173,0,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
322677,1,I purchased the Tommy Hilfiger Distressed Bobbie Slip-On quite a while back. I love these shoes. I even purchased a second pair in a different color. These make the perfect slip-on for summer days and during the spring. I like to use mine when I haven't had a chance to get a pedicure. This helps to hide the toes. I've gotten lots of compliments on these shoes in both colors. I think the distressed look makes them even more interesting and adds to what you can wear them with. They go great with shorts or capris.
277080,1,"Got these for my wife and I. Both are happy with this purchase. As said by most reviewers... look funky but are comfortable. Certainly not wearing them to work but by the pool and at the beach, can't beat 'em. Amazon seemed to have the best prices I could find as well. Prices change often. If you are looking for a deal just check the site daily."
326768,1,I love these flip flops! They're soft and have great arch support. I want more in other colors!
147627,1,"I spent several days researching the right pair of boots. I narrowed it down to UGGs which had very positive reviews but were pricey, and EMUs which seemed to be basically the same product for half the price. Sounds too good to be true? It is.Here is what I found:- UGGs are made of sheepskin inside and out, and cost $130-$160 forthe most popular type (called Classic, short or tall), more for the""fancier"" varieties (but I honestly prefer the look of the Classicmodel)- EMUs have TWO types of products: (1) sheepskin inside and out, and(2) cowhide outside, merino wool inside. The first variety cost thesame as the UGGs, the second one (not as cozy, not as comfi) costabout half the priceSo, I went with the UGGs which appear to be the more original/popular and am VERY VERY happy - these boots really insulate you from the harsh cold completely. Happy feet are worth the $$ for me in thise case. I got the tall variety in grey, and LOVE LOVE LOVE them.Another misconception that I'd like to correct - NEITHER is 100% waterproof - as in they'll basically keep you warm and dry in a reasonable amount of rain/snow, but if you drench them it will show (common sense). UGGs has real waterproof models which are more like regular snow boots etc. UGGs also has a water-resistant treatment to improve the durability, but friends I spoke to didn't do that and haven't had any water seeping in when she's worn UGGs in the rain.So basically, the real deal sheepskin product costs the same (and is similar in quality, comfort).I had such a hard time figuring this out - shame on all the websites for sneakily pretending that the cheaper EMUs are made of the same material, which they are not!"
242560,1,"These shoes are what I was looking for..but, they do run a little big. So be sure to get a size down from your regular size. I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe..They are comfortable and you cant beat the price..shipping was pretty face as well."
323349,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
182539,1,"As a nurse I have to say I love these shoes! Bought them after an EXTREAMLY expensive pair of shoes came in contact with a code brown! These shoes have no cloth parts to worry about-- Loves the patient but didnt want to carry her code brown around with me in the fine mesh on my shoes! -- Also the treads are amazing-- no need for a knife-- toothpick etc to remove... dirt? just wipe them off-- they are really really comfy, convienient and best of all easy to clean. I have found the shoe for the rest of my nursing career here!"
149314,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
144063,1,"My first pair of Uggs were the Bailey Buttons. I had no idea what I was getting myself involved in. Once I stuck my feet inside of them, I was thrilled and hooked to find how soft it was in the inside. I bought these because I wanted some more kind and also I wanted to feel that softness again and have a choice of which pair I wanted to wear. I LOVE THESE BOOTS! It's too bad they aren't rainyproof (made up word) because I would wear them all the time. I feel like I'm walking on clouds!!! They are my favorite shoes and I prefer to wear them over my house slippers."
246989,1,The only shoes my husband will wear! It's perfect for his feet. He's 67 years young and has bad arches. He absolutely will wear nothing else!
120306,1,"I am going on my 4th pair of these and they are so fantastic. Super comfy. The only last me one season, because I wear them pretty much every day for about 4 months. It's worth it to me to keep buying them though, because they are the only flip flops that don't hurt my feet or leave blisters. Get these!"
72672,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
215141,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
851,1,"great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
101549,1,I love this shoe on my daughter's foot. It compliments her foot and is very comfortable.
56770,1,I love anything denim. these sneakers are great with jeans. They feel a little big but not unwearable. thanks
117061,1,I work a very physical retail/grocery job and these shoes are great - I have had 3 pairs now. Only flaw would be the inside wears through the fabric at the back of the heel after a few months.
240646,1,"Nice Foot Clothes for the average joe could find nice to wear in the rain, sun, snow, wind and sand."
377443,1,Gave these to my husband for Christmas. He loves them!! I would venture to say that these are probably the best slippers he's ever had. He's worn the every day since and loves the fact that he can take the dog out in them. He normally wears a 9.5 but I got him a 10 & they fit perfectly! So comfy!!!
92198,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
45413,1,These shoes replace the same shoes that lasted for several years but finally wore out. I expect these shoes to give good service for a similar long time.
107982,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
107108,1,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
191018,1,I was recently on a cruise and saw these shoes on a woman...I immediately fell in love with the look and I generally love Sketchers (I have 3 other pairs)...I received them today and they look and feel great...the only downside is that they are very difficult to put on. Hopefully they will stretch a little.
193613,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
74080,2,"Nice looking shoes, but the ones I received are way too small. They say size 7.5N, but definitely are not. I will have to return them."
270703,1,I really like these slippers. Warm and comfortable and the no skid bottoms really are much appreciated. They are warm enough to not need socks. Easy on and off. Good product.
132207,1,"This was perfect for the 3 year old's first ballet class. She looked like a perfect little ballerina. Only problem, as with most shoes with ties for kids that age is that come undone easily."
219278,1,"OUTSTANDING! it's a happy day when my mom can actually find a shoe to fit her comfortably and at such a low price. She loves the color and comfort. Fast, excellent shipping."
138489,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
136209,1,My granddaughter asked for these at Christmas. She thinks they are awesome and can't wait to wear them to school in the new year.
345985,1,"Converse All Stars, a classic. Love them. They're very comfortable and they're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys.Obviously they do not have much support or cushion (and I wasn't expecting any). If I was going to be on my feet all day or doing something real active this is not the shoe I would choose.Tilly's service was fantastic. I couldn't be more pleased."
152263,1,"These shoes are stylish, comfortable and functional. They can be worn for anything and look great spring, summer or fall. Amazon made the purchase easy and shipped fast!"
314167,1,"I received these shoes promptly, but sadly to say too wide for me. I wear a narrow and I ordered a narrow, but I really needed a slim, which they were out of. So this style of narrow runs wide. But this shoe is of great quality and the cream color is perfect. You can't go wrong with this shoe as far as the quality,..and the price is ridiculous. If you have very narrow feet, this shoe is probably not a wise choice for you as it wasn't for me. I rated it 4 b/c it's a little wide for a narrow. Good luck."
226146,1,"buenos zapatos, excelente producto y llego a tiempo, por lo tanto lo recomiendo cien por ciento. saludos a todos ( a b c d )"
108612,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
363441,1,I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted. They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
326893,1,I have this shoe in a light blue color and I really like them. They are very comfortable and I wear them all the time. They are pretty true to size.
381765,0,"These shoes look great, but as far as comfort...I can only give them a three-star rating. They absolutely provide NO arch support. However, they are wide enough for my very wide feet."
341616,1,"This is probably the most comfortable shoe out there. These Easy Spirit mules are very lightweight and have a super-cushioned sole and soft insides. I'm buying several more pair in different colors. I found the best price through Amazon and after placing the on-line order, received the shoes in about a week. Very efficient service."
62821,1,I'm very happy with this purchase. I love my new navy Keds! They came quickly and fit great!
314428,1,I bought the wheat and the black Nellie ankle boots. I have big ankles and they fit comfortably the very first time I put them on.I didn't have to wear them two or three times to break them in.
124574,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
238977,0,"I got these recently as a Todays Deal special. I did not have time to read all the reviews and ordered true to size assuming they run a little big like Uggs. The recipient (gift) really liked them but unfortunately they were small. Yes he did try them on without socks for those who thinks that make a difference, since he intends to use them as slippers.The boots look nice and comfortable so I gave them 3 stars but I wish the manufacturer or Amazon advised people about how they run so they could order properly. Since the price has more than doubled since I ordered I will just send them back, but I would consider re-ordering in a bigger size if I catch them on sale again."
179893,1,I'm a huge sneaker freak and have to say these shoes are some of my favorites. Comfortable and stylish they look great with my 511 skinny leg jeans. I will always keep a pair of these in my collection.
359943,1,"I ordered these shoes for a high school student to wear during a production. After reading the reviews, we decided to order them one full size larger that the normal shoe size. This was definitely the way to go. After hours of use there were no blisters or pain. I recommend going the full size larger."
347375,1,"Converse All Stars, a classic. Love them. They're very comfortable and they're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys.Obviously they do not have much support or cushion (and I wasn't expecting any).

58524,1,"These shoes are exactly what I wanted! I needed a comfortable, light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase. Super fast shipping, and a beautiful product."
225551,1,Basically just got what I ordered. Thanks for the deal! The size and shoe were both correct and they were brand new.
55808,1,I purchased these for my daughter. We actually had a hard time finding these in any store where we live. Delivery was timely and item was as described.
313323,1,"buy this one for my girl friend, she like it, feel comfortable whe she wear it. Seem nice as well, maybe i need one for myself."
54633,0,I recently had foot surgery and was looking for a nice wide plain sneaker. These are really cute but not wide enough. I would order the widest they offer. I will be giving these away and ordering the wider one. I really like them
279245,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
269133,1,"I have owned Prowalkers for years. This the 5th or 6th pair. They are solid, comfortable, and wear well and are reasonable."
170122,1,"i was soo happy to find my shoes in the style, color and size i wanted. I looked everywhere and this was the ONLY store that had them.Thanks again!!!"
362833,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
361753,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
44012,0,They are hard to get on my son even though there is plenty of room in the shoe once his foot is in. I won't buy this style again. But they are good quality and were really cute once we had them on.
141488,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
140494,0,Very cute and comfortable but sweating in them seems to draw out the dye from the sole and causes my feet to blacken. Will try soaking sandals in soapy water to dilute dye.
338101,1,"Since Nike bought Converse the have altered the shoe. There used to be an extra piece of stitched canvas on the inner part just below the big toe and stitching through the back heal of the canvas. The show is basically the same, except without this extra stitching and canvas they do not last as long."
48016,1,"These are the greatest sandals I have ever bought. They are comfortable, lightweight, and durable. Everything you might ever need."
85391,1,Great for the person that is on their feet for long hours. They may not be as nice as the Hi-Tec Magnum boots but they are close and about half the price. The best way to break them in is still to get them wet and wear them all day while hiking or just walking. By the end of the day the boots will be fitted to you feet and broken in to perfection. You may find youself wearing them more often then you thought you would.
280556,1,I have a pair of North Face pack boots that I purchased last year and they weren't very breathable so I decided to get the trusted Sorels and I couldn't be more pleased. They are even better than the pair I had in high school. if you need cold weather boots with good traction get these!
25322,2,Ordered 2 for my sister and wife. Sizes are 1 full size smaller than US standard. Has to exchange the item. Be careful...Thanks/.
167285,1,These shoes are true to size and very comfortable - no break-in was required. The color is a rich dark brown. They are a cross between a clog and a sneaker. I like being able to just slip into them.
164242,1,"I LOVE disco, and these shoes really do complement any outfit. I was afraid that they would be difficult to walk in but they really aren't! I also read the reviews that if you are a half size to just order the next size up (since there are no half sizes for this shoe) but I ordered a 6, I am a 6 1/2 and it fits snugly (which is how the shoe is supposed to be). Great product, I will probably be buying another one of these in pink soon!"
191244,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
359811,1,This shoe fit true to size; i.e. regular street shoe size. Medium width. I have been dancing in them a few weeks now and they were easy to break in. I prefer to have snaps instead of a buckle so that costume changes are easier but the shoe seems to be well made over all.
165621,0,"The color did not go with the outfits & the fit was not narrow enough. I really wanted just the camel color without the croc look, made the shoes look cheap. Sent them back, will try again. The seller was excellent, will buy from again."
123840,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
218157,1,I loved these shoes when I got them. They Rock. The company Dress Code is great also they were really good to me when I received my shoes unfortunately they didn't fit so I had to return them for a pair one size bigger. Anyway I didn't have the money at that time to send them back right away so I told them I would send them back as soon as I got paid and to my surprise a few days later I received a prepaid return label from them it was great. Now I am able to send them back right away I am very happy with everything.
177009,0,"Oh, how I wish these were evenly constructed and a little wider, because they are a nice shoe, and the price is reasonable. I had the same problem as the previous reviewer, except the right shoe is the one that was uneven. It looked a little ""wonky"" upon taking the pair out of the box; but, I thought it was the way they were packaged and/or my eyes playing tricks on me. However, I could tell *immediately* when trying them on that the right shoe was not ""right"".Also, I normally wear a medium-width shoe, and even though these are marked as such, they are a little narrow (even with thin, ""dress"" socks)."
7799,0,"The Keds sneaker is a classic, same style as always, and worn by everyone. I was surprised, however, that they tend to run a little small! My foot is between 9.5 and 10 in size, so I bought 10, and I can't wear them with socks. I am trying to stretch them with shoe trees in hopes of being able to wear them more often. I have to say, that's a little disappointing."
250471,0,"I purchased a pair of these after reading reviews praising their arch support, but had to return them. They were the correct size, but too narrow to accommodate my orthotics. If you don't need custom arch supports, these shoes would probably offer decent support for high, weak arches."
112877,1,"They are a good fit, size and width were true. They are good looking shoes and lightweight. However, some of the seams are a little sharp and dig into my ankles, have to wear thick socks! I think that this may be improving as they break in."
194234,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
265070,1,"These boots not just look good but are very comfortable, this is my third pair .......I would recommend these to any one who is looking for a low price hiking boot"
295834,1,"I do park hiking, up hills and steps. These are fantastic. I never slipped once, even on ice. I'm so glad I bought these."
113578,1,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They are good quality and fit great.
232049,1,"ESTE ES MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO"
315485,0,"I bought this shoes, are really nice and fit well done. At six months the sole of the left shoe damaged without apparent reason. Nice shoes but expensives, I could pay at least US$40.00."
375812,1,"This is my 2nd pair of Propet walkers. I have the other pair that has mesh instead of solid leather, which are good for summer time but not winter when it's wet outside. I wanted a leather pair to keep the moisture out of my shoes when I'm outside & I do walk a lot so a good walking shoe is a must.I'm type 2 diabetic & was having some ingrown toe nail problems. After buying my 1st pair of these shoes, within 3 months I was able to get rid of the ingrown toe nail. The shoes have more toe room & are stable to keep my foot from rolling out when I walk. I was having lots of back pain, and if I don't get a good shoe like i said my foot rolls out & my ankles start to hurt.With these shoes I have no pain, am steady on my feet & the rubber sole is good to keep me from sliding around on wet floors: an added plus.I wanted to mention that these shoes are comfortable, they have a snug fit feel to them, but not so tight that your feet feel crammed. Earlier I was wearing these shoes because my feet were so swollen I couldn't get anything else on except slippers. These went right on, did not make my feet feel crammed, & with the heel pain I was having from the swelling i couldn't feel it.These are really some nice shoes, they are light weight & feel good after being on my feet all day walking around, even when I take the dog for a walk.I've cleaned out my closet of all the other favorite shoes I had, and only have these 2 pairs now. Nothing else can compare to how these feel for me & how well they keep my feet healthy."
151381,1,"I have run for years in the 990's. It was time to switch to a shoe that would fit an &#34;everyday&#34; lifestyle. I was first fitted @ a NewBalance store (which I HIGHLY recommend). They determined that I had a wider foot (aka. &#34;D&#34;) and also noted that instead of me buying my regular 10.5...I would be better suited for an 11.So I purchased an 11D. I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised with a great fit and comfort that rivals the 990's. If you need to take a break from a running shoe...these are a must for people with wider feet and need room in the front.Also, Amazon handled the delivery with high marks (under 2 days)! Well done NB, Amazon, and the NB shoe store!"
207517,1,"I have to say I bought these to go with my halloween costume. But I really like them! I wore them around the house while cooking to get use to them. All of you who spend a half an hour in the kitchen cooking know that the last thing you want to be wearing are heals, but my feet were fine. Definately not sneakers, but not horrible pain either that comes with normal heals. I also love the height they give me! I'm only 5'2"", so 4 inches is a big deal! They are pretty much what you see in the picture. The straps are soft and comfortable. The material for the straps are sewn together to form a tube, so there is a lot of material to them, which adds to the comfort. I have no idea what I would wear these with, but I'll have to come up with something because they are to great to only wear once!"
148739,2,The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so. The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality.
60540,1,My husband has loved these boots for years and I was happy to find them still available - he enjoyed receiving 2 pairs for Christmas.
83538,1,"So far they seem really comfy like everyone says, but they run very small. I knew this and order a half size larger. Still too small. Now I have to deal with an Marketplace seller return. Stock these yourself Amazon!"
118510,1,"I ordered a few of these bags and was so glad I did! I kept one for myself and gave two as gifts. They are very durable, sturdy and huge! I had them embroidered and they made great gifts!"
373319,1,"This is the 2nd time I am ordering these shoes. The first pair I ordered years ago and they lasted all this time with much use but are finally falling a bit apart. I was surprised and pleased to see that they are still being sold here. I really can't say enough about them - they look pretty and stylish and I've been complimented on them by people I know as well as strangers. For tall platforms/heels they are extremely comfortable - I've walked and walked and spent hours at a time in them with hardly an ache. The only minor issue as the other reviewer mentioned is the front is a bit wide so my feet slide in front but it's just a tiny thing that doesn't really bother me, if it does you they sell those shoe things that you put in the front to prevent your toes/front of your feet from going over the edge of the shoe."
239396,0,I have bought these sandals in a physical store before and they fit better. The ankle strap just didn't have enough velcro on it or it wore off quicker than expected.
72406,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
313362,0,"These boots look very nice. The problem with them is they are made really big. I bought the size my son wears in other shoes, but these boots turned out to be quite larger than he needed. They make his feet look huge."
97584,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
26675,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
180256,1,"Shipping was way fast, this is my 5th pair of Chucks the black on black is slick, they breath better than any other shoe ive ever owned and it definitely wont be my last pair."
101813,1,The size was right. Don't buy too big. 2.5 size are 2.5 size. Shoes themselves look good.Colour good like other shoes you see/
322770,1,Excellent leather slippers.From Amazon. Easy to wear and comfortable to dance in. You must try them. I gave them excellent reviews.
164961,1,"I bought these for my Bronco fanatic husband for XMas and he just loved them!!! They came faster than i expected, like 3 days or so and they were packaged perfectly........i will definitley buy again from Amazon!!!"
141502,2,"I am a 6'1"" female and ordered a size 12. The actual shoe part fit fine, however, I could have fit both legs into one boot. The sizing was utterly ridiculous. You will also be charged 20% restocking fees for any returned merchandise. Don't waste your time."
295142,1,The Yaktrax Walker Traction Clease for Snow and Ice have been a great help during this long snowy and icy winter.
137647,1,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
161502,1,"I like the retro style of these shoes, very well made and a decent price. I wish the tongue of the show was wider and did not slide around as much."
370828,1,"I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
305493,1,Have been wearing Rockport shoes for years since wearing a brace. No breaking them in. They are comfortable from day one and good value for the money when purchased from Amazon.
271238,1,"Excellent shoe, it`s perfect with almost all clothes... Fits exactly in my feet, and even though I do not use it for skateboarding, it might be an unique shoe to do so. And another thing, it`s Vans!! Needles to say more."
257426,1,"These pumps are fabulous. Cool, iridescent, sexy. Just awesome for a night out or even showing off at the office. I love them."
328936,1,Thank you! Quick service and just as described. Perfect fit!
114951,1,These shoes are great for work. They are comfortable (not too wide either so I'm not swimming in them) and look really nice to boot. Overall happy with my purchase.
193038,1,"Recd the shoe, both shoes and box were in immaculate condition. Colour and design was exactly what I could not find in stores. Clarks make real comfortable shoes."
189450,1,These were a Christmas Gift and the person who I bought these for loved them and were exactly what they wanted.
268091,1,Excellent shoe. Especially for nurses. Make sure to order a whole size larger than you normally wear.
222944,1,"Great boots, well made although mine are a little unequal with the cut of the leather. Unless one of my ankles is half an inch bigger than the other one. Possible I guess. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the little quick lace up doohickeys are a little problematic. They are meant to help you lace up the boots faster but they are very small and not as easy to use as the older design. Fortunately I was visiting my mom and had her put her finger on the strings so I could tie them up.:>"
100813,1,"My granddaughter loved the shoes. She is three and loves playing princess and dancer, so the shoes were a real hit."
194957,1,"Super stylish and comfortable. Great choice for traveling and going through TSA security checkpoints at the airport. Easy slip on and off. I own these in both black and brown. Love them, but unfortunately, I can only rate these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because I stand on my feet all day at work. I started a new job about a year ago which requires standing all day. These shoes were well broken in long before then. At the end of the first day in which I wore these to work, my feet were killing me. I will still wear them, but only for travel and during off time."
300227,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
171957,1,"Minnetonka Moccasins are my favorite shoes. I buy the plain tan ones. For me, they can be worn with everything. They are so soft, it is like walking bare foot, and the soles are slip proof! :)Minnetonka Women's Deerskin Gore Front Crepe Sole Moccasins,Mocha Deerskin,11 M USMinnetonka Women's Deerskin Gore Front Crepe Sole Moccasins,Mocha Deerskin,11 M US"
151260,1,"First impressions (I have owned them for a month now).Good looking sporty look. Seem about 1/2 size smaller than expected.Have worn them in heavy snow and 15-30F temperatures.Have NOT drawn any water - feet stayed dry the whole time.These boots ARE NOT insulated - after roughly 15 minutes in 20F my feet were very cold - I am not saying this is a ""fault"" since I know these are not heavy winter boots - I just want people to be aware.I bought the darker ""mud"" color from sierratrading... might also order these ""stinger""."
203744,1,"My Reefs lasted 7 years, traveled to 5 continents, and traversed at least 5,000 miles. After a while they were perfectly molded my feet. I backpacked for 3 months across Europe, walking sometimes 10 miles a day, and wore nothing but my Reefs. Not a single blister and completely comfortable.I also own Havaianas, Chocos, Birkenstocks, and Tevas but haven't been able to wear any of them for multiple days of extensive walking without blisters or with the same comfort level of my Reefs. Recently the tread finally wore down to credit card thin and they needed to be replaced. I was thrilled when I saw that they still sold this model. These are hands down the best sandals out there for comfort and use."
281285,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
146277,1,"I was so happy to be able to purchase Uggs boots on Amazon. The price was great, and the boots arrived quickly. They were so sharp that I wore them the day I received them with my new outfit."
30759,1,"Great value for the price. The boots served me well this winter. I coach and watch hockey and used them during snow blowing my driveway in a northern climate. They were warm enough. They needed some support though, so I bought some cheap inserts to make them comfortable enough to wear. You will need something to cushion your feet."
212960,1,"EXCELLENT PURCHASE IS REALLY A PRODUCT QUALITY, SAME AS PUBLISHED IN THE PHOTO AND GREAT PRICE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It was very good buy."
63888,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
298930,0,I did not think the bag was this small. should read description of item next time. I had to purchase another bag for my trip.
360936,0,"This slipper was very cute and stylish; however, I measure at a 10 1/2N. I ordered up and not only was it too long, it was also way too wide. My husbands slippers fit me better! I exchanged them for the 10N which fit much better; but I found to still be on the large side."
287224,0,Why buy here when you can get the first pair at a Rockport outlet for $10 or more less and then a second pair for half off that lower price??Need to be careful. These days Amazon does not always offer the best value!
26114,1,"I don't know how many pairs of this shoe I've owned over the years -- maybe around ten. I've run thousands of miles in them, but they're my walking shoes too, and if you need to stand for hours at a time they're great for that too. They're one of the few running shoes that come in different widths, and they offer the kind of support, stability, and cushioning podiatrists recommend for flat feet. I use prescription orthotics and wear them under the insoles. I've tried the more expensive 2001's with leather in place of suede, but the 991's seem to last longer and hold up better. They're made so well they never fall apart, instead they just slowly lose the cushioning and support. And a great extra is, instead of being made by Third World slave children, they're made right here in the USA."
278704,1,I have bought Hi-Tec Altitude shoes for a good 10 years and probably have purchased that many pair. Very comfortable to hike and work outside in. I have acreage and work for hours at a time thinning brush and the like and they always are comfortable.
89302,1,I got my product on time and the same quality i have been use to in the past.. Hopefully these will last 10 years too..
261767,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
256195,1,"I bought some white shoes similiar to these in the summer that were so comfortable. So, when I saw these, I didn't hesitate to purchase them. I got the black patent & they look pretty cute. I wear them with jeans or dress pants."
275021,1,"These are the best boots I have ever purchased, they are water proof and very comfortable... don't be afraid to buy these !"
101919,1,"I've yet to find a better boot for the money. Can't say I'm fond of the yellow stripes, but they don't look too bad. Steel toe is a welcome addition, plus they actually carry these in wide sizes (unlike the majority of shoes/boots on Amazon.)"
13443,1,I got the shoes well before the date they were expected. Can't ask for better service!
371490,0,"I bought this shoe without having tried it on (which could have been a mistake) and was lucky enough to find my feet fit. Because there are no laces and the tightening system isn't that great, it would be advised to go down a size for a tighter fit. One of the shoes at the seam rubs on my ankle causing discomfort, however this could simply be my ankle and may not affect others rather than a problem with the shoe itself. The shoes are somewhat heavy (don't expect to be able to jump any higher) and the leather is quite soft and wears easily. I give these shoes 3.5/5, loosing points due to their weight and discomfort they cause me (again may only be in my case), however they look great."
194660,1,"Love the style of this sandal. Not my first pair. Very comfortable, good fit in the size I need. The only problem I had was that the color was not what I thought I was ordering, but would like to have more colors in the same style."
309871,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
130162,1,A sneaker that you can wear to work. The opening falls lower on foot than expected. Fairly comfortable though.
299900,2,"The quality is good, but the cut of the shoe is much narrower in front than other Sebago boat models. I had to return these."
135323,1,excellent converse all star. the product was well described and satisfied my needs. the shipment has been quick
149255,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
12676,1,I have a pair of these and they are my go-to shoe. They are soooo confortable and they go with any kind of jean and never fail to make a statment. I have own my pair of all black chucks for over 7 years and wear them often and they are only now starting to show wear. They are tough and confortable. I will never hesitate to buy chucks. If you don't find anything you like go to the converse site and create your own. I LOVE the ones I created there.
189296,1,"This is the second time I have purchased this boot, and I would have to say ""Its a great deal, and a good work boot"". Even though these boots ""Can"" last up to a couple of years on the outside, I purchase a new pair ""Every year"" just because the inside comfort doesnt last that long. I use these boots for climbing poles and standing on ladders 30ft in the air. Only found two downfalls about these, 1. Moisture does seem to get to my socks and feet after a couple of months of wear. 2. You can feel the steel shank on the bottom of your foot when wearing the boots, wich make them a little uncomfortable. I will continue to buy unless I find a more comfortable boot for the same price."
233069,1,"Ariat Roper Boots are the most comfortable Cowboy boots I've used. They are well made and look authentic, plus they are durable. The rubber sole makes them the most practical Cowboy boot you can own. They are well suited for everything but dress occasions."
54133,1,"The brand ""Keds"" speaks for itself. But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days. Like the fact they come in different widths."
245459,0,....but my wife reports that it does not fil her foot very well. It is the smallest 5.5 shoe she has ever had....
313255,1,"Cannot complain about construction and quality of these shoes however, I ordered a B width but they were too wide for my comfort. Since I had saved a great deal of money on the purchase I gave them as a gift rather than return. The person was extremely pleased to receive such nice shoes."
305089,1,"Since Amazon's price point on these shoes is usually very good, I wanted to shop Amazon for this product that I have used for several years. However, the size wasn't right so I returned them.The product itself is excellent with built-in steel springs which makes for a lighter step, and the shoes are well built."
238926,1,I haven't bought much on amazon. Normally the things I like can't be shipped internationally to Australia. I had no problems with this purchase. It took about three weeks for them to get here. I expected this.These boots are fantastic. Have been using them on my Harley the last few weeks. Comfortable to ride in and they look great. I highly recommend them. I will note that it took me about a week to break them in. But that isn't too bad in my experience.
299188,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
71067,1,"These are awesome shoes. I am actually wearing them as everyday shoes, not for dance! They are the most comfortable shoes, especially for someone who is on her feet all day as a teacher! My collegues have given me compliments on them and are thinking of purchasing somethemselves. Well worth the money."
388915,1,"i HAVE PURCHASED ANNIE PEANUT BEFORE AND THEY ARE THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I OWN. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE DENIM IN MY SIZE FOR AGES AND I FOUND THEM ON AMAZON, I SITE I ALSO HAVE USED MANY TIMES BEFORE. THEY ARE BOTH GREAT."
28130,1,the shoes were great.. My daughter had all the girls askig where she got them.
326858,1,Great shoe. The big toes start to wear through the tops after awhile. Very temped though to stick with Asics and go with the next shoe or save some cash and buy the same model just a lot cheaper this time around since it's a late model.
316070,1,This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought. All different colors. They are great to wear in the office in the summer.
268224,1,"I bought these shoes for running a full marathon (my other shoes were getting old), and they are very comfortable even after 25 miles."
23607,0,"While my title says for you to try at store, i am not sure that wearing it for a few minutes will let you have a real feeling for this sandal.I got it a few weeks ago, and tried it for the first few times for at least a couple hours straight, just walking around in my town with my wife. I wasn't walking at a fast pace. After a couple hours i felt that it was hurting my feet, on top of my right foot. It is a beautiful sandal, but definitely not made to be at my feet for too long. Sad, i really wish i could take it would me on my trip to Europe in October."
32239,1,"This is my third pair. They are harder and harder to find. Very comfortable, easy to put on, just wish the tonge was sewn down, so it didn't more, but I do that and they are perfect!"
356995,1,These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price. I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe.
34592,1,"I have worn this style of Easy Spirit shoe for many years. I'm so thankful that it hasn't chaged. It's stylish, yet very comfortable and gives my feet excellent support. I thoroughly recommend it."
319628,1,14+ hours and no pain...must have....you will love them and they last 6-8 months if you wear them everyday...just bring the price down and will buy in bulk...
202418,0,The left show was not assembled evenly when compared to the right. Had to return them. Its a shame because they are the best boat shoes I was able to find.
44972,1,I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves Adidas and buys them often. She loves her Christmas gift.
363245,1,"A classic shoe and still my favorite after all these years. Can't beat the price either with what sneakers cost these days. I no longer use my CTs for working out, exercise, aerobics, running or anything like that and wouldn't recommend that anybody else do so either. The cushioning is the same as it used to be back in the day, which is to say there is none. But for everyday walking, hanging out around the house, or indulging in a little retro fun these really are great shoes."
83109,1,"I love these flip flops! I had a pair a few years ago, and my dog chewed them. I searched on Amazon and found another pair. They have a great arch support, are comfortable to walk in, and feel great on your feet."
2681,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
163477,1,These are very comfort running shoes and I will definitely buy a second pair soon.
366390,1,"Great. The good price and fast ship. The sandals are great for the ocean, sailing and I just wore mine for Kayaking. You can get the wet and they don't smell and they dry fast."
137106,1,"These were ordered as a gift in a size 12. Yes, they had them. The came beautifuly wrapped and arrived within a few days from order. Yes, I waited until the last min to order and they arrived just in time for Holidays. Reasonable and I didn't have to leave my home. Perfect for basketball! They were well received! Now, my daughter wants a pair. Love Amazon!"
59317,1,"After having worn these boots for hundreds of miles in several different countries for over a year, I can safely say that they are a great pair of hiking boots for general purposes and I highly recommend them to anyone.Don't look any further."
314531,1,"Really happy with my purchase. This is the second pair of Propet' I've purchased. The first pair was a short all weather boot. I love the side zipper and the wide sizing. The second pair is a pair of sandals, brick color is great. Comfy, good support."
238003,0,These run too narrow over the arch of the foot. Keep this in mind when ordering.Aside form that they seem well constructed and comfortable.
368712,1,Stone color Birkenstock Arizona Birkibuc sandal - Great value for a great shoe with a color that will go with anything.
386799,1,"I LOVE THESE VANS! they look so sick and skate well, though not very durable considering the canvas.but packaging was great and was delivered sooner then expected ordered it monday and got it thurday.Great service awesome shoe"
191714,1,"Like all Easy Spirit Shoes, these are great. Order arrived a few days after placing the order. High quality shoes at a great price."
69037,1,This was a great little shoe. It is so cute and unique... got lots of attention and handles the abuse my one year old can dish out ;)
318974,1,Only think I did not like was the back was week. But I am the slip on and go type
181056,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
19597,1,"Hmmmm! where do i start, back in 1989I was in a bad car accident, which messed up my ankle Ipurchased this shoe and it worked perfectlybecause i knew that my foot would never get better, and concernedthat the ""shoe"" might be discontinued, I purchased 10 pairs!!after 22 years I was down to my last pair (i am rough on shoes.expecting to pay 99.00 per pair I was delighted to only pay about60 here on amazon.Jim from pa THIS IS A GREAT SHOE!!!"
353725,1,Good-looking and comfortable--a bit retro in look. Have been worn daily since purchase---very satisfied.
305325,1,"The best shoe around if you are looking for good arch support. They are light weight so walking is effortless. Try them, you'll like them."
308621,0,"I used to have a pair of these a few years back and they were great boots lasted me a long time so I saw these and bought them thinking they were the same boot because they had the same name, I was wrong. The material or lack of materials I should say is very apparent. The older version had thicker leather, so it supported my ankles and feet better. They cut a few corners to keep their cost down. When I put on my old pair I still have I could tell the newer version was made cheaper, the laces are already frayed and the bottoms are wearing pretty fast and the leather across the top of the boot is half as thick as the older version. Ok boot, definitely not a work boot."
20970,1,"FOR ME, THE EASY SPIRT ""MOTION"" SHOE IS T_H_E PERFECT SHOE. I am unable to wear heels, (long story) -- but these shoes, which lace up as in any true oxford, have a streamlined look that many other oxford shoes today, burdened as they are with extra outside padding, do not. The result is, that this is indeed a SLIM, WALKING shoe, not a bulky sports shoe. It is as neat and pretty as any woman's oxford shoe can be.This is a very, very comfortable shoe. It is not quite accurate to say it is like walking on air --but it IS as comortable as a shoe can be, I believe, without going to the expense of custom-made shoes.When a shoe comes in many, many colours, you KNOW it has to be a GOOD shoe. Because so many people are buying it, the manufacturer can afford to branch out and make it in many different colours. For a very long time, I happily wore the WHITE color of this shoe, whilst my mom wore the WHEAT colour. We were both very happy with them!Then, I saw in a well-known catalogue, that they are available from the store associated with that catalogue, (on special order only), in G O L D colour! And not just a ""goldEN"" colour -- but a true, gold foil colour! And at the same price as all the other colours! All that ""special ordering"" the gold (foil) shoes, was to wait a few weeks longer.I have now worn the (shiny!) gold (foil) colour of Easy Spirit ""Motion"" shoes for a few years. I have gotten several very nice complimnts on them as well! And no wonder -- they look almost like golden-colour ""bronzedd"" baby shoes, or, are somewhat similar to the sheen in Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret's flat pumps, in the famous ""double negative"" picture, by Marcus Adams -- taken in Buckingham Palace, with their mother, father, and corgi dog. The picture is in black and white, so I have no idea if the Princesses wore gold or silver pumps in it. But -- the foil-bright SHINE is the same! In the words of the classic song... "" Oh.....dem golden slippers....! "" : )As I've said, I've gotten several compliments on my golden oxford Easy Spirit motion shoes. For someone who cannot wear a heel above a half-an-inch, this is doubly gratifying. HOWEVER, I DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE 'GOLD' (FOIL), COLOUR OF THESE SHOES HERE ON AMAZON, and so must get my shoes elsewhere. Sometimes at an even more expensive price, and a longer wait.It would be nice to have a ""Gold Easy-Spirit Motion Community"" here on Amazon. I really would like to get together with others who wear, not only Easy Spirit Motion shoes, but the Gold Foil Colour of Easy-Spirit Motion shoes. I hope to see them here on Amazon soon, so that others may experience the joy of being complimented, often, on THEIR Gold-Foil colour Easy Spirit Motion shoes, too!"
171760,0,The shoe fits well. It is not a good walking shoe as it offers no support. I am very concerned about turning my foot.
253916,0,"I was looking for a basic pair of sneakers that are good for walking. These shoes seem to fit my purpose and are on sale for a pretty good price. They are true to size and width, but not as comfortable as I thought. Walking in them for a mere ten minutes hurt my right foot both in the toe area and heel. I cannot figure out why it is the case..."
192592,1,"This shoe was superb when I used it for my highschool football team. I was able to run my fastest and not feel dragged down by a pound of lead, with out the high cut ankle support I was able to cut faster and throw off almost all of my defenders. This shoe really did enhance my perfromance. Ideal for wide receivers and running backs."
259274,1,"I had the experience of having to exchange these shoes. It was fairly simple and I had no issues. I ordered them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They arrived fairly quickly in the mail. Though we ordered her normal size, they were about 1/2 size too large. So I followed the online instructions and sent them back for an exchange. I received a replacement in just a little over a week. I was impressed with the quick turnaround. The only drawback is that I had to pay to ship them back and also include a check for $7.99 to cover shipping of the new shoes."
189696,1,This is a great product for those of you who love basketball. the torsion system looks great and so does the shoe. It is well worth the price. Only con is that it gets dirty easily
309959,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
162649,1,"I bought it on sale for only 18 dollars. fit perfectly. great for a long walk , very comfy."
140095,1,"I've purchased these shoes several times over. They are the most comfortable shoes right out of the box. They fit well, wear well and look great. You cannot go wrong with these winners."
359876,1,"High quality shoe--more than expected. Fit perfectly and very comfortable. Purchased as an Easter shoe, and beautiful! Will wear for a long while."
71078,1,"Okay, I have a typical American guy foot, or should I say feet. My left is slightly larger than the right. Added to the fact that I wear an 11EE. Add snow, and I could use them for skis. I reallly wanted a style boot that is a cut above the normal western boot that I currently wear. Also, I do some entertaining on the side, and need a boot more ""theatrical"" in look. I came across the Giorgio Brutine Men's line. Sleek, contempary and very afordable. Unbelieveably, my size was listed. Now keep in mind, while American size was listed, the shoes are made for European men's feet which are typically narrow. When the shoes arrived, a day early, they looked beautiful, and not my size; or, at least I thought so. The boot had fine leather, a rugged zipper, full leather sole with no visable stitching...very nice. But as I held them in my hands, I knew they wouldn't fit. The size stamped inside said ""11W."" Okay, let's give them and try and be prepared to send them back. Wearing a dress sock, I slipped on the boots...and I mean ""slipped."" They fit perfectly. My feet were in leather heaven. I could not believe what I was seeing and feeling. For the very first time in my audult life, I was wearing an Italian styled boot that felt like butter on my feet. I have been given many compliments on how well they look. I could really not be more satisfied."
195999,1,Has both cushioning and support!! My first pair of flipflops in years after several foot surgeries. Absolutely love them! After several days I purchased a second pair.
25868,1,The butterfly is so cute! It's nice to have something distinguishing without having to get a crazy color. I use these shoes for powerlifting as well as everyday wear. I visited the seller's website and they have a pretty large variety of designs. Would like to see some in kids' sizes but I couldn't be happier with my new Chucks!
158257,1,"I got these shoes for my boyfriend, and there was absolutely NO other place that had these in his size!! I ordered them, and they came in WAY earlier than I expected! Even earlier than the shipping expectancy! Ill buy Chucks from here for now on!"
36062,1,"OMG! Everthing you would want in a shoe it's true to size, it's super comfortable, sexy, an attention grabber and it seems like it was made just for my feet. You can wear it all day to work straight into a fun afternoon without great discomfort as the leather is soft. This shoe is a winner and a MUST BUY!!!!!"
304702,1,"The shipment of these shoes arrived ahead of schedule, in good order. This is my third purchase of this style (these are the first in black)---wouldn't be without them.For me, at least, they are an exceptionally comfortable fit, although a bit stiff at initial wearing.I think the strongest point is they are long-wearing--my first ones are about 20 years old, still look good and draw complements."
268294,0,"This bag is very unique and interesting. It stands out and gets tons of attention. The size is great and the inside compartments make life easier. I adore this bag, however, it is way too heavy! I use it for school books and materials but after just a day of use my shoulder was in pain. 3 days later my arm and shoulder are still sore! I reccomend the bag but don't put too much in it cause you'll regret it!"
240501,1,"I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found."
127216,1,These are some of the best steel toes the only thing is one of the hooks for the laces broke but still cool
112944,1,"My husband has been wearing this brand of shoe for over 20 years. He always has two pair working. One for yard work and one for wearing when we leave the house. They always fit, wear for years and look sharp when he wants to dress us a little. We never have to worry about the fit when ordering as they are always true to size. He is able to take them straight out of the box and wear with no breaking in period. We now have to purchase these over the internet as our local stores no longer carry them. Hopefully Rockport will not discontinue making these wonderful shoes."
322467,1,"I followed a lot of people review that said you had to order a size up because they ran small - IT'S NOT TRUE. I just had to return mine because they were OBVIOUSLY too big.I'm a 7.5 N foot. I ordered an 8.5 W N like people suggested, but it was too big. I'm debating now on buying either a 7.5 or an 8. I say buy your street size and go from there so you can tell EXACTLY how to proceed.The shoes themselves came quickly and were so beautiful, so sad I have to wait for my refund to process before I can get the proper shoe..."
59932,1,"Had these for a little over six months now. I've been hiking in the forest, rock hopping, walking all day in the city in these shoes. My feet have never hurt after wearing them all day."
159404,1,These shoes were 20$ cheaper than the sale price on the converse website. The shoes seem to be authentic. Shipping was fast.
254809,1,This is an old standard. I used to wear these all the time when I was a young man. Nice getting reacquainted. Clark's quality seems to be one of the few constants in footwear.
230456,1,"Simply said, it's the right shoe at the right price for the ballet dance classes. I was able to find the right size and a half."
209114,1,These shoes have been the traditional Xmas gift to my sail boating son-in-law for 20+ years. He will not wear any other boat shoe. The 9 wide is a perfect fit. Most other brands do not come in wide.
69780,1,These shoes are so pretty on my foot. I received compliments on them. They are very comfortable and do not slide around on my foot. I am going to order another pair in a different color since I like them so well.
236600,1,Thank you! Quick service and just as described. Perfect fit!
231469,1,I've worn these sandals all summer and they're great. What I really love is they have a little bit of arch support so you can walk in them forever without your feet getting sore and achy. Plus they're very cute. I've gotten tons of complements on them! And you can't beat the price!
198859,1,"Time-tested. This shoe goes really well with a great number of things, and I find myself wearing them even when the snow is piled high solely because I like the look.Protip: if it's rainy/snowy, be sure that your laces are tied in a manner that doesn't allow you to step on them, because if you do, you'll get the laces dirty, which, in turn, will cause them to fling up while you're walking and cover your shoes in wet, dirty water, making short work of the pristine, white look."
45170,1,"This is a beautiful, well-made dress shoe that combines traditional oxford design with high quality materials. It features a smooth, full grain, blemishless, fully lined, leather upper, and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches*. There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.I got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords (two different models). So, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct. If I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.* an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date. I will update this review if I discover that I have this problem also."
42036,1,"This shoe has no ""break in"" period. This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have every worn straight from the box. I hope they hold up, seems to."
302911,1,Most comfortable she I have ever had Very soft leather good support good looking may buy another pair in another color
313442,1,My son wears these boots he had them for like two months and they still look new and the price was great saved lots of money
28786,1,"Propet makes excellent shoes, all types, their sandals are my favorite and this style is the most comfortable I have every worn."
68465,1,"these are smaller, nice but smaller, order at least .5 higher that your normal size."
326554,1,"I really like these flip flops, but when I walk in them they make a lot of noise. The flip flop noise if you know what I mean! They are the loudest flip flops I have ever owned. When I walk I try to hold them closer to my foot (so they won't be so loud), but it does not seem to work. Other than that, it did take alittle while to get use to the arch support. I have only ever had flat flip flops. I'm not sure if they are the best for walking long distances which is what I wanted. But basically they are comfortable and look nice."
93463,1,"I've always liked LifeStride shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. I'll definitely buy a pair again, soon."
27445,1,"I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years. I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street. They are VERY COMFORTABLE, ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe.They felt like a favorite, comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on...SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction,logging or concrete work. Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT, I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread, giving you fair traction in the grass, snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also...the boot's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor, while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact. Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection. I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof, you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment. KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather, material, sewn seams splitting or tearing, and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off, however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So, I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots...Order a bit thicker,round nylon boot laces, instead of the flat, cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However, trust me, your wife will remind you,often, to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought,have been just as happy with, are the White's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $500.00The FARM BOOTS are a great deal! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care /pride in the product,a good design philosophy, used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country, when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
96676,1,These slippers are very comfortable and durable for the price . I compared them to at least 7 other pairs before purchasing them . They have a very durable anti-slip sole .
277156,1,"Bought these for my wife. Just what I was looking for. Perfect fit (since there are no half sizes, buyer needs to go down to next full size). E.g., If you are an 7 1/2, you need to order the 7."
296680,0,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
230928,1,Bought these for racquetball and I have to say that they are really comfortable right out of the box. I can't give a long term review as I've only worn the shoes twice. But they seem to mold right to your feet...no sliding around inside the shoe.They fit true to size. Very happy with the shoes and shipping was terrific as always.
26466,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice. They were a good fit, I ordered a half size larger then what I wear because I wear a heavy sock and needed the extra room. I told some of my other Santa friends about these and they each got a pair too. We all wore them at our Santa school in Santa Claus, Indiana and were they ever a big hit with the other Santa's. Everything was sent as described and I will buy from again."
276830,1,"I have only wore these boots a couple of times, so I may be reviewing them too soon. As other reviewers have stated they don't seem to need a break in period, but there is a certain &#34;learning&#34; period. I say this as a person who literally has worn nothing but tennis shoes for years. The learning is getting used to the extra weight and bulk on your feet. I bought these to be a part of my &#34;bug out&#34; plan. I will soon be going on a real hike on rougher terrain to see how they feel then. Plus until I have put many more mile on them to see how they hold up I can't say for sure how many stars they deserve. I give them 4 for now and assuming 200-300 miles from now they are still in good shape I would change it to 5."
385111,1,I wish I had seen the 1/2 size larger recommendation. Mine are 1/2 size too small! Nice boots though.
97177,2,"I normally love Naturalizer shoes, but these were so uncomfortable that they actually physically hurt to wear. I think the design of the shoe is too narrow towards the toe so your feet end up extremely squished together. It was so bad that I don't think even a bigger size would have helped so I sadly returned them."
102994,1,The shoes were as described and my son never wanted to take them off. They were well constructed and looked good on.
236921,1,i have been looking for these sandles for a long time i used to have a pair years ago and when i found them i was so happy they fit good and go with everything thanks
274662,1,"Excellent! Great product, great fit. Best price anywhere. Actually I still have these and wear them every day. I am actually going to order another pair very soon. Thanx"
382263,1,"This is my second pair, in as many years. Comfortable, nice hieght and affordable."
257699,1,",.RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED .."
134820,1,"I bought these a half size bigger than normal for me after reading the previous reviews (most were saying these run small). Should have stuck to my actual shoe size because now I have a pair that is just a little too big. Otherwise, nice, durable outside shoe and good for all my outdoor activities."
113080,0,My daughter really likes these shoes. To me they make about as much sense as throwing marbles on the floor and then trying to walk across it.
171820,2,"These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear. The leathery outside rubs away easily, leaving a greenish scuff underneath. They probably won't be very durable for much longer. Also, I couldn't tell in the picture, but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle. It is leather all the way from toe to ankle."
205445,0,"Not wild about the quality of leather. But the color was right for the outfit and it works, so I kept it. Fit is fine."
44509,1,"As an employee at Nordstrom, I was looking for a small purse to carry my keys, wallet, cell, and mp3, along with a few other necessities while at work. Not wanting to spend an entire paycheck on a purse, and having the urge to get something that was a little more sustainable than the average bag, I stuck with this adorable martini bag.It's an awesome bag, a great conversation piece, and a fun step towards sustainable living. My only complaint is that the handle is a bit rough material wise and consequently can be a little uncomfortable to hold when trying to handle something with both hands. Overall, great bag... I absolutely love it and am proud to sport something made out recycled materials. :)"
339789,1,I wanted red converse sneakers and could only find them at this merchant online--they were priced below $30 and arrived in less than three days looking just as described.
83711,1,I first bought these on my honeymoon many years ago. We are now fortunate enough to live at the beach and I live in these shoes and have many colors of the same style. Shape to your feet wonderfully!!!!
189687,0,"but the only thing is that it is not real leather as it discribed. Inside the shoes, it says 'all Manmade'"
352175,0,"The shoes looked great and fit fairly well, but every step was a squeak squeak. I had to send them back.Delivery and return were both handled very well, though."
239279,1,"I bought this shoe in late March and have logged many miles both on and off the road! It gets wet, muddy, and even had some snow on it early in the season but keeps on kickin'! It hasn't stretched...or lost it's form in any way! I was concerned the velcro would stretch and/or wear before the shoe wore out. So far..so good! I ride 5 days a week with average ride of approx 13 miles. Throw in a road ride, some longer rides... this shoe is impressive. Feels just as comfy as the first time I slipped it on. I will only buy SIDI for now on! My only complaint is the very front has some lifting in the leather. This is mainly due to the abuse I have put it through. I'm checking into adhesive that will prevent it from further peeling!"
364474,1,"After seeing all the reviews about this shoe, I wanted to actually physically try on a pair before buying to make sure of the size. I love these shoes. They're comfortable and just great. I just wanted to post about the size difference I experienced. I have been wearing size (male) 10.5 for years now. I've bought many different shoes from different brands and this is always my style. After trying on many pairs of these shoes I finally found my size for these shoes. 8.5. A full two sizes lower! 8 was too tight and 9 was a bit too big."
177294,1,"This review is very deserving of 5 stars. My boyfriend needed a new pair of chucks for work that matched his uniform... we don't wear many other types of shoes.. Love chuck taylors! 5 stars for fast shipping, and low price. Thanks!"
347941,1,GOOD FIT & COLOR! NICE FOR SUMMER WEAR WITH SHORTS! NO SOCKS! A GOOD VALUE! RPM
315335,1,"Not only nice but comfortable and smooth. Bought it for my 12 yr. old daughter and she loves having her own bowling shoes, but the best is that she likes them so much that she wishes to wear them daily... Excellent price."
180119,1,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR TEAM, THEY ARE TRULY RELIABLE AND TIMELY I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PROVIDER AMONG MY FRIENDS."
329056,1,"Best, Most Comfortable Lace Up Boot Ever!!Hard to find and very glad I did. Light, Warm & Dry.... top notch boots."
63365,1,So comfy and goes with any outfit. Great for everyday wear and you look cool too. I literally wear them everyday.
231353,1,"I have had these boots for 6 years now. I live in Indiana and mainly wear these boots to go sleding, tubing and shoveling snow. These boots have always kept my feet warm and dry. My shoe size is 10.5 I bought size 11 and they fit great with just regular socks and no problems with 1 pair of reg. socks and a pair of wool socks together. With the weather being in the teens and spending a few ours doing light activity in the snow my feet stay warm and dry. Every year before the weather gets really cold I take these boots out side and spray them with water repellant spray( I do this to all the family boots). They are also very comfortable to wear."
270736,1,"When these wear out, I just come to Amazon and buy another pair of size 14's. The Indoor/Outdoop rubber sole last at least a year as much as I wear them. The fuzzy inside is nice in the winter. It doesn't slip around on my foot like some flip flop slippers do. Worth the money, definately."
126229,1,"The shoe looks and feels great! My only complaint is that after being on my feet all day (my job requires it), my feet were a little sore. I don't think these shoes have as good of arch support as some that I have had, but I'm still happy with the purchase."
362125,1,I bought these in pink cause I thought they would look good with all the gray I have. I have about 4 other pairs of these in other colors.Flexible shoe. Fast shipping and great price
76490,1,"These shoes are perfect in every way! They are cute, comfortable, light-weight and so handy! Excellent shoe for the Summer! I own the turquoise color, which is very cute. I think I'm going to buy another pair!"
385573,1,"I live in these, every day and all year round. This is my second pair because I wore the first ones out completely. Great if you have wider feet. Most women's crocs are a B width, these are the unisex size. Everyone loves how they look, very cute! Also, they don't slip off your feet at all."
300311,1,Great fit and super comfortable. I wear them everyday. I broke my ankle a few months ago and needed some comfortable shoes to wear with my brace. These were perfect and much more stylish than regular old running shoes.
200948,1,"These are gorgeous. For being such a high heel, they are reasonably comfortable. They look very classy on. I love them. I have two pairs. One in black and one pair in brown."
219318,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
261199,1,"The shoes arrived quickly, size was correct and shoes were exactly what we needed! Price was lower than any of the local vendors! Thanks!"
98091,1,Looking for a boot with tasteful proportions was difficult until I found these. They're rugged yet stylish. The only downside is a lack of cushion.
293826,1,"5-10 rubber is great - very sticky. This shoe is also good if you have a narrow heel. I can heel-hook in these and they don't slip. The toe box is on the pointy side. This shoe is not for you if you have a wide foot. Like most shoes when new, they might leave your feet red the first few times worn (from the dye), and can be tight at first. Mine felt fine after I broke them in (this took about 10 or so climbs, if memory serves)"
171747,1,"These are my favourite shoes. They go with everything and are as comfy as sneakers. I have very wide, hard to fit feet, but thanks to Propet's wide selection of widths, I got a perfect fit!"
225878,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
71934,1,"IF you go to my facebook page KD ALLEN and click on my photos you will see a shot of me wearing these shoes while in Africa. I've also worn them walking in the Andes (not climbing mountains, but climbing hilly cobblestone streets), the Amazon jungles, and all over Europe. I remember standing in a crowd lined up to get into the Sistine Chapel and there stood a young Japanese college student who was wearing the same shoes! We nodded and pointed to each other's shoes and smiled in agreement: these shoes are wonderful for travel.They are lightweight, comfortable, and have non-skid soles. They are versatile and can be worn with practically any outfit. Yes, they may have some odor, but they also air out quickly and can handle going into water (i.e. rain).I agree the support could be firmer, but I don't expect these shoes to work the like a pair of hiking sneakers. I usually purchase one pair of these a year, at the start of whatever travel adventure I am on. That is when they are at their firmest and I need the most support. When I return home I continue to wear them in my daily routines. By the end of the year they are fairly flattened out but they have enough life in them for short trips to the grocery store, etc. Good enough for $50, but even better if I can find them at a lower price on eBay.I have a teen daughter who is always on my case about these shoes. She says they are permanently affixed to my feet, and she asked me to buy another style of shoe just so she could see me in something else. Funny that she never tells her dad to switch out of his Topsider boatshoes.BTW, for those of you (like myself) who love this cut of shoe, Skechers has come out with some other colors and material that are almost identical to the Sightsee. They have the same sole, the same velcro strap, the same shape; it's just the mesh is in a different place, and/or there may be a different design to the upper. All in all the same shoe."
169838,1,"These boots were military issue for me. I put them in my wall locker and rarely used them. Those who live in the north could probably recommend the best boot for cold weather, but I live in Southern Louisiana and I do not often have need of a cold weather boot. However, this year (December 2009) we got four inches of snow! This was my first time to really test this boot. I sloshed around in icy water and snow for most of the day and never noticed the cold. My feet stayed dry and warm all day. I was really impressed."
364647,1,"Quality, classic style, comfort....you can't go wrong with a pair of Chuck Taylors. Great for weightlifting/powerlifting. Thin sole is good for dealifting."
291814,1,Purchased these boots for cowboy costume for Halloween--however they will be worn alot more! Good quality product and fit.
214592,1,"I bought these in the black womens size 8 (I normally wear an 8). The boots, once on fit great. However, getting them on is a struggle. The wool liners are SO tight! I have to put the liners on first, then slip them into the boots. But it takes 15 minutes just to get the liners on. They are just very narrow and snug (I don't have wide feet). But the boot without the liner is huge! So, I am hoping that the liners stretch out a little. Other than that, they are great and I'm glad that I have them. Once the liners are on and my foot is in the boot, they fit as I expected and are comfortable."
60274,1,These shoes work excellent in a lot water conditions. My husband has been using them for more than 4 years. We tried others brands but this ones are the best.
203214,1,"i bought the keen H2 sandal so i will have a water sandal for the summer. also it is nice to have a closed toe sandal when gardening or doing work around my house. i have not had a chance to wear this sandal in the water yet. the keen H2 sandal is very comfortable, with lots of room for my toes, which i like. i had the brown/turquois sandal and returned it for the grey. i think the grey looks better with more of the clothes that i wear."
171549,1,I have purchased this same shoe in 3 colors over the years.I love Mocs and especially those made of deerskin or moose hide as they are supple and conform to the contour of you feet and then fit like a glove.I say - buy them.
252211,1,Please get some more sizes in. I need to buy a few new pairs! These are the best shoe on earth!
277721,1,"My husband has been wearing this paticular Hi-Tec Altitude IV WP boot for about 5 years. He says they are comfortable right away....no break in time. He is a farmer (wheat & dates) and also a commercial tuna fisherman. He does pretty much everything in his boots and loves them. They are also great hikers. We always carry a new boot for when the others just can't make another day or he wants to ""dress"" up. He is flat footed, so wears an ortho in it. His favorite shoe ever."
99053,1,"On a recent visit, my daughter had lamented about the trouble that she was having finding Chuck Taylor Converse shoes in royal blue. She claimed that she and my father in law had been trying unsuccessfully for sometime to find the shoes. With my recent successes purchasing things on Amazon, I went in, found the shoes, ordered them, and before we were done with the conversation had them on their way.They arrived within the week, and she is happy, which makes me happy."
356650,1,Purchased as a gift for a very discriminating (picky) person and she loves them. Says the fit and comfort are excellent. Highly recommended.
348624,1,The quality and price of these boots were great. I received the shipment very quickly. I would definately do business with this merchant again.
212168,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
123209,1,"I've owned Skechers before and they've always been excellent. However, this particular pair is the best of all the Skechers I've owned. They are extremely comfortable and generously cut for just a medium width. I would recommend them to anyone."
75916,1,"I have worn many clark shoes and there very comfortable, however this shoe becomes uncomfortable after wearing it for a long period of time because of the majority of your weight is on the front part of your foot."
17502,1,"I love these shoes a LOT! The shipping was super fast and the shoes are just GREAT!!! I don't want to take them off, they're so comfortable and very pretty. An added bonus: this company was so kind and sent a purse sized hand sanitizer. That was very thoughtful of them. I highly recommend this seller to anyone that loves great shoes, great prices and super fast shipping. Thank you for making this a happy friday."
71348,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
42800,1,"I couldn't believe that the shoe would be a full size too large so I went with a half size smaller, and was wrong. A full size smaller than normal is, if anything, still slightly large. But a fine shoe!"
227489,1,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
283599,1,"I was hesitant to buy a pair of shoes online but you don't often see the Eastland brand in my area. I fell in love with the simple lines of this shoe. Delivery was up to Amazon standards (customer-focused!). When I tried the shoes on they were heavenly! Sturdy, top-quality leather, and most-important, VERY COMFORTABLE. I sometimes wear a wide but the shoe is roomy with no constricting seams- true to size. I have had many compliments on them. I needed no break-in period for these shoes and that says a lot!!"
126011,0,"i was so excited to get these shoes because they i love the look of the patent leather and the cork sole combination. however, these fit very tight and i have a normal medium width foot. the footbed is too narrow so the sides of your feet kind of spill over the side...not very pretty."
331222,1,"Nice shoes, nice price, nice color. Hubby loves them. Would buy more if he likes to have some other colors."
120238,0,"I bought these as I needed a slightly ""dressier"" sandal than my chacos. While these are comfy, they provide very little support, and the fact that they mold so easily was a downside for me. I have fallen arches, and my feet just squished the arch support in these shoes, they did nothing for supporting my foot. They're fairly comfy, but again, I don't recommend them if you're looking for a sandal with good support.Like others, I did find I needed to ""round up."" I usually wear a 9 or 9 1/2, and the 10 fits me perfectly."
124589,1,"i owned this pair for 6 years and was looking for the exact ones and found them on amazon , great find. I have paid much more for red wings and others but these do not want to wear out."
92698,0,"Poor quality, but works if you are gentle and not trying to stretch a shoe to a new size. Will elongate and stretch width wise. Do a little at a time, and don't expect miracles, but it will work in the end. Can't be too rough or wrench on it. No instruction provided."
9486,1,"Love these shoes. Hiked the Grand Canyon in them and they were very comfortable and have great traction. People who were hiking with me wearing gym shoes had several issues with sliding, but not once did I slide on the gravel on the trails. After the hike, everyone wanted a pair."
36502,1,"These shoes are exactly what I wanted! I needed a comfortable, light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase. Super fast shipping, and a beautiful product."
46550,1,I love the purse. It's small and can still fit all of my things. It's convenient and stays organized! Great quality! Thank you! Very satisfied with my purchase.
277360,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
142018,1,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
278749,1,First day with these boots and I just got back from a hard 2hr hike. These boots did awesome! I plan to continue buying these boots as needed:)
118677,1,My three year old grandson decided he didn't want to take dance lessons afterall. His two year sister is showing him up for sure. She loves her dance lessons.
30420,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
315567,1,I had a pair of Sebago penny loafers years ago. The 9D size fits well and goes well with khakis or jeans. Some D width shoes fit loose....not the case with this loafer.
119210,1,"I really like these shoes! These are really comfortable. I walk and stand, a lot, during my day and need a shoe that has some cushion and support. These are perfect in that regard. I have a slightly narrow foot and usually order an average (M) width. I find these shoes run a little to the narrow side. You may want want to order the wide width."
20242,1,"Excellent product, although the leather scuffs easily. Recommendation: prep shoes with Lexol conditioner. Otherwise, the shoe fits like a glove - comfortable, with good support."
384645,1,"Comfortable, classic. Birkenstocks but cooler. I wear them everywhere.Arrived on time and as promised."
199328,1,"I have to say that I love this brand. The shoes lasted a good time for me. The only problem I had, is that I had to be very careful not to get them dirty or stained."
274859,1,Overall pretty good books. I just went on a 3 day Horn Hunting Hike in North East Wyoming and these boots held up good. The only downside was the boots need to be treated before plowing through snow drifts. My feet did get wet. Luckily I did have polypropelene liner socks with wool outer socks so my feet did not blister or get cold. Considering the extreme terrain and weather these boots served me well.
92723,2,Have had this stretcher for less than 60 days and after stretching only 2 pairs of shoes it is now completely broken beyond use.Threading is stripped and it will no longer screw open OR closed. It's frozen stuck halfway open.Next time I'll invest in a more expensive stretcher and hope the quality reflects the larger investment.
67908,1,"Love these Timberlands that I got for a great price on Amazon. Quality, well-made, and will last beyond forever here in Southwest Florida where (hopefully) we only need shoes for a month every year. But the squeak! They can hear me coming from the next zip code over! I've tried everything from shoe polish (no good) to cooking spray (much better), but it wears off before long and I'm back to making a racket!"
342763,1,Shoes are Great! When you buy make your order for a smaller size. I ordered size 11 and they are plenty long enough. You should order at least 1/2 size smaller. Overall shoes are just like you'd expect from Converse.
239924,1,"These are extremely good sneakers! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal. Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars. These are great basic shoes. An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform. I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern. These are very flexable shoes, the laces are better than other brands. These sell for around $30 generally. For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market. If you like old school Converse, Jack Purcell, Vans then I think you'll be very happy to own these classic shoes. A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans. Just go with the originals! If I could afforf it I'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now. The other styles Keds now makes look great as well. If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear. I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities. No downsides to these that I can see. 5 stars!!"
121857,1,"I got these sandals because my boyfriend had them and they're awesome. Super comfortable, and who could complain about the bottle opener on the bottom? Refrained from buying one of the girl's options because the colors aren't so great. These sandals are seriously great, though."
139310,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100. I jog/walked a marathon in these a few months ago and they were great--no blisters, no nothing. I would definately purchase these shoes again, especially at the prices offered by Amazon!!!!"
9751,0,"Very pretty on; however, even though they are the right size the slip off my feet from the back. Fit well in the front so couldn't order a smaller size. Shoe gave me blisters both times I wore it."
304643,1,"I own 4 pairs of Naughty Monkey shoes. There are not many shoes that comapre to them, even though they are high heels, they are very comfortable."
61745,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
125181,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
16151,1,I like the way they look-nice and neat.They are soft and comfortable. One thing though-when I wore them on a rainy day it felt kinda slippery on the road.
18818,1,Got theses for My wife for a modeling job she had.... She has tons of shoes that kill her feet and after shooting in for a few hours her feet were still feeling good.... She is normally a 5.5 and She got a size 6 and they fit her just slightly loose. Shipping was fast and as expected
219091,1,"I've always loved Chinese Laundry shoes because they are SO COMFORTABLE! This company has half a brain and pads the insoles. So even if you're wearing 5"" heels, your feet aren't dying in 2 hours. These are no exception. They're extremely comfortable, easy to walk in and the leather is good quality. I can't say enough good things about these."
1021,1,This was the best out there for the money. Bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. Very water proof after playing in the snow with the kids...
383196,1,I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy. I need the wide width. The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo
157639,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
346407,1,"If you buy a Chuck Taylor, you know want you want, they are the classics, fits right usually I use 7 1/2 but in this case the 8 size fits better, most comfortable."
333351,2,"to PUT IT CRAP,i didnt get the ADDIDAS 11 ORIGINALS i requested,instead i recieved some awful T.MAC bigfoot basketball shoe,which i promptly gave to the local childrens hospital MERRY XMAS. BOB."
382492,1,bought them for my daughter last summer among a few others and I can truly say that they are worth every penny. Very durable. I highly recommend this product. Comfortable too.
173002,1,I have purchased several of these eel skin coin purses. the quality of the eel skin is very good but the clasp or the hinges on the purse breaks. I love the size and that i can put my car key and coins and bills in it and do not have to take my pocket book if I dont need to use it. I am now trying to decide if I want to order another one. This is the 3rd one in probably 2 years.
30717,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
26082,1,"If you are an avid runner that appreciates comfortable shoes, then buy these shoes. The 991 is the only shoe that I have purchased more than once. I have tried many others and these are my favorite."
349941,1,"These stiletto heeled wonders just scream ""Sexy!"" True, no 4-1/2 inch heeled shoe is ever completely comfortable, but this shoe does a nice job of it. And, when it comes to looks, this shoe is a knockout! The zip-closed back means that there are no buckles to break the shoes' lines, so they look quite elegant on your feet.If you are looking for high heeled shoes for a formal occasion, then this is a good shoe to get. And, if you are looking for a sexy stiletto to accompany your lingerie (or nothing at all!) then this is a great shoe to get.(Review of Hot Multi-Ankle Band Stilettos from Hot Fash Shoes - HILTON Gold)"
152227,1,I am very pleased with my purchase; color is great and shoes are totally comfortable. I plan to order additional pairs.
299056,1,"I recommend it because it is a very comfortable, the purchase was made without any problems, the shipping was rather quickly and I am very comfortable with the purchase made.Thank you."
323066,1,"These are great shoes for long distance riding, but a pain to clip in - they tend to slide around a lot."
341021,1,"This was easy enough to buy, but the postage was a bit much. Good pair of boots, not so amazing with timing or cost. Cheers anyway etc."
297638,1,"Look sharp at the gym. Kind of squeeky when wet. I throw them in the washing machine to clean them. I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift ...j.g. Staten Island, NY"
85259,1,Product is great. My husband has worn same exact shoe for 7 years. Needed to re-order. Unfortunately his foot has widened over the years and it was too narrow. Wanted to exchange it but does not come in a wider size so had to return. Sorely disappointed
167233,1,"After a couple of tries, I got the right size in this shoe for me, and I wear it often. It was roomy enough to be able to put an extra cushion insole under the one that came with it to make it even more comfortable. I prefer this style over the other traveltime mules because of the airholes on the side..even mules can become hot in very hot weather...great for all the in and out of the house trips (I don't wear shoes in the house) that I do. Nice construction, and cute looking for a casual shoe."
101540,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
135826,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
261915,1,"This boot is very light weight very comforable, the leather soal is very thin that's why the boot is so light. This boot will not wear as well as other boots which are much more in price, but at the price you can buy 2 for the price of one. You do not have to break this boot in, but it on and you will feel you have been wearing this boot for weeks! I have been buying this boot for years, I own my own business and I'm on my feet all day 10 hours plus. I put this new boot on and 10+ hours later when I go home my feet are in good shape! Tell me what other boot for the price can do that! This boot is made in India and I truly hope this never changes.For this boot and no other shoe I am a Nun Bush supporter!!!!!"
312874,1,My husband wanted a pair of crocs for an upcoming fishing trip. I purchased the XL for him as he's a size 10 1/2 - 11. They fit him perfectly and the color is just right (khaki). So far so good.....The crocs were put to use on a recent fishing trip and worked great.
261004,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
131438,1,"I couldn't wait to try these flip-flops on and now that I have, I am SO GLAD I bought them! They are the most comfortable pair of flip-flops I've ever had!! The part between the toes that normally irritates me with other flip-flops I've worn is actually comfortable! I can't believe it! :) The sizes do run a little small, but I ordered a 9 and I'm an 8 1/2 and they're a perfect fit! :) Awesome, awesome shoes!! :)"
246491,1,"one of the most comfortable heels, but like most jessica simpson shoe's i did have to get half a size bigger"
278210,1,"I live in northern Minnesota and these are great for winter. Warm, waterproof and good grip on the icy sidewalks. Very comfortable too. I have a very nice pair of Sorel winter boots but they are HEAVY for day to day activities. During the winter I wear the Sorels to work and then keep a pair of tennis shoes in my office to change into once I get there. No need for that any more. Driving is nicer too. Have you ever tried to drive a vehicle with giant winter boots on? Not fun."
197532,1,"I was very pleased to get these shoes, they're very iconic no matter where you go and look great with just about any casual outfit. But after about 10 months of having these, rips between the rubber parts of the shoe and the cloth began to seperate. I'm not sure whether this is due to how my feet fit within the shoe. After trying to fix the seams myself, the shoes soon began to just fall apart really and just became really unwearable. If they were cheaper I would consider getting a second pair and maybe another different pair of shoes along with them. Overall they're still nice shoes, but they may need to be pampered somewhat for them to last a long time."
11186,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
79233,1,Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Plaid Hi SneakerGreat shoes at a great price! My daughter loves them :)
279772,1,This is defenitely one great pair of boots! It's very soft and comfortable. I recommed to use it with long socks.
300595,1,After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for. thanks again!!
85154,1,"These were the original Keen sandals and the first pair of Keens I ever bought. I think the Keen line has surpassed this sandal now.1) Looks. Copied by a dozen other copy cats now, but they were the originals! They had this funky look to them, which was basically a shoe with a lot of holes cut into it and gave it a very tough look, a very macho sandal. Quite stylish and still very striking, only time will tell if this look has legs.2) Design. A very good design and a very good idea: leather sandals with a very thick and strong sole. Nice drawstrings instead of laces or velcro.3) Comfort and function. This is where I think the new Keens surpass this one most. I wore this casually for the longest time and I was the first to be surprised when I found them tiring for long hikes. A supportive hiking shoe was what they were advertised for, right? But I found the sole to be unforgiving (not enough support) and the leather sandal too heavy. I've never worn them for hikes since then. Other complaints I've heard around the web include: hard to dry out when wet, should not really be used as an aquasock; and things like sand, cone needles and other things get in them when walking in the woods and beaches.So to summarize, this was a great new design, but I think best to be worn casually. Looks >> function for this first Keen, but I still like them very much. My Newports are over 2 years old now (or more), but they are still in very good shape."
152741,1,I have to say these are one of my favorite brands ever. in fact i now own 12 pairs of ugg boots they really are comfortable whether you wear them as slippers or for everyday. but i have to warn you because of the flat sole they are not that great for walking long distances unless you put in an insole. i have to say my favorite ones i own are the classic tall lavender the classic tall patchwork and the sunset in teal. definitely worth the money because they last long my oldest pair is over 5 years old and going strong.
261778,1,"In nostalgic moment, I decided I needed some Chucks. As a teen I wanted red ones but never got any, so now at 55, I said what the heck. They are as lightweight and comfortable as I remember. A great buy."
293967,1,"I knew I'd made the right choice the minute I put them on. They feel like shoes made by craftsmen. Within seconds I was climbing higher on the boulder than I wanted to go-- that's how much difference they made (o.k-- I'm comparing them to climbing in running shoes!) The other point worth making is that my feet stayed comfortable while climbing.Maybe the most telling comment I can make is this one. I ran into another climber with the same shoes. When I asked him if he liked them, his face lit up. And then all the other climbers (all wearing other brands) joined in the conversation-- everyone agreed that La Sportiva Mythos was the best."
370867,1,If you are reading this review you probably already own a pair of Chucks. I love the look and feel of the Lo Top ones. They look great and feel great.
103229,1,Purchased for dance class for two daughters. They do run small so exchanged sizes for one pair. Nice fit and look.
194730,2,"These have to be sent back,I'm very disappointed,I ordered extra wide,but they are super narrow...I wonder if it's the brand?,this is the second pair of extra wide Propet brand shoes I've bought and I've found them both to be very narrow......I'm sure it's not me...I've got other shoes from a differant brand...same size,and they are excellent.....won't be ordering Propet any more!"
325442,0,"i've been looking for mary jane's for a while and decided that i'd give these a try since they were so reasonably priced. they also come in wide sizes, and that's a plus. i just received them and i have yet to wear them. i did try them on. while they are super cute, they are also really big. my feet get wider the closer you get to my toes, so my feet are sort of like...ducks feet?! lol. anyway, i imagine these would be comfortable enough for people that have the longer second toe. my second toe is much shorter than my big toe, that combined with the duck-like shape of my feet, causes these shoes to be a bit uncomfortable. the way the toe area is designed it leaves a huge gap between my smaller toes and the end of the shoe, and presses my big toe into my other toes.i realize that the shape of my feet are not the norm, but i know a few other people with similar problems and i thought i'd point these things out. to be make it clear...the toe area has it's longest point in front of where the second toe would be. anyone with a wide width across their toes might find these uncomfortable.they are also a lot bigger than i expected. i usually wear a regular 9 1/2 and these wide width 9's feel a lot more like a 10 or a 10 1/2 to me.they are cute though."
180407,1,"Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10, 20, 30 years ago, except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support, comfort etc. They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still, 5 stars from my view. They are what they are supposed to be."
307391,1,"I'm a flip-flop and sandal lover. When I need to wear real shoes and socks, I grab these. They are comfy."
278828,1,"These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version."
287876,1,"These shoes look good and feel good. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because the shoes run a half-size big (but this seems to be true of all White Mountain shoes), and the color is more camel than rust. Still, a very nice pair of shoes."
269959,1,My Rockport Prowalker shoes from Amazon came as expected and hopefully I have the lifetime to walk them out. Normally the last for at least five years before you feel like getting another pair. Thank you Amazon for your service.
243116,0,"I bought these around New Years, and by June, the sole was already breaking apart and the back of the heel was deteriorating. I stopped wearing them regularly and they eventually wore down further and got few holes in the canvas right above the sole. I was expecting a little higher quality unfortunately. :\"
232582,1,I play 200+ softball games a year and I will go through 1-2 pairs of cleats in a year. These have lasted one year and are going into their second. For the price and quality I will keep getting these until they are discontinued. Solid look too.
332559,1,"Shoes are very comfortable and well made. The leather used are of good quality and for the price, you can't go wrong. Will order again"
371432,1,"I purchased the shoes for comfortable walking. The are indeed comfortable. Two unexpected issues I encountered were the shoes are VERY warm which is great outdoors in cold weather but rather inconvenient indoors and they are far uglier in real life than I expected, I find myself wearing very long pants to keep them hidden."
171168,0,"Let me first say that I like the looks of this shoe and it was very comfortable to wear but I didn't like the way it ""flip flopped"" when I walked in it. I've never worn mules before but I take it they're not supposed to do that? I ordered in my usual size and it didn't feel too large but it just wouldn't stay on the back of my foot. I thought about exchanging it for a smaller size or maybe not a wide width but maybe my issues with this mule make it best for me to actually try it on in stores first."
42081,1,"I bought the green shoe. First, it's really good but I mainly run on the hard concrete so it probably wasn't the shoe for me.I can't tell you how well it works off road, but on the road, my knees take a beating due to the lack of padding. These shoes definitely weren't designed for distances of over two miles on the road. Right now, I mainly use them for sprint workouts which they excell at. They are very flexible and lightweight so it's almost like running barefoot and is excellent training for calf muscles.I haven't got a chance to use the spikes but without the spikes, they have traction on snow and ice due to the metal on the bottom."
381193,1,this is my second pair of the same pair of shoes. They are very comfortable and lasted for an extremely long time. They are pretty good lookin too! Once I grow out of this pair I'll probably get another pair of sambas!
62133,1,My wife said she wasn't able to find Keds anymore so I looked on Amazon and there they were. Got a pair and they were just like the ones she had thought were discontinued. THe frist pair we got had a smudge on the heel. Amazon made the return easy and new pair arrived in a day. They were perfect! My wife is happy being able to find the Keds and I am happy with Amazon's great service.
320474,1,"It's a great ballet shoe, nice leather and sole piece--seem well made. Unfortunately I thought street shoe size would work for this also. It didn't. I had to send it back and get another size up. You might want to get a size larger too..but great for the price!"
117822,1,Very comfortable. I use them under my GPS watch when I run. Durability seems pretty good and have stayed white thus far. Nothing cheap about them.
254708,1,"I purchased these boots for my 23 year old son for Christmas. They came quickly, and fit him perfectly. He's been wearing them everyday and says they were comfortable from the first time he put them on. This was a great present!"
15966,1,I buy my son black chucks every year. They are classic and cool and the price can't be beat. They run large so make sure you size down 1/2 size to a full size. They do not come in half sizes so my son who is a size 13 wears a 12 and they fit great.
330265,1,"My husband FINALLY gave in and let me order a new pair of this Rockport nubuck that he has worn for more than 10 years! The styling is just familiar enough to keep him happy and updated enough to keep him in style. And, as always... unquestionable Rockport comfort and quality construction."
262493,0,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
274669,1,Great boots. Quick response. Will be ordering more. I have been wearing this product for many years and love them.
26613,0,"If you're looking for a quick shoe shine without lots of arm spinning, this is for you. The 4 AA batteries provide adequate power, but I was able to slow the motor down by pressing hard into the shoe. The shine cans had dried up in my set, so I'll have to use my own shine. Brushes and pads are color coded which is handy. The set could use carry or storage case, as packaging is a cardboard box with thin plastic insert that won't last long term. Set will put a good shine on shoes but doesn't measure up to the professional floor buffer."
19565,1,I brought this for my Mother. She loves the shoes. This is the only place I could get them. Her Christmas was made by receiving this product.
9447,0,I was under the impression that these shoes had wheels on them since they are called skate shoes. Wrong!! They are regular sneakers. They are really cute and look nice but don't buy them if you think that they are skate shoes.
174014,1,"I purchased these shoes for a recent cruise trip that included an excursion to Dunn's River Falls. The shoes are very comfortable. I had no problem maintaining a firm grip during our climb up Dunn's River Falls. The only problem I had was some slight slippage of the shoe liner. I additionally wore these shoes to the beach in Grand Cayman and found them to be quiet comfortable and slip free. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking to do the Dunn's River Falls trip. Note that I have only worn these twice so I cannot comment on how well they hold up over time yet. Essentially, these shoes more than met the task I had purchased them for."
125400,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
161730,1,the money clip that i just purchased is a high quality product. i would highly recomend this product and this company.
28054,1,"I am very satisfied with the shoes, I have 2 pairs."
354985,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
17402,1,"I LOVE THESE VANS! they look so sick and skate well, though not very durable considering the canvas.but packaging was great and was delivered sooner then expected ordered it monday and got it thurday.Great service awesome shoe"
376664,1,"I love the Gentle Souls brand -- have a pair of their boots that I live in in winter. So when I was looking for a summer sandal, I was delighted to find these. The style reminded me of a more expensive Donald J Pliner sandal I have lusted after for several years, a classic one-strap leather slide that goes with everything, but with the cute detailing on the side. I ordered a size 7, which is what I normally wear, but it was way too big. Returned it for a 6.5 (vastly relieved to find it was available in half sizes, which many upscale sandals are not these days) and they seemed to fit perfectly. I wore them only a few times before I went on a trip where I ended up doing a LOT of walking through airports, and I soon found that a blister had formed on the top of both feet where the strap had rubbed. Now, I do have a high instep, and that could be the reason this happened, so I won't blame the shoes entirely, but it is still a great disappointment to spend this much money on sandals and discover a problem too late in the game to return them. Just giving fair warning to anyone else who has a high instep."
164998,0,"This shoe is okay, but not quite as comfortable as my Medley style or the AP1 style."
375301,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had.

44029,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
370956,1,Great purchase. The only place we could find these shoes in the right color. Fast and quick.
227757,1,"I had the experience of having to exchange these shoes. It was fairly simple and I had no issues. I ordered them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They arrived fairly quickly in the mail. Though we ordered her normal size, they were about 1/2 size too large. So I followed the online instructions and sent them back for an exchange. I received a replacement in just a little over a week. I was impressed with the quick turnaround. The only drawback is that I had to pay to ship them back and also include a check for $7.99 to cover shipping of the new shoes."
311753,1,"Very pleased with tem, easy waling, fits perfectly and also very easy and nice to dance in, My one word would be: &#34;NICE&#34;"
381393,1,"I was going crazy looking for a leather soled shoe that would fit. This shoe does run small. I ordered a half a size bigger and I can manage with that, but I think I could have ordered a full size bigger and it would have been a little better. Also, I do have wide feet so I ordered the wide width that was available. I'd say the width runs true. The foot strap secures with a buckle and not that loathsome velcro, that never stays closed.I would recommend this product, with the size adjustment caveat. I have flat feet so the arch support seams light moderate to me. The heel has good depth and the toe box is comfortable for my wide foot."
384436,2,"I purchased these shoes because they came wide, and I have a wide forefoot and bunions. Unfortunately, the heels on these shoes are as wide as the front of the shoe, and I could not lace them up enough to keep the heels from slipping. I have never seen such a wide heel on any shoe. Why do shoe makers assume your entire foot is wide? These shoes might work for someone with swollen feet or a very wide foot all over, but they did not fit me at all in the heel. They are not as clunky as many wide shoes, and the leather was soft. I am returning the shoes, and continuing my quest for a wide, decent-looking shoe with a normal heel width."
232879,1,I recently purchased a pair of the Reebok DMX Walking shoes while on vacation in nothern California. I have a pair of New Balance 842 Walking shoes that I normally use but I left them at home. The Reebok DMX Max Walking shoes have been a pleasant surprise. They are comfortable and have the feeling of walking on air. They were also about half the price of my New Balance 842s. I did considerable walking while in northern California up and down hills and on flat land and my legs really never got tired. I now use them at home over my New Balance 842s. I normally walk 3 1/2 to 5 miles a day.
293498,1,"I just purchased my 5th pair of Propet Breeze Walkers. I have some severe foot problems post botched bunion surgery, and these sandals are the only shoes that are comfortable all day long for me. The arch is very good and the adjustable straps allow you to adjust to meet your foot needs. Love them."
141435,1,These sandals are very comfortable. They are well made and sizes run very true from one style to another. They get even comfier with age and use....Love them!
355168,1,"This purchase was another gift for Christmas. I bought this particular pair of shoes for my wife. Although it was not a direct Amazon.com purchase and I was redirected to another site, the process was easy. The shoes were shipped fast and on time, there was great communication from the site that sold them. Another great purchase!"
354292,1,These seem to go with everything. The decorative stitching on the lower part of the shoe really add a touch of style and the heel is just perfect. Very comfortable shoes.
282493,1,"i agree with the other reviewers. - i bought 2 pairs of these, and find them comfy, - tho i will have to wear my Orthotics just to give myself that little bit of lift that these lack -"
4728,1,"I have worn these boots for over 20 years and my brother a little over 25 years. We both would not be caught dead with out them. While they do wear down - eventually - they are always reliable. One pair last me through 3 cruises and I was still able to make them inspection ready.Right now I have the same Corcoran jump boots on that I have been wearing for 3 years, and except for some slight scuffing they still shine up better than most of the dress shoes men wear in the office. And I wear them everywhere work, church, out on the town, down by the lake, fixing the car, it does not matter, just hose off the dirt slap some polish on them and your ready to go. Polish and a little elbow grease is a lot cheaper than a new pair of shoes.While having shoes that look nice can be important. I like knowing that I have a pair of boots/shoes on that can take just about anything I can throw at them. And these fit that bill, in spades.The only down side is after several years of continuous wear the sole may separate, especially around the heel. (The top half of the sole is sewn to the boot the heel is not) But, don't worry, use a liberal amount of super glue and your back in business.If your on the fence because of cost. Just pick them up in the end you will save money considering that these boots stay wearable for so long."
61636,1,The Keds are fine. I have had them for a few days now and they are great. No complaints at all.
231165,2,"WTF is with a 2 week break in period? I guess once they stop torturing you the relief must make them feel that much more comfortable. I have worn these for a day at a time, a total of ten days, over the past year. They still are abrasive and tight and I am throwing them away. My Reefs have lasted me 2 years running, were comfortable out of the box, and are still comfortable."
89577,1,"Cute, comfortable shoe at a great price! The bronze color is perfect with almost any color, and the style is exactly what I wanted for anything from jeans to skirts to shorts. Would definitely buy again."
11610,1,"I have had these boots for about 2 years, I have hiked through the woods, dug 4' deep ditches in hard clay, and I take several motorcycle trips every year. I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape. After all this I just polished them with kiwi parade gloss shoe polish to a mirror finish that would make your drill instructor proud (not an exaggeration they do take a good polish). Before I got these boots I went through about two pair of shoes a year, these boots are so tough that they will easily last for another 2 years. I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years, and for the price cannot be beat. I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off, they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use."
370763,1,"I have been wearing all stars for way to long now, and these are just as good as I remember. These shoes are iconic, we all know how good these are, the oxfords are a great change of pace from my high tops. These shoes will never go out style!"
185435,1,"These were my first converse, and I was a bit hesitant to buy a pair online, so I went to Khols and tried on a pair there to find the correct size. I bought the Black Monochrome, and they are stylish and comfortable. And look great! I have had several compliments on them in the first week or so. A great buy!"
107321,1,My three pairs of SAS shoes arrived this afternoon 2/9/11. I am happy with the speedy service and quality of product. I will order from Papa Shoes the next time I need SAS shoes.
2320,1,"My husband likes these boots. They are comfy and wear well. He just ordered two pair, one for work and one to wear out casually.We priced shopped and they were cheaper here than another shoe store we order from on line."
131132,1,"The only problem I have,is that the overshoe is just a little to wide.Otherwise,it'll save my regular shoes from water damage."
345747,1,An Excelent choice. They are very good for everyday use. Accesible price. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
188446,1,"I bought these for my dad and he loves them. Comfortable, name brand, and a good price! Cant beat that!"
35337,0,NICE SHOES FIT WELL HARD TO PUT ON OPENING IS SMALL TO GET YOUR FOOT IN ... DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE A HIGH INSTEP
176782,1,We bought these shoes for my 85 year old mother. She really likes them alot. And they look nice with her outfits she wears. They help her to be more stable on her feet and not trip. They also protect her feet from rocks and dirt.
129761,0,"I'll start by saying I was going to buy solid black Teva Mush, of which I already have 3 different color pairs, so they could go with anything. Then I saw these were a little cheaper on sale & decided to try them. So probably my review is not glowing only because it's based on comparing with Mush. I am size 5 & narrow and these are just a bit looser than Mush, although the straps(? term escapes me) seem elasticated and are wider, I think Mush ones are fatter by enough to make the difference for me. The sole of these is a bit thicker and not quite as springy as mush but actually does feel more supportive with a higher arch. To me the fit is a bit loose and for that reason I expect they will not be quite as comfortable for intensive walking as Mush, for me. I may relegate these as round the house shoes & get - you guessed it, a solid-color pair of Mush. Having said that if you are not already familiar with those, and do not have tiny feet like me, you will probably think these are just wonderful!!"
106215,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
15429,1,I can summerise it with this ..... It was a wonderful purchased .... It felt good wearing it ... I fully recommend it for anyone who wants luxury shoes .
371618,1,"I love these sandals! They're super comfortable ... they conform nicely to the shape of your feet, and I've had none of the blisters that one normally gets breaking in new sandals. The contoured footbeds are remarkably soft and easy on your feet, as well. Be sure to order one size larger than usually needed, though - these run small."
313171,1,"I've been having dealing with plantar fasciitis for 9 months and after buying MANY different brands and types of shoes and inserts, I found this lives up it's claim help with food stress and fatigue. I've paid twice the amount of money for 'top of the line&#34; running shoes and found they don't come close to level of reduction of foot stress that this shoes provides . I've been wearing these shoes for about a month now and don't plan going back to my &#34;fancy running shoes&#34; anytime soon"
166497,1,"My 1st set of Danners, well worth the price. I wore them for 3 years solid. Now I'm going to have Danner resole them. Comfortable out of the box. Some brown shoe polish and they still look great. With the exception that I wore the treads off. High quality leather.the fact that the Danner boots last so long, makes them worth every penny. I don't want to buying new boots every 6 months. I want to resole them after 3 years great service. Best boots I ever put on, like a second skin.Regards.Helmut"
134202,1,"PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE MORE THAT EXPECTED AND IS VERY NICE FOR BASKETBALL WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED, FITS MY ANKLE SO GREAT LET ME JUMP HIGHER KNOWING THAT MY ANKLE IS SUPPORTED."
232613,1,"It was a wonderful surprise when I received my very first online purchase. Not only did I received it in a timely manner, the shoe fits perfectly, is comfortable, warm and the construction is excellent. I have recommended this shoe to several friends."
370732,1,Having a wide foot they fit a little on the narrow side - I kept them knowing that canvas will probably stretch without to much problem. Also my shoes make a slight hollow sound from one of the baby toe tips; I'm assuming with time that too will abate.
70042,1,"Comfortable, warm, and dry. You really don't want to take these off. Tread freely through anything with confidence, and great traction. Awesome value."
292722,1,"The shoes arrived in perfect condition, true to size (10.5) fabulous bright red color, not a problem at all. Would definitley do business with the seller again. Thank you!"
175359,1,"Naturalizer Scout ShoesI have been looking for another pair of these shoes for years now. Not carried in our local stores. I didn't know they still made them. I had two pairs which I wore until they wore out. I will be ordering more, so keep them stocked. I hope they keep making them! I have feet that are very hard to fit, so that the Velcro strap helps. So does the design and comfortable heels. But I mustn't praise them too much or you'll be all sold out next time I want to buy a pair."
230977,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
148109,1,"I just got these in pewter and they are the most comfortable pair of pumps I have ever worn. They are true to size, slide on and fit like a glove. I want another pair. Get this shoe, it looks so hot with a pair of skinny jeans."
212809,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
4599,1,"When I saw these shoes at the store, the sales guy told me Runner's World voted them #1. I looked at him suspiciously and thought, ""Reebok makes a good *running* shoe!?"" He saw my face and said, ""I know, even the RW article said 'we can't believe we're saying this, but...'"" So, I tried them on and they fit wonderfully!Although I have fairly wide feet, there isn't any tightness and the heel holds well. Decent stability, good cushioning.... I like that the arch allows your foot to flex (unlike most stability shoes out there these days - the ones with the rigid arch that lays flat on the road). I also have a flat foot and over-pronate; I wear my orthotics in the shoes and still take my regular size.So far, my longest run in these shoes has been about 45 minutes or 5.5 miles. I've worn them about 5 times. I'll update the review if I find anything wrong.Oh - I bought these shoes for $59 at Sports Basement in San Francisco. They were such a great price I bought two pair. But mine are blue, not that nice gray color ;-)"
22586,1,"I ordered two pair of Crocs for my two grand daughters. Crocs are Crocs--but why were they sent in two shipments, charging me the minimum shipping charge twice?"
33421,1,My husband liked this work shoe so much I ordered another pair to have on hand when he needs them! He's on concrete all day 7 days a week and shoe comfort and support are a must
254137,1,I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these.
329808,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
165714,0,"These boots are nice- They look sharp (the color is really closer to Oxblood, not clown red as the picture might appear), and have a very comfortable sole. That said, there are some things to consider-*In case you dont know, Dr. Martens shoe sizing runs a little big. If you wear between a 12.5 and 13, go for the UK 11. This is contrary to what is suggested by Amazon (half sizes use next higher size). Width was generous (I have a wide foot, and these seemed to fit fine.)*Calf fit may be a problem. I have 19.5"" calves, and there was no way I could get the boots closed. As a result I had to return the boots. :(*These boots are not the UK made docs. Some people like the UK ones better, others don't care.*Remember boots take some breaking in time- This is true of all boots. They should not be uncomfortable when you first get them, but they will feel better after a couple months of wear."
320626,0,"I usually wear a 7.5 but in this slipper I need an 8.5. I have slim feet, so even after I pulled the elastic strings as far as they could go, the slipper was still loose around the edges. I was hoping for a comfy slipper, instead I got an ill-fitting mess! I returned them. They might work for some, but they just weren't for me."
298140,0,"ProsI like the style of the shoes. They look good with jeans and casual wear. I really like the darker brown leather on the back. It gives a pretty cool look on that portion of the shoe.ConsThey aren't as comfortable as I had hoped. There is virtually no arch support. The soles are pretty flat and do not provide really any sense of cushioning. If you like a feel of being in touch with the ground and not very cushy soles, you will like these. I read several reviews stating that these were the most comfortable shoes ever, etc. I certainly cannot agree with that. They can be a little difficult to get on and for me, they tend to wear (rub) on my heel. Of course I have only worn them a few times at this point, so I'm hoping that they will break in and be better. Also, I'm very glad that I read other reviews because several folks commented that the sizing runs a bit large. I agree. I normally wear 13 and I bought 12. With the size 12, I have plenty of room. This is not an issue, just something that anyone buying online needs to know.OverallThey are just ok. I really wanted to love them, but I haven't gotten there yet. These will probably be shoes that I wear because I like the look much more than because I like the feel.I hope this helps you in your decision to purchase."
247806,0,"These shoes took a time warp out of the 80's. Since i like and dislike some stuff about the 80's mainly the clothing i gave this 3 stars.If you want to look ahead of the game in style in Germany, which is stuck in the 80's, buy these shoes and be adored buy the germans. (i just went to germany and the majority of the country is stuck in the 80's and just beginning 90's styles)"
131416,1,"Very comfortable, holding up well so far. Only complaint is that the ""silver"" is quite sparkly...I wasn't expecting that."
19186,1,These shoes are very narrow so it is important that you as the consumer buy a whole size bigger if you are interested. Other wise they are comfortable and stylish.
217165,1,You've seen these shoes everywhere...right? Well theres a reason for it! They are SO comfortable and virtually go with ANY outfit! I love them and wear them everyday! :) BUY THESE SHOES and you won't regret it (unless YOU order the wrong size!)
170813,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
297114,0,"Low stars because I never got to them try out. Bought the desert boot ankle high a little before. Oxford length was ok, but wrap around top of foot was way tight. Might try a 1/2 size larger on these. The desert boot ran a full size below just like another reviewer mentioned. I'd go 1/2 size below normal size on the oxford."
351006,1,"I spent 11 years in the British Army followed by 14 years in law enforcement.I have tried all kinds of boot from supposed ""tactical"" boots which turn out to be crap, to GP boots. Lace up, side zips and everything in between. Generally (with a few exeptions) I was disapointed. Before the Fort Lewis I had 2 pairs of Danner. a GTX Cordura sided pair (briliant) and a leather side zip pair (not so great but OK). I was a fan but they wore out in the sole quite quickly.I eventually bought the Danner Fort Lewis after seeing them on Amazon for half the price of my on-line gear shop . Initially I was disapointed, VERY disapointed. They are a narrow fit and I have broad feet. You can feel the toe box lining and it rubs. They are heavy. They feel like a couple of dumpsters on your feet. I was not a happy boy. It's a good thing that I didn't pay over $700 that the on line criminals were asking.Then... After walking through a river for an hour at work (feet remained dry so the goretex works), I took them off and oiled them up and dried them. Since then I have 10"" hi top sneakers. Fantastic. I wear mine every work day and love them. I can not reccomend them highly enough. Be prepared to break them in for a while or rub them with hot melted leather dressing and leave them in the sun for a day..The only customising that I have done is to remove the factory inner sole and put in an orthitic.Dave"
259123,1,"Very nice shoe, very functional I owned a pair about 15 years back and found these to be nearly identical. Ionic Pillars (Waffles) work and cushion your foot very effectively. Grid, Gel, Air, etc cushioning work just as well and better in many cases but these are indeed a well cushioned shoe. If you don't mind the retro look then get a pair cause the price is right."
293701,1,"Very comfortable and warm, but seems to run small. I usually wear a 9 1/2 shoe, and bought size 10 which just barely fits. I had others try them on who also wear around that same size cause I accidentally clicked twice and ordered two pairs. Everyone else tried them and said they are too small for them. So, I'd buy a size or so bigger when you order. Otherwise, they're great."
105274,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
98691,0,"Bought for my daughter for Christams. She wears a 6.5, I bought a 7. It was too small. Not a fan of having to return internet purchases."
376380,1,These shoes are the best walking shoe. The quality is excellent and always the same. Highly recommend these shoes. An added bonus is the fact that these shoes are quite water proof.
33404,1,Just as I ordered. Work perfectly for his practice games. Size wasaccurate. After washing still comfortable.I would recommend to anyone.
200210,1,"My Sahara pair of Top-Sider Sperry's was the product of a last minute request by the groom for a wedding I was in. I had never owned a pair before and was still grumbling about the unexpected cost when I first slipped my feet in them. Even when they weren't broken in yet I was impressed with how comfortable they were. It timed out well with my summer hours and dress code for work. Within 2-3 weeks, I hardly knew they were on my feet. Like any shoe, they took a little time to break in properly, but unlike other shoes I wasn't developing blisters or taking out sore feet after a full work day of wearing them.They're a pretty versatile shoe for the summer. I've worn them with a linen suit, linen pants, jeans, shorts, bathing suit, etc. to work, the beach, the lake, around town, out to dinner, and everything in-between. I don't own a boat - I can barely afford these shoes, but I don't regret buying them one bit and I have no doubt they'll hold up and keep my feet comfortable for a good long while!"
213508,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
272462,0,"Really comfortable soles, the front bands around the toes are a little tight on wider feet but seem to be breaking in okay. The pinky toe gets rubbed the most but not so bad as to form a blister or anything. They felt funny to walk in at first but have gotten easier with use. Nice, cheap sandal though far from perfect."
41886,1,"Found these at Sears several years ago and have not looked back. I've gone from a 9-1/2 to a ten for better comfort and I've tried to find a different brand but these keep working for me. They last about four months - the laces and the bottoms wear out at about the same time.Usually buy two pair at a time if available and will be very bummed if they are ever discontinued. I wear them at work, for play and hiking.I wish they would last longer and it was easier to clean the dog poo from the lugs (we have dogs)."
70523,1,"Bubble Laces. They hold the knot...what more is there? Not having to tie shoes over and over, ingenious. More colors please."
173503,2,I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out..however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off..very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
299734,1,"These are super comfy shoes. This is my first pair of Birks, and they will not be my last, for sure! In my hot climate, they offer great comfort with no sweat build up on the insole. Grippy soles work well on all surfaces, but still soft enough for wooden floors. Only minus for me if how dirty the inside can get very quickly."
55695,1,"These cute, white Keds are perfect with so many outfits. Their slender sillouette adds a feminine touch to jeans, shorts, capris and summer skirts. They are comfortable for walking around town and give a much simpler profile than most sneakers these days."
98838,1,"These are great shoes! Very comfortable. I normally wear a 7.5 and the 7.5 fits me fine, so I don't know about the 1/2 size problem that some of the other reviews suggested. When I first put them on, they were a little bit tight across my foot, but since they are real leather, by the time the day was over, there fit perfectly. Heel is real wood, but they are not as heavy as I thought they would be. They're my second pair of MIAs and both are awesome comfortable!"
27529,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
218455,1,"Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
61690,0,"I purchased a white pair of Keds tennis shoes recently. When they arrived, they looked wonderful and fit like a glove...I just loved them! After a week or so, they needed washed, so I put them in the washing machine with a load of whites and used cold water and a name brand laundry detergent. Imagine my surprise when I removed them from the washer to air dry, and discovered they were now a light blue color! Evidently the dark, royal blue foot liner 'bleeds'. It looks like I have a blue pair of Keds tennis shoes now..."
341037,1,"This is my second pair of CAT Second shift boots.I wore the first pair out after years of abuse.They are comfortable from day one, look great and last."
240338,1,"They are the one pair of shoes you can't go wrong with. Wear them with shorts or jeans, always looks great!"
170838,1,"Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals. I'm getting a dressy ""Metro"" pair in black to wear at work.As for the shrinkage issue, one thing I've noticed is that my old Crocs are much softer and more pliable than new pairs I less frequently wear, and my theory is that they soften up with regular use (perhaps they harden/shrink with heat/disuse)."
32700,1,"very pleased with these, they are very comfortable to wear, and have rubber soles so can wear them outdoors, are very good option for wearing around the house. are wellmade, much better than I expected for the price, will be ordering more of these, very handy to have around. I love how can throw them in the washer to clean, too."
240560,1,I was needing these shoes in a hurry and I wasn't disappointed. Thanks for the great service and the condition of the package when it arrived was excellent.
109772,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
152197,0,"I am somewhat disappointed in the product because I find that they don't provide the arch support I was hoping for. My feet, with high arches, tend to cramp in these sandals, and I find them a bit of a pain to put on because the back has to be mightily tugged on. Otherwise, a good product. Given the relatively high price, I would not purchase them again."
214065,1,"I'm always looking for slippers to wear around the house that keep my feet and ankles warm (and protect me a little from the toy cars and legos on the floor) these do the job and make it look good!! Love the color, the button style is cute and these bad boys keep my bare feet WARM!!!! Not sweaty warm, just toasty."
330118,1,These shoes are cute and comfortable. They shipped in a timely manner and are just what I expected! Thanks!
339015,1,I have had the chucks for about a month now and there holding up well. I like the look of them there comfortable and simple ill be wearing them for a long time! :) If you are thinking of buying some chuck T's i would there pretty cheap and they can withstand some wear amd tear! Five stars
159790,1,"It was here in no time, we appreciate the speedyness especially when your little daughter is expecting it, it came the day it was suppose to.... maybe one day earlier. Thanks!"
328869,2,Great wearing boot right out of the box. Super light and perfect for warm weather EXCEPT as pointed out by another owner the sole delaminates from boot.They tore up like a lousy retread tire. Only glued together and poorly at that. I expect more from Browning. Do NOT buy these
135000,1,"The boots were ordered from Amazon and are of very good quality. The only problem my husband had was they seemed to run just a little snug. After wearing them a few times, they seemed to stretch just a little. He loves the boots and believes they will last a long time."
237796,1,"Great product at very good price, very comfortable fit.First time buyer of this brand but will not be the last"
339537,1,"Was very thankful these arrived so soon after ordering,was a last minute item...and my daughter loves them....she now has 2 pairs..and is planning on collecting them for different colors....Thank youShelia Sale/VA"
176259,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
139304,1,These little pumps are exactly what I expected to receive. They look simple and neat. I had to stretch the right one a bit as my right foot is wider than my left. I would definitely recommend them.
285904,1,"I just love my new boots! They arrived promptly and I've been wearing them almost every day since I received them. They are so comfortable and warm, not to mention they look great with jeans. So glad that I made this purchase!"
63950,1,"This is the only way to shop!! The shoes were great, they fit, and we had them in a couple of days!! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds. We had them so quick-I was shocked!!! Thanks Amazon!!"
259061,1,"I've always been sceptical when buying any clothing and footwear online. I've always wanted a pair of Chuck's. Got these, tried them on and I love them!"
253617,1,I liked the flat enzo shoes. These are very comfortable.I have been wearing these shoes for quite some time.I would recommend these shoes to my family and friends.
262082,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
89442,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
145030,1,"I bought these tall Uggs for my 20 year old grandaughter. She is a student in Theater and is on her feet most of the day, singing, dancing, and acting. She wanted these because people told her how comfortable they were. After she wore them all day on Christmas, she declared she just might sleep in them. It is now nearly a month later and she still thinks they are just what she needed."
73890,1,"Bought a pair of cheaper knock offs that gave my 21 month old daughter blisters in a very short time. These shoes are fantastic! They fit perfectly (bought the 6/7 for her, she is a 6.5 in other shoes). I will definately be purchasing more of them. The bright pink looks awesome--better than in the pics."
215058,0,Was disappointed with zipper. Hard to get up and slipped after wearing for 20 min and snow came in the boot. Usually likeSorels but this one does not live up to their reputation.
258344,1,I bought these sandals for a 2 week vacation in Hawaii. I wore them everyday; even while hiking on volcanic rocks and in the ocean. They are very comfortable and held up very well.
44585,1,I actually bought these shoes for work because I love the style. They are probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn!!! And they are gorgeous!!
59498,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
372776,1,"My fiance wanted some new converse shoes for his birthday, so I searched the internet for awhile trying to find the best deal, this was definitely it! It was the best price paired with free shipping, and they came within a week, so that was great! They've also held up very well, and he loves them, so they get quite a bit of use!"
322048,1,These were for my daughter's beginning ballet class. They get the job done at a very reasonable price. No complaints here.
149286,0,"I ordered a whole size larger than I wear and these are much too tight for my feet. They are not only narrow but they also are small in length. I am returning them. I wish they would have fit, they are made well and look very nice."
8187,1,"I ordered these shoes, the price was great!!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience."
213890,1,"I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens, but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price. They are lightweight and comfortable, and look very nice in solid black. The best thing about them is their durability. I am tough as hell on shoes in general, but these are very scuff resistant. I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair, but we'll see."
52284,1,"I never thought I would find something like this especially in time for Christmas, thank you so much- they are awesome looking and the recipient will absolutely LOVE them as a Christmas Gift. I will be a returning customer for life."
166000,0,"I was in search of a pair of riding boots that was both stylish and priced comfortably. I noticed riding boots can cost up to $300.00. I came across these shoes and what sold me was the price. I purchased the brown pair around Feb 2010, the color is so rich and the material is of good quality. I always get compliments every time I wear them, when I tell people the price they can't believe it. But there are downsides:1. Please do not wear these shoes in very cold weather,your toes will freeze,2. They are extremely slippery,I try to avoid walking downhill and so forth. I was forced to find a shoe repair shop and add rubber soles for an additional $30 bucks."
118057,1,She loved them - They were just like the shoes the real ballerinas wear. She put them on immediately and wore them all day. Nice leather bottoms.
41111,0,"usually reef products are a bit more comfortable than this, but they're okay. i basically just needed white flip flops to wear for dancing at my wedding reception. i couldn't find any at a store, especially since i like ones w/ fabric straps (not plastic). these fit the bill - they aren't anything special, but they get the job done."
363730,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
99099,1,"I love these converse so much. They run about 1/2 size too big, which is fine for me, but overall these are my favorite pair of shoes that I own."
63278,1,Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months. the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores. We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
329176,1,"I wore either Ft Lewis or Arcadia boots from Danner exclusively during my USMC career. Field, deployment, arctic warfare, mountain warfare leadership courses, part of SERE, ARC, everything.. Never failed, never let me down and always one of my most important pieces of gear. Post USMC it was my go to boot while with USG. Again, an important piece of gear that I put on and never needed to worry about.I am looking at a pair that I bought in 2002 and I wear them and my other pair on alternate days. Still hard use still dependable still a boot that has in my mind no equal. There are tons of fancy ""duty"" boots with their goofy looking soles and bizarre looks even Danner makes some.They are not half the boot. If you buy them take care of them and take advantage of Danner's refurbishment program and you'll never need To buy hard use boots again. I honestly think if I lost these I feel the loss.Don't even worry just buy these boots I promise you MAYBE .00005 percent of the population will put boots through what I and others put boots through."
230354,0,"This is a gorgeous, well made shoe -- if only they had fit my husband. I knew as soon as they arrived that this was the narrowist EEE I had ever seen. My husband couldn't even get his foot in them. I can't imagine what a regular width show would be like."
100766,0,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
348110,1,"I wore a brown pair for five years (business and casual). Very comfortable. Eventually, I put insoles in just before the recession. he soles fell apart from overuse. I now own a brown AND black pair and continue to wear everyday. Just sold 1.1M in autos at a 3 day tradeshow in Vegas wearing Clarks Escalades."
341189,1,"These shoes fit true to size for me. I have this same style in several colors, and this is my 3rd pair of the chocolate color over several years. Highly recommended for comfort. Not a lot of padding in the sole, but the leather upper molds to the foot well. Great casual shoe."
100329,1,"I am always a little sceptic about buying shoes online, but these fit great, are original, and look good! I strongly recommend them."
101719,1,"A very nice, soft pair of ballet slippers. My granddaughter loves them. The price was also very nice. Very pleased.."
42073,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
69593,1,"Size was small for me, but my daughter loved them!! They are comfortable, fresh on feet and great price. Delivered right on time."
242553,1,"I really like these shoes. I use them for weightlifting/running. My only warning is that they run quite big. I had to order 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually do, but they work fine. My first pair got torn up a lot around the lace-holes, but I think that was because they were too big. My current pair has no problems so far."
379105,1,"These shoes are great, they look just as pictured and the price I was able to get them at was unbeatable. Can't wait until my son wears them. (My son has wide feet (he's 2 and a half) and these look like they will fit him no problem at all!)"
286403,0,"I have ordered and worn these shoes for many years. This is my fourth pair. As with so many other things, the quality is not the same anymore. I have had both the black and the brown, and the brown seems to last longer than the black. On the black, the footbed is very soft and the fabric wears away more quickly. Also, the arch support is not as good on this pair as it has been in previous pairs I have bought.They are expensive shoes and I will keep them because they are great for Florida and are my go-to shoes all during warm weather (which is about 7 months); however, their value to cost is starting to deteriorate in my opinion."
247032,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
75077,1,"I love these sandals and have ordered them over the internet for many years. They are basically my favorite shoe and I order them in many colors. I fear that they are being phased out, as they are getting hard for me to find now."
120361,1,"I have long, skinny feet (like size 11 length and yet, size 9 slip-on). So, I was very nervous about ordering these online. But, when I slipped my sister's pair on, I was absolutley amazed at how squishy-comfy the soles were and she has had hers for a year! I decided to risk it. I am so glad! These olowahu flops have extra straps, more than a normal flip flop anyway, and I think that helps keep them on my feet....so tightly that they actually make the flip flop sound when I walk! Usually, I just get a slish, slide sound because I'm trying so hard just to keep them on.Plus, the stiches on the brown ones are gold and sparkly! I'm a girly-girl and LOVE this!! I've already gotten so many compliments on them!The best feature: the amazing soles. I have bad knees, I'm tall and my feet hurt after any amount of time spent on them. Being a mom of three young children, that happens daily!! So, I usually wear tennis shoes all day and at the end of the day when I ease my feet out of them, my toes are throbbing! But, now, I just slip my tevas on and wear them all day (even on walks) and not only do my feet look great, they never end up in pain! Thanks, Teva! Love these."
279294,1,"very good purchase for my daughter, she had a pair before and she wouldn't take them off unless she went to sleep so they worn out in almost 3 years, so i got this new pair for her for xmas, i'm sure she's gonna love them.perfect sizing and quality."
288850,1,"With the proper sizing of my foot by a podiatrist, I then logged on to Amazon, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed! My New Balance size 13 D shoes arrived well within my expectations.I knew I could count on Amazon!A very satisfied customer!"
242145,1,"Thanks for the service, is very good!The product buy is of good quality, y arrived in the estimated time, I'm very happy with the service ... Thanks! and"" Happy New Year 2012""Sincerely;Angel Clark.Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela."
260270,1,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
244226,1,"I get to keep my hands free and a mulitude of stuff in a bag on my hip instead of over my shoulder, works great."
243153,1,I absolutely love the style of Chucks but my one piece of advise is to wear thicker socks if you want comfort.
54381,1,"The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black. The Black and Navy are so similar in color, I really only needed to order the black. The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival."
161843,1,"I bought this converse for my younger sister that she badly wanted them. Transaction was very smooth, they got here on time, and she was really happy!"
319851,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
41692,1,I have been wearing these for years now. I like them a lot.Good traction on the soles. They also come with an extra setof laces...(black ones). Good all round shoe.
221516,1,"Got what I paid for, the description was accurate, and the toy is durable (it gets beat up on, and still looks great). I had been looking for this figurine, and was glad when I found it for a reasonable price"
371369,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
307479,1,Have worn Softspots in the past as a nursing shoe and found them to be very comfortable. This casual style is every bit as comfortable and true to size. The only drawback I could find is in the arch support. It could be a bit firmer.
233194,1,I own 6 pairs of these shoes in different colors. They are classic flats! I wear them to work and for both casual and semi-formal events. You simply cannot beat them for comfort and style!
374863,1,Love them! Very comfortable and nice quality. I can wear them with anything. I would definitely recommend them.
205173,1,"I've never been much of one for fancy shoes. Sure, I love the way they look, but I end up wearing them once, then stowing them to the ever-growing stash in the bottom of my closet.When I bought this shoe in the blushing bride/heather color last fall from a catalog, I expected another candidate for that stack in my closet. A shoe with the playful, sporty, yet somehow feminine details of this one simply isn't practical...right?Then they came and I tried them on.I hate to admit it, but I am now a Puma athletic shoe addict. Every pair is sporty and trendy, yet has a classical styling that is somehow sophisticated and traditional. They work for me because they're pracitcal enough to go running in, but stylish enough to wear with jeans or a sporty minidress.There's not much else to say. These are the most comfortable cute shoes I've ever had, plain and simple. They are, by far, the most versatile shoes I've ever owned. BUY THEM!"
80824,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
203837,1,Always true to size and comfortable. My favorite flip flop for everyday wear and I throw them in the washing machine whenever they need it.
139127,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
142578,1,I had a pair size the same as my shoes (13) and did not enjoy themWhen I got this pair (14-15) I use them every day and enjoy them a lot.crocs rock!
322519,1,Now first thing is first I am not a dancer... at all but I bought theses shoes because they where cute and I wanted something nice to wear around the house. Now I saw that people where complaining about how to shoe gapes around your foot. Well you know the string that is in the front? Untie those and pull them has hard as you can and BAM it gets tighter! I got annoyed for the same reason because I thought about taking the elastic off and moving it to the gaping hole but after the string became untied I tried that trick and now they are perfect. Another thing is I would suggest to order at least a half size smaller because personally I like shoes to be a bit snug but this is my thing. Just another note if you are in a dance class then its better to take the advice of your teacher V.S a review from amazon :)
49030,1,"This is my go-to walking shoe when sneakers just won't do. Just returned from walking at Belmont Lake State Park where I wore this Jocelyn shoe. Since I've purchased it, I've put it through its paces--from muddy trails in Maine to sidewalk rambles here on Long Island, and it has held up. Comfortable for sure. The material never seems to scuff, and simple clear gel polish keeps it shining. The heel hasn't shown any wear either. This is the second pair I've owned, and they last quite a long time. The only consession I've had to make was buying a cushioned insole product to ""beef up"" the cushioning which eventuals gets thin. It's true to size, but the extra wide width I bought had just enough toe room, not a lot of extra. I'd buy it again."
373943,1,"I no longer shop for shoes, I only shop for more Merrell Mocs.I can't rave on more than others about these fine shoes, so I won't add to their well-earned laudits.The satisfying fact is that Merrell is a division of a company called Wolverine, who is the parent or umbrella company of Hush Puppies and also makes construction boots and the boots for the U.S. Military."
142225,1,"These are great. They run true to size, nice color, and you can wear them all day and your feet still feel good. If they had other colors I would buy them all!"
225362,1,"Quick shipping, and no problems at all. They have all the colors so you can mix and match"
173885,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
219088,0,"These are so tough to get on, even after a few weeks of wear. My son is 7 and he has the hardest time getting into them. Once they're on, however, he says they feel great, and it's the usual Geox quality."
209473,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
186312,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
269749,1,"After one or two weeks of break in period,these rockport prowalkers are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had,bar none. This includes any top of the line running shoes I've had such as New Balance. Ecellent value and comfort! Can't beat it!"
193012,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
213246,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
20132,1,"This is why some brick-and-mortar retailers are dying. A local store gave me the wrong size, had to bring it back, then they were out of the right size. Walking out to the car, I fired up the iPhone app and pushed a button and then the right size ones appeared at my door two days later, thanks to Amazon.com."
158878,1,"These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose."
254844,1,"They are comfortable shoes, but they do run a full size and half large. My fiance normally wears a size 8.5 and we ordered a 7 and they fit perfect. They do not protect against the cold at all, in fact they make his feet colder in the snow, but they are great if you are just inside or staying out of cold temperatures."
71244,1,"I've served 2 tours in Afghanistan. What isn't sand/silt is rock. The interior soles are the most comfortable of any boot I've worn. The quality is outstanding and the quick-laces are the best since the old black boots ""back in the day"". Consistently comfortable and the amazing construction of the lower means I don't feel the rocks like so many others complain about with their ""light weight"" boots."
295085,1,This is not the first pair I purchased and have also bought them for friends and as gifts. I have a very steep and long driveway. I have fallen on it due to the winter ice and packed snow more than once. With YakTrax I can confidently travel up and down the pavement even on the worst conditions of snow and/or ice. I am sure they have saved me from a lot of burising and probably some broken bones. I can't say enough about how great they are. They have kept me from being a prisoner in my own home.
356139,1,"I bought my first pair of ""Berkies"" while in college many years ago. Wore them continuously and was able to purchase and apply replacement soles from the Birkenstock shoe store in my college town. My second pair lasted 20 plus years with episodic use. I became interested in wearing these sandals again when my son came home from college wearing a pair. I pulled out my old, well broken-in sandals and found them to be comfortable but the soles had lost their tread so walking on wet surfaces was dangerous. I had no problems getting replacement soles 30 years ago so I figured that with the internet it would be even easier now. NOT SO. It appears that either the German corporation or the US distributor has determined that this practice of supporting the individual consumer must stop. One can buy these soles on line but only if you buy enough to operate a cobbler's shop! I found a local cobbler and Birkenstock dealer who advertized on his website that he can repair Birkenstock sandals to ""as good as new"" but he flatly refused so sell me replacement soles. He does excellent work but he charges $95 to renovate a shoe that he sells in his store for $130. I find it hard to justify repairing a 30 year old shoe for 75% of the cost of a new shoe. I really like supporting local businesses but, sorry, sometimes it does not make economic sense.I love my new Sandals, adjusted for inflation the price can't be beat. They will take a while to break in as always and the sole will eventually wear down. If Amazon starts to offer for sale single replacement soles I will buy them and keep this pair for 20+ years too. Maybe my local cobbler will wake up and provide what the customer wants if Amazon gives him some direct competition. If all I want is a sole that I can glue on myself- let me have that. It is not too much to ask."
59651,1,These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers.
10548,1,Used them for years they give me a bounce to my step for my spring walks.
137382,0,"I had read that Keds was going back to its original quality rubber sole, but these have the same thin flappy soles that Keds have had for the last few years. The upper is also somewhat thin and scratchy, not like the original quality. I won't be fooled again."
47159,1,"My wife has a hard time finding strap-back velcro or buckle sandals in a wide width and a short size..... these are almost perfect. The only problem is that the buckle strap is very short and a bit hard for her to buckle - aside from that, she LOVES these sandals ! She says ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"""
211964,1,For me this is a perfect fit and oh so easy on the old feet. It was sized correctly and looks exactly as I wanted it. To go on would be redundant.
272642,1,Bought these to replace an old pair - lovely and dependable. More comfortable than cheaper flip flops and support my arches.
188264,0,"I ordered these as I was a personal care assistant and figured they would be cooler than tennis shoes with my scrubs. They are ok. I recomend buying a size smaller than you wear as they are actually a size to big. Have not wore them alot, but are an ok buy."
213623,1,"A little stiff at first, but now they fit great. Awkward spot for the velcro strap when you're standing and just trying to kick them off, but that's a minor quip in what is really a well designed shoe."
89195,1,"This shoe looks as good on as it does in the picture. And I was amazed at how light it feels, and how it fits perfectly around my foot. I originally bought these for trail biking, but so far have worked out and taken long walks in them; they are very comfortable. Will look for other shoes by this maker in the future."
317247,1,While I've always been a 608 fan the last ten years or so I was tempted to try the 609 model out. Very comparable in design and quality but it does appear they have ramped back a bit. Still all leather (assuming) upper and comfortable sole but the logo and some stitching has been sacrificed. I wear my sneakers to work as well as play and the 608 would give me a solid year and a half of daily abuse before needing replacement. I'll give the 609 a year at best. New Balance makes a decent shoe for the $$. I've paid more for less for sure.
174990,2,"I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer ""Scout"" pair which I already own and love. I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic. I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However, after receiving them, they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout. They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money. The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper, padded sole, and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather. The sole is not padded and sinks in. The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone"
243760,1,"They're Chucks, what more needs to be said. There is a reason they are still around after all these years."
379020,1,Bought these for my son and they are your basic Ariat boots. These are a lot more durable than the comparable Justin roper. These boots have become the boot of choice for my sons and myself.
315140,1,"I absolutely love these boots! As other buyers have commented, they are true to size. I hover between a size 10 and a 10 1/2, depending on the manufacturer. I purchased the size 10 and they fit perfectly; there's even a bit of room for a nice warm pair of socks. The toe box is square so your toes will not be squished in at all, even with heavy socks. I like these boots so much I'm planning on purchasing them in brown as well. I highly recommend buying these!!"
361746,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
63820,1,"these are really just what I wanted- classic and clean lines, Unfortunately too small, although I ordered my usual size 9 medium. so I had to return them."
330802,1,"My husband buys a new pair each year, so this is his 4th pair. Highly recommend these! He works construction and wears these out, but he loves that they are comfy and are reliable."
147310,0,"I bought for my daughter, she loves the boots, they came quickly, which was very important to her. We are very pleased with the product and the service."
164172,1,"I got alot of guff for ordering boots online without checking them out beforehand. Turns out, I get the last laugh! These boots are great! They're solid and comfortable. I wear them all day everyday and they hold up."
59113,1,What an awesome shoes!!! I have been buying the same model of running shoes for three yrs.Highy recommanded
217507,1,"I always liked Converse shoes and since i moved to the Dominican Republic, i've gone thru my share of overpriced fakes. I'm happy that i can get these online now. I like having shoes that go along with any type of clothing or colour.....any!!!!So yes, these are great and one cannot go wrong in purchasing a pair unless u get the wrong size. I will definitely buy another or others in different colours. No regrets on this purchase."
324005,1,"I have many pairs of shoe trees, and I like this style the best. They are spring loaded, which keeps pressure against the leather. This allows the sweat moistened leather to form back into shape, and prevents unsightly creases at the toe of the shoe. I use this specific pair on my Allen Edmonds Park Avenues, and they work just fine. I am a size 10.5/11, and the sizing chart was true to size."
232150,1,"The shoes are very comfortable, at first like any shoe, tight until you stretch them into the contour of your foot. Very agile and good for a multitude of sports. i would recommend to all to have a pair of Sambas. Not a single con that i can find."
261511,1,"Product was just as advertised. Only concern was that I did not receive a tracking number so I had no idea when exactly it would arrive. Other than that, great seller =)"
244552,1,"The shoes I purchased for my wife, were nice. Good fit, nice padding inside, and a excellent value. They are from Hushpuppies."
249422,1,"These shoes are adorable and very comfortable I absolutely love them. The craftmanship is beautiful, great attention to detail."
173406,1,"I bought these for my teen girl. She loves them! They are perfect for any ""big kid"" too!"
178367,0,"I liked the style, but I thought the boot ran small. I intentionally bought a 1/2 size larger and they fit as if they were a shoe, not a boot."
320227,2,when I opened the box and examined the shoes I wasn't expecting the leather at the tip of the shoe to be so bunched up. I can feel the rolls of leather under my toes as I dance. when trying to tighten the strings the one on the leftside on both shoes was glued in place. had to pull very hard to loosen and was afraid would pull the still right out. I will only use these till my new shoes arrive then these will collect dust in the back of my closet.
269480,1,"These shoes were just what I wanted. Great quality, comfortable fit, and the price was less than I expected."
241220,1,"I bought these for powerlifting, as an alternative to much more expensive lifting shoes. They are legal in the organization I lift in, and they are exactly what I need. The flat, thin sole is perfect for squatting and deadlifting with stability and safety.I could see durability of these shoes being a problem IF they were worn as an everyday shoe, i.e., outside, or to work / school. The canvas material is thin, and this is by no means a rugged pair of shoes. But for what I uses them for - strictly in the gym - they are excellent."
207552,1,"My wife says it's a very comfortable shoe but a bad color, and she asked why they don't make it in classic white. She also asked why Reebok doesn't make more women's shoes in a size 10.5, which is large enough to accommodate her orthotics as well as socks. Reebok has been her favorite manufacturer for years and she's sorry to have to start buying from others now that she has to buy a larger size than in the past. All in all, however, she says they fit very well, are light enough and are a great product for a very reasonable price."
150854,1,First time shoe buyer via internet. Purchased because I'd worn Propet before and was pleased with fit. Not disappointed! The fit was perfect and shoes delivered in a timely way.
297020,0,"Low stars because I never got to them try out. Bought the desert boot ankle high a little before. Oxford length was ok, but wrap around top of foot was way tight. Might try a 1/2 size larger on these. The desert boot ran a full size below just like another reviewer mentioned. I'd go 1/2 size below normal size on the oxford."
8047,1,very nice looking boot but they run narrow. the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me.
159812,1,"Chuck Taylors are just my style!! They look good with anything i wear, and are very comfortable. All you need are some black jeans with a white or black shirt and your good to go!!! My only problem is that people just can't seem to watch where they are going, so if I pat dirt out of it, it looks like the color fade's in that area. But overall great shoe to wear!!! Watch your feet though."
52464,1,These shoes are replacements for dome I have had for a long time...not worn them yet nut expect same quality as before.
258559,1,"They were a last minute Christmas gift. They came so quickly, the size was normal, the color fun, he loved them."
329193,0,"This boots are warm and comfortable, but they are much shorter than 10"".It is misleading to advertise them as 10"" when they are in fact 8""."
318241,0,"This is an attractive looking shoe that I receive many compliments on when I wear. I purchased it in the red which is deep in color, almost crimson. The red looks great when worn with jeans. My only complaint is they aren't the most comfortable shoes (usually the cute ones aren't), when worn for long durations of time."
359395,1,"Having had a pair of Crocs in the past I was happy to see they were available from Amazon, and sold by Amazon. I was able to get free shipping (to a US address), which is always a plus, and they arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I received exactly what I wanted and wouldn't hesitate to order them again should I need another pair in the future, I think they are very comfortable sandals. Now I'll have to order some Crocs flip flops, I hear they're better for your feet than regular flip flops."
271768,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
284728,1,This is a nice shoe-good heel and fit. My only complaint is that the color red is not really red. The box calls it winter red or something-more burgundy I'd say.
194975,1,"The shipping was prompt, the shoes are GREAT and I have another order ready to send! Thanks for your commitment to customer satisfaction!!"
297173,1,"I bought these becasue I like very flat and simple shoes. Some reviews say these run big, but I ordered my usual size 13 and they fit great."
366211,0,"This shoe runs a bit narrow, which means the tongue is barely covered by the laces. The fabric top also tends to fray where your toes rub against it. When it comes time to replace these shoes, it won't be with this model."
25771,1,I received the ited as described and within the expected time frame.Everything went well and I really can't complain so far.
105456,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
80496,1,Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable !! You can wear them all day and no problems.I bought them for my daughter and she loves them .
200612,1,Very happy with the size and look of this item. Have ordered these many years for my husband and he always says they are very comfortable and his favorite shoes.
180298,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
37314,1,"My stepson loves the Samba, and he gets a new pair every time he outgrows them. They are comfortable, supportive, and very stylish."
267859,1,"Great boot wear like sneakers but are tough and waterproof never had such a great pair of boots. I wear them daily and they never let me down,just a great product"
388605,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
93349,1,"These boots are hot! A little tight fitting, so if your wife or girlfriend's legs are anything but slender, pass. But I beg my wife weekly to put em on. :)"
227443,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
280089,1,"I recently purchased these for my 94 year-old mom who couldn't find them in her small Mississippi town. She wore her original pair over 30 years and felt they needed to be replaced. She loves her new slippers, perfect in every way. She feels the quality and fit are the same as the pair purchased three decades ago."
112907,1,I think these are the best feeling shoes I have ever worn. I love the way they fit and feel great for the long days I wear them. I like the color brown and the little strap holds it on comfortably. I only have one regret and that is thy didn't have any other colors. I would love to have black or burgandy atleast.from TN.
40843,1,"So far they seem really comfy like everyone says, but they run very small. I knew this and order a half size larger. Still too small. Now I have to deal with an Marketplace seller return. Stock these yourself Amazon!"
127550,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
116118,1,"I measured my daughters foot at 8 inches and ordered a size 2.5 (the size chart stated that the foot should measure 8 1/8 in. for size 2.5). I wanted to order them a bit bigger so she could have room to grow. They are a little big for her, but the draw string allows her to still wear them comfortably. If I would've went with size 2, they would've fit her perfectly. They are very nice ballet shoes and they arrived in about 5 days. My daughter loves them!"
12529,1,"Greetings, the purchase was made as effective as I have in my hands the product without any sort of trouble. Completely safe.Saludos, la compra fue efectuada de efectiva, ya tengo en mis manos el producto, sin ningun tipo de inconvenientes. Completamente seguro."
321611,1,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them. We got them a half size smaller because we heard they stretch over time. The color is slightly darker than pictured.
274081,1,i've been using these for about 2 months. and i've found that there better for bouldering because when you whereing these for awhile they dont provide alot of suport and your feet end up hurting for a few days.other than that they provide great grip. my most favorable shoes for overhang and compititions.
246400,1,"I wear a 5 or 5 1/2, so it's difficult for me to find shoes. I've also had foot surgery, so I want and need something that's comfortable. These shoes are great. They're small and comfortable for short and medium stints. They're not great if you're going to be on your feet all day. (I've wished I hadn't been wearing them on a couple of my all-day shopping sprees.) They also come in a variety of colors, which is very nice. This brown was a nice, dark brown - a neutral brown, unlike some of the lighter, redder, more milk chocolatey ones. They have a shelf life, though. The cushioning wears out, so I've learned when to call it quits and order another pair."
339559,1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quick with no hassles. Beats gas, time and crowds that are experienced when going to a brick and mortar store."
10110,1,"My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day. He wanted ""work"" boots so he could be like his Daddy. Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long. He is very hard on footwear, but so far these seem to be holding up well. He even wears them to school on days he doesn't have gym."
190993,1,"This shoe was superb when I used it for my highschool football team. I was able to run my fastest and not feel dragged down by a pound of lead, with out the high cut ankle support I was able to cut faster and throw off almost all of my defenders. This shoe really did enhance my perfromance. Ideal for wide receivers and running backs."
174726,2,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
188326,1,I like the shoes but my wife says they are ugly. They are a very dull off white. Not like new tennis sneakers. I wear them in the river and they drain pretty well when I get out. Other water shoes I have worn drain better. The shoe is stiffer then a typical water shoe and when you are jet skiing I am not fearful they will fall off.
4995,1,"The pictures do this purse no justice. I'd been eyeing it for so long, and bought it in black at a Betsey Johnson store. It's on clearance at Betsey Johnson right now, so don't pay full price!!This bag is called the ""Union Johnson"" because it has the Union Jack (England's flag) sewn in strips of leather on the front. It has two side pockets perfect to slide nearly any cell phone in. The lining is white with black stars, has a Betsey Johnson pink label sewn in, and has a few charms dangling inside. There are also 3 pockets on the inside. One is zippered (with a charm dangling from the zipper) and the other two are open pockets. This is a VERY spacious bag. I'm able to fit my very large Gucci sunglasses case in there, as well as my eye glasses case, and a wallet, small notebook, brush, medications, and make-up...and there's room to spare!! Not only is it large and spacious, but I'm a tiny 5'1 90 lb woman...most large purses look odd on me, but this purse wears like a small one!Another great detail are the metal bits. With pyramid metal spikes along the loops, and chain detailed straps, it gives an extra punk rock oomph. I may own a ton of designer purses, but since I bought this one, it's the only one I use!"
102842,1,"These shoes are very comfortable, ideal for Zumba classes, and also line dancing. Allows much more foot motion than tennis shoes. Bought one-and-a-half size bigger than normal shoe (normal is 6-1/2, ordered 8) and the fit was perfect. Would recommend to anyone doing any type of dancing. Free shipping from Amazon was quite speedy, and my feet thank you!"
377743,1,They are a great slipper. In fact I have them on this very minute
118264,1,"I ordered this shoe 1/2 a size bigger since my daughter is growing up so fast and I want it to last little longer; I also like that it comes in ""wide"". The lace makes the shoe adjustable, it ""hugs"" the foot so it is steady while she dances. A question I personally had was if this are true to the street shoe size that she wears daily, and it is! A great buy and will come back again when I have to buy the next size. I'm very pleased with this purchase!"
176650,0,"Felt amazing at first, but the little foot-massaging knobs quickly started breaking and falling out everywhere. I'm still wearing them, but they're not nearly as comfortable."
360272,1,"I needed shoes for a burlesque dance class. Many people recommended capezio. These shoes are lightweight, comfortable and true to size. Highly recommended"
346739,1,Sent these to my daughter in law in Calif I live in Indiana very convient. She let me know what size and color also sent her a picture and a birthday message Very nice. very happy very very satisified

6472,1,"By far, New Balance is the best sneaker manufacturer. I bought a pair of 715 sneakers 2 years ago, and they still fit great! If you have slightly wide feet, you'll appreciate the fit and style of these sneakers. Highly recommended."
49810,0,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves."
104832,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortably, and look awesome. I was skeptical at first, but ever since I have received my pair of Red/White/Blue, I have not found a single flaw. These shoes will bring the old school back into your life and then some. Get a couple pairs of these things and wear a different color each day!"
277908,0,"I purchased a pair of altitude iv boots from amazon a week ago. I had a chance to wear and test them yesterday. I was very unsatisfied with the way that they preformed. The ""cleat like"" sole made it impossible to walk up a slightly inclined damp board. If I was able to return these shoes I would without hesitation, but instead I am stuck with a pair of boots that I feel are useless bordering on unsafe. These boots are one dimensional; they seem to work well if you only walk on soft earth or dirt. If you plan to wear these in to town... don't buy. They seem to be affordable, but found them cheaper at my local outdoor store.**Update**While I stand behind what I said above... These boots did turn out to be very comfortable. The footbed provides good arch support. They are very much a hiking/ snow clearing boot. Great if you don't intend to wear them to work. The rubber on a work boot like (timberland pro) is very different and allows the wearer to walk up a wet inclined board while these are better suited for a muddy inclined path."
79066,1,"Been wearing converse for years; great shoes, came just as promised in the picture and description. Cheaper, even with the shipping expenses, then in the stores where you can find all black chucks. Shoes packaged very well; shipping was ridiculously fast, had it in two days; great amazon experience!"
323487,1,The club c is a classic everyday summer kick i wore them in my teens but in my adult yrs I could not fine them in the stores so this was tremendous to have caught them on amazon for such a great price they shiped right away and the fit was excellent (good look)
209181,1,"These aren't quite the quality of my previous Sperry Topsiders, but they're still really excellent shoes. These are a hair tighter and the leather quality isn't quite as soft. However, I believe that if you're looking for boat shoes, you'll have trouble finding better shoes than these."
324519,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
358674,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and are perfect for my dance lessons. I'm just a beginner, so I didn't want to spend too much on shoes; I picked these based upon the price and excellent reviews. I did order a half size larger - I usually wear an 81/2 wide, but ordered a 9 wide based upon prior reviewers' comments."
26762,0,I liked these shoes....they were very cute! But I had to return them only because my class offered us free shoes....or else I would have kept these. I'm giving them 3 stars because I did not like the return process. They made me pay for shipping when I returned them back to them.
200634,1,"The item received is what we expected, the color, the size and the delivery were perfect.This is the first time that I ordered in amazon and service has been wonderful.Now I have given this item as a birthday gift for my husband and he is now enjoying the comfort of it.Sperry Mens Eye Sahara Shoe - Tan X 8"
48602,1,This is my third pair of Brooks Beast shoes. I have been extremely happy with the support - my arches are non-existent - and they are comfortable from the first time you put them on. They seem to wear as well as other similar shoes I have had. I get about a year out of them but I am mainly a walker.
164895,1,"The shoes were perfect but my Mother needed a 9.5 N and the shoe came in as a 9N and I had to return it. It cost me $15.00 to return the shoe and I wanted the right size but I received the credit for the shoes only on my credit card but not for the shipping either way! So I wasn't happy and probably won't use this service again.Thanks,kathy"
64693,1,I got these Keds black canvas sneakers for my Mom for Christmas. She totally loved them!! Said they fit great and were very comfortable. Black canvas is hard to find in the stores ~ especially in such a small size ~ so I was delighted to find them online. Package arrived on time and in great condition. I highly recommend this product and vendor.
324009,1,Very good sturdy product which met all of my needs. My shoes certainly appreciate them. well made for continual use. ana a great price.

153344,1,This is the 2nd pair of this style Easy Spirit I have purchased and I love them. It is like walking on air!
383283,1,"I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart. They were so very comfortable, and worked well with different types of outfits, including shorts and capris. The only problem, (which other people have mentioned), is that they do tend to run narrow, so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe, I think that they are a great value.Addendum: I now have three pairs of these shoes, in different colors. Except for the times that I need to wear sneakers, I find that I am wearing a pair of the sandals, to the exclusion of all my other shoes.Update: I now have four pairs of these shoes. No matter what I am wearing, I seem to always go back to one of these ""Mimosas""."
291953,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
115726,1,"Purchased 2 pairs of the Bonnie Lite oxfords; in Navy and Bone. They have a nice cushiony fit with adequate room and, of course, the leather uppers are soft and supple. The rubber soles seem to be slip-proof as well."
209199,1,"In the last 30 years, I've owned 3 pair of Sperry Topsiders -- that's how long they last.... and I wear them a lot. This will be my 4th pair. They're great on the boat, they're great at the office, and I even wear them practicing taiji (flat bottoms and fit are perfect)."
53564,1,The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site.
324801,1,"These are the best wrestling shoes I have ever worn, and ever seen to date. The Velcro top makes matches much simpler since you don't have to tape your laces. The shoe is very comfortable and has an excellent look, I just wish I could get my hands on a pair again!"

322568,1,"I've been doing ballet-style workout DVDs at home lately, and wanted a pair of ballet shoes to use for those workouts so that I'd have better grip and support. I can't speak to how well these work for ballet classes, but I thought that my review might help others like me who are buying these for the same reason.Based on some reviews, I ended up ordering these at first one size larger than what I usually wear in my street shoes. The 8.5 that I bought (instead of my usual 7.5) were huge, but (thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy), I returned these and ordered a 7.5, which fit perfectly.The ribbon at the front of the shoe can be pulled tight to adjust the width of them, and they are very comfortable. They don't have a split sole on the bottom; instead, the sole is one long piece that stretches down the length of the shoe.If you're looking for some at-home ballet-style workouts, I also recommend Mary Helen Bowers'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body WorkoutandBallet Beautiful: Body Blastand Leah Sarago's four workouts, especially her newest oneBallet Body Signature Series: Total Body. All of these are a lot of fun to do, and make me feel like a ballerina!"

214041,1,"For the cost of these, I expected something much better made. The buttons started falling the first day they were worn!The boots themselves are cozy, hold up well and actually hold out moisture nicely."
85445,1,"I've had a great experience with this brand and these super cute boots don't disappoint. I was looking for this style to add to my wardrobe but purchased these for the look. Although this style can be a little too masculine for me, the beautiful soft gray and pink color combination makes them a fashinable comination of sporty andladylike."
109293,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
24193,1,LOVE the boots! I was a little nervous ordering boots online because I've have bad luck with boots fitting properly. I lucked out because these fit perfectly. They look very nice and seem sturdy. Not much sole/arch support but that's easily fixed with some gel pads. Love the connivence of the side zipper. With my last boots it was a chore lacing the boots and having them become loose and having to constantly re-lace them to tighten them. Very pleased with these boots!
139317,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."

117770,0,"Just received these ballet shoes and they are cute BUT they are way, way off in sizing. In the same order, I had also received size 6.5 toddler stride rite shoes and they fit just right (even a little big, which she will grow into the next few months) and also a size 7 Pediped shoes and those are way, way big (still planning on growing into these) So I ordered a size 7 in the ballet shoes and not only are they tight, her toes are totally scrunched up in them...I can't believe how off the sizing is!"

29651,1,"I ordered this in black, it is very rugged and well put together. I have my doubts about the pouch clasps being efficient in combat, however I bought this with the idea of carrying a wallet, cigarettes, leatherman, etc The pouch is nice sized and the loop on back is big and well secured. I would highly recommend this product for non-combat use."
194151,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
359227,1,1st time wearing Crocs and they are very comfortable. I ordered the shoe on the 15th and received it on the 17th. I have the raspberry color which are true to the picture. The only thing I do not like about the shoe is that it is made for wider feet. I ordered a size 9 but they feel like a 9w; however very comfortable!
257386,1,We purchased these shoes for my daughter. She went to AKON in them and they were part of her outfit. She said that they worked well for this (not for everyday wear). No complaints here!
333996,1,"Wallabees are awsome shoes. They are a bit pricey, but worth every penney. Extremely comfortable."
33151,0,"I usually wear a 10AAA, but this shoe was too narrow for me. Maybe it would have stretched out, but I don't have the patience for that. So I had to return it."
298193,1,"I originally purchased the Beeswax version over 10 years ago in NYC. I dragged them through the rain, snow, slush, and sun; and they were great (minus wet and cold feet). I joined the military, and these sat in storage for 8 years. Pulled them out and slipped them on, and they felt just like the last time. Ditched those, and purchased a brand new pair. Needless to say, I'm still in love. They are stylish, comfortable, and excellent for long walks immediately out of the box."
332773,1,"I bought my first pair of Crocs while recovering from neck surgery over two years ago. I was really looking for some walking shoes so I could exercise in the Mall. Well, the Crocs were on display so I tried them on. Cheap, lightweight and oh, so comfortable. I figured they would last a few months and they would get tossed but, so what? Well I've worn that original pair for all this time and I've been using them this summer for my yard work. I hose them off and leave them by the back door. They've gotten beat up and they're now pretty worn looking but they are still comfortable and still practical for a yard shoe.Of course, they're goofy-looking in all those electric colors and that funky toe shape. Not an issue for me.These things are as comfortable as Birkenstock sandals and clogs but cost considerably less. They're so cheap, I don't mind abusing them. And they take the abuse and only need a quick hosing down to be clean and ready for more abuse.Since that original pair, I've bought two more. One pair is kept by the front door and one in the RV. I just ordered two more pair from Amazon on sale. I can always justify comfortable shoes."
246373,1,"These are my 5th and 6th Florsheim Comfortech Rivas (Burgundy and Black). I began wearing them in 1978, when they were sold under the French Shriner label and have not been without at least two pair ever since. The design and production rights (thankfully) passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shriner marque disappeared.The shoes are the ULTIMATE IN COMFORT! The uppers are of glove-soft kidskin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthetic material. They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions.The factory finish is as durable as a patent leather, without the extremely high gloss plastic look.They are extremely durable, as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear. I've never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel. Ultimately, the uppers will wear through on the flex creases or at the base, where the upper is joined to the sole. You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish, especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment.They are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of $100 to $110 that you see most often, but are an unbelievable bargain at the $90/pair charged by Amazon.If I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim, it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability.I personally, would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe. I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels.These shoes are not perfect, but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Riva.Give them a try -- I think you will come to love them as I do!Neil CoddingtonAlbuquerque"
240128,1,you can't beat the price and the quality is great. I ordered it on a Friday and had it on Monday! How is that for fast shipping. It is much better quality than the cheap plastic things you get at the bank. I am very pleased.
378300,1,"I ordered 1/2 size larger for my daughter and had to return for a full size larger. They definitely run small. My suggestion is to try it on at a local dance supplier and then purchase for the lower price. Once you get the right fit, the shoes are great !!! Dancing everyday for hours and no problem !!!"
79592,1,Love 'em and they arrived super fast! They are very comfortable even though they're chucks! Definitely going to order them in more colors!
2734,1,"This stuff will save you hundreds of dollars in shoe repair! Save every pair of shoes in your closet that has lost its sole, peeled off it's lining, cracked a heel, you name it! I have fixed 3 pairs of shoes so far, and I'm just getting started. Wonderful goo!"
87583,1,It is very difficult to find slippers in my husband's size (size 15) so was very excited when I found these at a great price. Have held up through 2 winters now.
326993,1,I love reefs! This product was exactly as it was advertised and it arrived in a timely fashion in clean packaging. Thanks!
217356,1,"I like these shoes and they look & feel great (especially for $20.90). But the other reviewers are definitely right in that they come out of the box with black ""distress"" mark son the sand or cream colored leather. While it's disappointing that the pictures don't clearly show that, the marks are applied way too evenly and carefully to not be intentional. I still think they look good, but if you want a ""clean"" looking shoe, this might not be the one."
276133,0,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
264356,1,Love my boots. Have wore them twice with no problem. They fit great and no break in time required.
112672,1,"I absoultely LOVE this shoe. I wish now I had bought in multiple colors instead of just the one as they are no longer available. It fits well, looks great and one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn."
127051,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
27981,1,"I was very pleased with these shoes! They are so cute and look well-made. I ordered a 1/2 size larger and they fit fine. My two-year-old grandson was as pleased with these shoes as a two-year-old can be. He is a big ""Cars"" fan.The only disappointment was that they didn't light up and I thought they might."
74701,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
272518,1,"I am a huge Teva fan and have about 4 pairs in the original thong style. I wanted something a little more strappy and decided to give these a try since I already really enjoy Teva sandals. These did not disappoint. I have a wide foot so the straps need to be stretched out a bit so it took a few wears until they fit my feet better. After that they were perfect. I live in the city so I do a lot of walking and wanted something that wouldn't give me a ton of blisters. These worked well and have such a thick sole that there is no way these can't be comfortable for a days walk. Would recommend to anyone who does a lot of walking and wants I slightly nicer, very comfortable flip flop."
182667,2,I am really sorry I bought these shoes. They look pretty good but they are damn squeaky when walking across non carpet in the office. Embarrassing!

148997,1,Just as I ordered. Work perfectly for his practice games. Size wasaccurate. After washing still comfortable.I would recommend to anyone.
235903,1,"I saw these moccasins in a store in San Juan Capistrano CA but by the time I went back to get them, they did not have my size anymore, so I found them on Amazon.com. Lucky me! They are so soft, and comfortable. I like the color because it is neutral and I can wear them with anything and they will be good in warm weather."
125822,1,I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma &quot;Anjan&quot;.
380646,0,"I ordered a half-size larger, in response to reviews here, and that was good advice. But alas, one shoe was larger than the other, even though marked the same size. Amazon, as always, was great about the return. Apart from that, it's a fun shoe at a good price."

335471,1,"This year I bought 6 pairs of Crocks, love them all exeps this shining material of these Crocs Classic Clog,Cotton Candy,Women's. But I am happy because my gran child always ask me to wear these."
336469,1,My husband works very hard and destroys his boots fairly quickly. This is his second pair of these boots and he asked that I get the exact same as his last pair. They have lasted him about 8 months which is 2 months longer then normal. He does wear insoles with them to help the comfort level.
287517,2,"If you have worn Rockport Prowalker in the past please note that the design of this shoe has changed over the past 1-2 years. I recently ordered a pair and the padding is much reduced, the leather is not as soft. The shoes may be OK and well made but they are not the style you may be used to if you have worn this stlye in the past."

174719,1,"Naturalizer Scout ShoesI have been looking for another pair of these shoes for years now. Not carried in our local stores. I didn't know they still made them. I had two pairs which I wore until they wore out. I will be ordering more, so keep them stocked. I hope they keep making them! I have feet that are very hard to fit, so that the Velcro strap helps. So does the design and comfortable heels. But I mustn't praise them too much or you'll be all sold out next time I want to buy a pair."
183429,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
150502,1,"I actually ordered the black suede/black leather shoes and received these by mistake. But they're so interesting and comfortable I decided to keep them. The suede is so soft it's almost like wearing slippers that conform perfectly to your feet. I don't usually like patent leather and that's what the toe portion of the shoes are made of but it's really attractive. I'd recommend these shoes to even the most conservative among us. Try it, I think you'll like them."
202456,1,"These are without a doubt the most comfortable slippers I have ever worn. It is like walking on clouds. I just wish I could wear them to work!!! Don't hesitate buying these, you won't be sorry I promise. They can be a little tight through the Velcro, but just like new shoes, they ease with time. I will never buy any other slipper."
76130,1,"I nought these for a concert. Even though I was standing for quite a few hours, they were actually very comfortable. My boyfriend absolutely loves these."
356806,0,BOUGHT THESE SHOES FOR MY GIRL. WE ORDERED BLACK AND WHITE BUT WHEN RECIEVED THE SHOES THEY WERE ALL BLACK. SHE SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE BUT WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED FOR NOT GETTING THE COLOR SHE WANTED
273111,1,"This is the third pair of Five Ten Spire shoes that I have owned. They are great for long days on multi-pitch climbs. The leather upper forms to my feet and gives just enough to make a great all day shoe. The four star rating is because they seem to wear a little faster than my other shoes. If you are looking for comfort and performance for an entry level price, this is one shoe to try."
330393,1,These were some nice comfortable boots that looked stylish with jeans or dress pants. They made people look twice at my feet. They wear nice and are not heavy.
12166,1,Exactly the same as what I was expecting. Size and color was perfect. It is nice to wear with skinny jeans.
220024,1,I wore Keds as a child and loved them. I got these to wear with a poodle skirt because I couldn't find any saddle oxoford shoes to suit me. I am looking forward to wearing my new Keds.
362670,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
16633,1,"Best shoes ever sold. Been wearing them since I was 14, and will never change. Tried to get a trendy pair before, but was greatly disappointed. Shipping was really fast to my FPO address. Thank you."
327111,2,"Horrible shoes. Sucks, Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes"
144906,1,"I wear my UGGs with my custom orthotics inside. I was a high heels wearer for many years and developed a bone spur, and had to have surgery on one of my feet. I was looking for something that would keep my feet warm, and not 'hug' all over the incision. I orginally thought I wouldn't like the look of UGGS on my skinny legs, but soon found the soft lining didn't leave me with all the empty space around my legs, the boots didn't irritate my incision they were so soft, and my orthotics fit in them with no problem. The only issue now is that I can't really stand wearing other shoes/boots. I commute in my Uggs, I wear them in the house when it's cold, I wear them when I can in warmer weather without socks, and I find myself re-arranging my wardrobe to match the boots! This is year 2 for me with my UGGSs, and I have to say, I get more wear out of them than any other shoe or boot that I own so they are a real bargain."
99667,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
219726,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
367987,1,I had to break them in a little at the beginning but now they feel like slippers!
222958,1,Not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised once they arrived. Delivery took forever because of the processing of the order...
70973,1,"This is an all-around great pair of wrestling shoes! I train MMA a little bit and with some of the drills the mats basically shave off the skin on my feet and I used to get blisters too! With these I get great grip and protection for my feet and if you tie them up correctly then you get good ankle support too.One thing, keep off of carpet while wearing them. Pet hair and lint sticks to the bottom like glue (the bottom is rubber in some areas) and therefore reduces traction until you clean them off (lick your finger and rub the rubber and it takes the dirt off).They are very comfortable too, and I have big feet so it's hard to find comfy shoes. I'd wear these everywhere if they didnt wet through so bad in rain and snow."
250544,1,"The Easy spirit punter I ordered recently is the 4th pair of the same shoe I have worn the past few years. I could not find locally anymore at Macys or Belk--Town Center Mall in Kennesaw--so I went to Amazon to order. Easy to do and so pleased I found them still being made. Easy spirit--please don't ever stop making this shoe. They fit me well and don't wear out. They just get old looking since I wear them frequently whether going to the store, on fishing trips, yard work, etc. Shoes arrived promptly as stated by Amazon. Thanks"
252246,0,I bought this for my husband to wear as work shoes as he is standing all day and he needs ankles support. The leather and manufacture seems pretty flimsy and smells really bad. And not like leather but like chemicals. The inside lining looks cheap. Too bad I bought two pairs.
158994,1,"hella cool chucks..theyre not cheap, good quality..i was satisfied and so would you be...one minor problem is that purple passion (which is the one i ordered) wasnt the exact color as the one shown...but its still cool!! i love them"
342153,1,"I had a pair of caterpillar 6&#34; boots that I really liked so I bought another pair. These are very good boots, feel good and look good."
241829,1,"I'm a mom who loves Adidas Originals. I wear a 9.5 womens and the 8 mens fit great. I'm average width and although sized for men, the width is fine on these. I purchased the beige and they look fantastic with jeans. The leather is super high quality. The suede can be fragile and stain easily (like all suede does), so spray with waterproofer to keep it nice. They are very comfy right away-no break in period needed. Overall, a nice, solid, cool and classy pair of sneakers that will never go out of style. The $24.99 price is beyond a steal-they're $80.+ everywhere else."
45092,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
210304,1,"fast, beautifull, same as picture, new, great atention, great price, exactly as I ordered, don't know what to say, everything ok thanks, see you next time"
212767,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
382910,1,"I have worn Easy Spirit AP1's for years. I have bony ankles and these shoes are cut low, so as not to hit the bones. They have great traction and the leather lasts and lasts. I generally pay $70, so $53 is a great price. The white leather does get dirty. You can throw them in the washer. (NOT the dryer, of course). I have found that they can be polished with the good, old fashioned ""Hollywood Sani-White"" that we used to use for children's and nurses' white leather shoes. (Shake well before using!) This does get chalky, so I then buff them and spray on a clear polish. I've removed the sockliner and replaced it with magnetic insoles. My feet and knees never hurt anymore. Ten stars!!"
94607,1,"I have purchased Ryka shoes for about 20 years. These are the only shoes I will buy. They are always a perfect fit and are made for only women. Unlike other top name brands that are made for men and then sized to fit women. In all the years I have bought Ryka I have never had one problem. They always fit perfect. Never any blisters or sore feet trying to break them in. Once you go Ryka you will never go back to expensive, poor fitting shoes."
380607,1,"they really fit good, are comfortable and nice and smooth for dancing.Glad that I made this purchase would do again"
328172,1,I purchased this product to use in acid washing my pool. They fit great and have a knee high length to keep the splashes off my clothing. Good Quality and slip resistant.
49677,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
233603,1,Great shoes. Cheap price. Will come back for more ipaths if available. Word word word word word word word word word... is that twenty?
134186,1,"I had a pair of these sandals and wore them so long there was nothing left but the straps! When I found the same shoe on Amazon, I jumped at the opportunity to buy it."
106168,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
274004,0,"I bought the size I would typically in the glass, and they are seriously tight. I would have probably gone up a half size if I had been able to try them on. I think it is fixable with a shoe stretcher, and this is just a warning."
375068,1,"I've worked Corrections for over 23 years, and until a few years ago spent a lot of money on boots. I've owned several different brands/styles. Some were really comfortable but wouldn't last six months. Others were quite durable, but felt like walking with concrete blocks on your feet. My feet used to hurt so bad after pounding concrete for a shift, when I would get up in the morning the first few steps were VERY painful. Then, a couple of my co-workers told me I should try Danner's, so I did. I've worn the uninsulated, plain-toe Acadias for about five years now, and the excruciating morning foot pains I used to have are gone. I ditched the insole that came with them (they're junk) and bought a decent pair of work insoles that worked fine. I will be sending mine off for their fourth resole as soon as my just ordered backup pair arrives this week. Then, I'll be alternating pairs. They work fine for me in the winter with a decent pair of insulated socks, if my toes get chilly then that tells me I've been stationary too long. Never had wet feet, either. It took my first pair a week or so to break in, then they were fine. I like the wider sole, very stable. They look good and wear better. Very satisfied with my Danner's."
219642,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
378969,1,"VERY COMFORTABLE SHOE, FOR ANY ACTIVITY,THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE RUBBER THAT COMES UP OVER THE TOES OF THE SHOE CAME LOOSE ON BOTH SHOES AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS OF WEARING THEM."
201423,0,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
225468,1,"The shoes arrived in perfect condition, true to size (10.5) fabulous bright red color, not a problem at all. Would definitley do business with the seller again. Thank you!"
196914,1,"My husband thought the boots were very comfortable, soft leather, not too heavy. He has not worn them to work in yetbut they fit very nicely and seem like they will be good quality work boots. The price was reasonable, too."
330862,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
136782,1,"I absolutely love my red Chucks. They are a timeless look that can be worn with your favorite jeans, tailored slacks, or a mini. And at such a great price, a better buy than the more modern sneakers in the same category. The shoes do run big, so be sure to the follow the suggestion of ordering two sizes smaller than your normal shoe size. I recieved my order from Eastbay within 3 days of purchase."
179755,1,"These shoes are what I was looking for..but, they do run a little big. So be sure to get a size down from your regular size. I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe..They are comfortable and you cant beat the price..shipping was pretty face as well."
348104,1,Well designed and rugged-formal or casual-as light and as comfortable as my running shoes. True to size. Clarks Rule-I have 3 pairs and love them!
58137,1,"I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid. I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago, so haven't had to look for new till now. Well, almost the same sneaker... These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone. I'm sorry about that, as it gave them a more streamlined appearance. But unless these new Champions don't wear well, I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now."
227426,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
372088,1,"This purchase was very good choice, since they are an excellent pair of shoes, very comfortable, a good choice for day to day. Additionally, the shipping and delivery was prompt and the product was in perfect condition."
114151,1,Kenneth Cole shoes are the most comfortable and casually classy shoes. I'd reccommend to anyone. These are VERY comfortable on the foot. at 6'4 250 its rare to find shoes that both look good and dont kill my feet. Every KC shoe ive ever had has been all aces.
135528,1,"No, I am not out on a cross country ""Walk for Peace"" but when I wear these shoes every step I take promotes World Peace. I have a red pair of peace shoes and I bought my mom a pair of pink ones. We love wearing them out together - we are a Mother/Daughter team making a double statement! Also, we get many comments - whether together or alone. People just love them! I wish I had these Peace shoes in 3 or 4 other colors."
275389,1,i have always enjoyed the altitude but here i managed to find some at a decent price.comfortable feel and not a killer price is what hi-tec seems to be good at.develery was right on time too.
349923,1,"this is really my first pair of pumas, i love them. the last 5 or 6 years i'v been wearing adidas shelltops. which i love, but these pumas are so comfortable its like im wearing slippers all day, i love the color too so cute!! the only problem is they get dirty very quick and they are kinda hard to clean. mine have color transfer from my jeans rubbing on them and i cant get it out. i love them so much i bought a second pair for summer when i wear capris or shorts that wont be dirty! they fit pretty true to size, if you have never worn this style before be aware near the toes they are cut a little narrow. so if u have wide feet these wont be good for you"
309457,0,"I was so excited to finally be able to afford these sandals. Although the soles felt great, the area around the toe was too loose and sure to cause a blister. I reluctantly returned them."
158319,1,My neice 's them!! They were her favorite color.Very stylish and comfortable!Would recommend to anybody that likes this style of shoe.
194775,0,"The leather is very nice, the shoes seem well built, but the pictures on the website are not entirely representative. In fact, these shoes look more like texan boots (pointy tips) when worn. Not a classy mixture, if you ask me."
333452,1,"I like Sebago boat shoes, but this is my first pair of Penny Loafers from the brand. I usually like Cole Haan and Bostonian dress shoes, but based on the quality, comfort and durability of Sebago's boat shoes, I wanted to try these.Originally, I bought these in my regular size of 9 1/2D but I literally could not even get my feet into the shoes, so I bought a 10E and they fit fine. However, I probably should have just gotten the 9 1/2E as the half size larger has required a heel pad as the shoes have broken in.These shoes are made of thick, high quality leather. A bit stiff at first, but they mold to your foot as they break in resulting in a snug, comfortable fit.The soles are leather, but are not slippery ""out of the box"" as many leather-soled shoes are.Amazon's price was $78.00 (I think) at the time of my purchase (the ""too narrow"" 9 1/2's were bought from another website which was charging about $25.00 more).Happy with these shoes so far and I have actually received a compliment or two (three actually) since getting them.I will probably buy the Oxblood/Cordovan color when my Cole Haans get too trashed to wear with a suit."
59687,1,"I am very hard on soles and have finally worn these out after two years of hard use. These shoes do it all- look nice, keeps water out, and is the most comfortable I have ever worn. I am looking to get the exact same pair- but hard to find on sale anywhere but since the are so nice, they are worth the price."
7013,0,"the style of the boot is very cute. it fits really loose, not sure if they're just too big but i ordered the same size shoe that i wear normally. they are pretty thin so don't expect them to keep your feet much warmer than sneakers, they just cover a little more leg. the lacy part of the shoe easily gets dog hair stuck in it and also catches on things. I bought boots to help keep my feet dry at work and i knew that these particular boots wouldn't be ""water proof"" but these get wet instantly! my skate shoes protect against the water better than these. so these boots are ""cute"" but they aren't made well at all."
228845,2,"I hate the boots! I purchased a pair for $110 in October of 2012. After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder. Regardless of the floor surface; carpet, concrete, or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder. It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem. I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $15.Thanksgiving goes by, then Christmas, then New Years with no word about my shoes. Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes. A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland. I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again. I am out $125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise."
41609,1,"These were for my son who wears a size 15EEE shoe. These are perfect for him. He loves to walk, and now he can do it pain free."
191231,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
90244,1,"I have always found this particular brand and styling of shoe comfortable. I probably should have purchased a wide rather then the normal width. But overall I am generally very happy with this shoe, just need to wear thin socks and I hope they break in quickly. I have purchased the brown ones in the past and they seemed more comfortable for some reason on the inside (???)!It's been a number of years though since I purchased this type of shoe. The only thing I can think of is perhaps the materials are slighty different now. Just seems ALOT stiffer. Where as the previous ones felt so comfortable right out of the box."
377512,1,"My hysband is very picky about his slippers. His feet always get hot and sweaty. These were the perfect xmas present. They didn't have all the sheep fleece that make his feet sweat, but were still soft and comfortable. He's still raving about how comfy they are. Size it pretty right on too."
212921,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
133057,1,"These sandals feel pretty good, but also they make my heels feel lower than the rest of my foot. Not sure about that yet. But the leather is very soft."
363738,1,"I originally bought these to finish off my Tenth Doctor costume, but they're actually really nice shoes. I wear them often and they are quite comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the colored band on the sole has started to come up on one of them... It isn't glued to the shoe very well. But for what I paid for them, I'm willing to let that slide."
145612,1,"Delivery was prompt and I finally received just what I ordered. It took me 3 tries to get these. First 2 times the store sent me the wrong color. Amazon was wonderful with the return, couldn't have asked for better service. The third time Amazon used a different fulfillment store and I got just what I wanted. They're so comfortable and keep my feet toasty warm and yet cool at the same time. I wore them in CO and the days were warm and yet my feet felt cool, and when the temp went down at nite, while the tips of my ears were cold, my feet were toasty warm and without sweating. Although a little pricey, I'd recommend these to everyone."
346393,1,Sweeet!...my boy is flipping over these. He wants to wear them everywhere - I drew the line at church.
19029,1,This is my second pair of Propet Walkers. I love the velcro closures and the support that these walkers provide. I've never washed them but like the idea if I ever needed to.
60010,1,"These have been great boots. I am on my fourth pair of the Altitude series- a version I, version II, and now 2 version IVs. All have been good buys for me. The version IV have been the best but all have been good.First, I have a high arch and have always been hard on any footwear with a tendency to walk on the 'outside' of my foot. I wear these boots to travel in and work in while traveling. Many a mile in airports, many miles on concrete, gravel, dirt, and inside simulation facilities. When I travel I tend to only take these boots - my work rarely requires dress clothes, the boots look good in an open collar work environment, they are comfortable, and taking only 1 pair of shoes does cuts down on packing requirements quite a bit for longer trips (3 weeks or longer in duration).I have taken these boots on three overseas trips - they did well in the Scottish highlands (twice), and London. They did equally well on the beaches of Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, and Cancun. They have done me well in wet and sand - hot and cold.To add to this endorsement, not only am I hard on shoes I am also quite fat these days - topping 300 pounds. For my health I maintain a walking routine of 1-3 miles a day whenever possible. When I travel, these boots are also my walking shoes.In general Hi Tec have always fit me well. I go back 40 or so years to wearing the Lite series of Hi Tecs while I was in my running the Appalachians days. Given my high arches, a tendency for very bad calluses, rebuilt right ankle, 2 knees that varied doctors have wanted to cut on since early Army days, and now my weight I am very picky on shoes. These are the best of the Hi Tec boot types that I have found.I suspect I have seen the best of my current set of boots - maybe six more months or so of regular wear till they become yard work shoes till their final demise. I have never worn out the uppers in these boots. I have worn the sole down to a smooth surface and worn out the insides (after using new insole inserts a couple of times). They are tough boots.And I have a back up pair ready to take the place of the current set.On a down side, these style of boots (in general, not just Hi Tec) are not sturdy enough for doing squats in Power Lifting circles. One needs a higher and stiffer boot than what the modern ilk of hikers provides. This is the only limitation I have found for these boots."
196475,1,"Shipping was way fast, this is my 5th pair of Chucks the black on black is slick, they breath better than any other shoe ive ever owned and it definitely wont be my last pair."
344553,1,"These boots replaced a pair that had finally worn out after over 10 years of frequent wear. I was expecting and dreading an uncomfortable break-in period. To my surprise and immense joy, these boots -- size 9.5D -- slipped on easily and fit comfortably from the very first wearing. NB: I wear them with insoles and they fit snugly but are not tight.The soles of the boots provide sufficient and safe grip/traction on slippery surfaces but still slide well enough for dancing. They also take and hold a shine extremely well.I've had several occasions to wear them in rainy weather and my feet stay completely dry even after wading through shallow puddles.I wasn't happy with the tags on the exterior. They are easily removed.All in all, these boots are a great value. I wear them almost every day and highly recommend them to anyone wanting a comfortable, dressier style of cowboy boot."
151441,1,"I bought this pair for church. It has worked out very well. They are comfortable and my son does not complain at all when he has to wear them. They are similar to black tennis shoes. The only problem I have is when he plays on his knees (with match box cars, etc) The tops get scuffed and show wear."
373025,1,I got as a casual peice and also to wear to work they are half a size to big but I will live. Great Buy
148657,0,The shoe was pretty firm and scratched up the sides of feet. It was cushioned well and wasnt made of soft leather.
7957,0,"I actually returned this boot. It's a nice boot. However, the toe was way too pointy for me."
380854,1,"Hola Gente:Just great, for everything!! I used this boots to go to my job too.Saludos, Allan."
160868,1,I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes!
42363,0,"I got this on sale for a really good price. I have always been a fan of Adidas shoes but I thought I gave Converse a try for the good price. Currently, I also wear Adidas Team MAC 2, which I bought for a few dollars more than the Converse. The Team MAC 2 defnitely has much better feel and support, especially when landing after a jump. I have worn Nike, Reebok and other brands of basketball shoes of about the same price and the support provided by the Converse is only average. For example, the tongue of the Converse is thin while the Adidas is breathable mesh and much thicker. I feel like I am wearing a cheap, store brand basketball shoes with the Converse. Don't let the ICON system fool you, it doesn't do anything special and is no comparison to Adidas's AdiPRENE+, Torsion System and A3 Structure. In my opinion, Adidas has the best fit, feel and support for about the same price. I currently own 4 pairs of basketball shoes and one pair of running shoes. All are Adidas with A3 or AdiPRENE+. All are remarkably comfortable. I know, but they were all on sale for very low prices. So I stocked up."
320409,1,I purchased these in a size 4 for my eight year old son. He wears them everyday. They're lightweight and were comfortable right out of the box (no breaking in period). The price is ridiculously low for a pair of leather Adidas shoes.
283969,1,"Traditional style and ""feel"" (I wear these at home as slippers). Order up at least 1 1/2 sizes. You can adjust the fit using the elastic cord sewn in along the top. Detached straps to sew across the top if you'd like."
236741,1,these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym. they are lightweight and very comfortable
275049,1,"I am not an outdoor person nor a hiker. I work in IT and often walk a lot. I had the normal work shoes, even a pair of Dr. Schols. My feet around the balls of my feet HURT. It was to the point i was going to see a doctor as I felt like an old man. I decided to try these boots since all my walking was like hiking. This was more then I ever spent on a pair of shoes, but that pain was just too much. I began wearing these shoes and within a week I could feel the pain in feet going away. Now I am pain free and I wear the boots EVERYWHERE. Money well spent."
108866,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
184948,1,"We were very happy with this purchase. The shoe is perfectly represented in the pictures, quality was just as we expected from Stride Rite and shipping was quick. Thanks for another great experience."
384954,1,These are great. They are very durable and comfortable. I live a warm climate and wear these every day. My last pair lasted 2 years! Amazing for any sandal I have ever worn>
237965,1,"amigo mio gracias por el envio todo esta muy bien, muchas gracias y que pase muy bien y feliz d&iacute;as de los enamorados"
125086,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
144209,1,"I have been wanting the women's classic UGG boots for awhile and I finally treated myself to them. I knew that I would be very satisfied with my purchas and indeed I am!These boots are very comfortable, affordable, and cute for everyday wear. I would highly recommend them and will be purchasing another pair very soon.A girl can never have too many shoes!!"
143591,1,"Very comfortable, no break-in period necessary for me with this pair of shoes. Decent rubber with adequate traction. Good looks with boot treads for ladders and traction."
218876,1,I find it hard to get chuck taylors in size 12 in stores around my area. It was nice to see they had them here on amazon in a mulitple of styles at great prices. The shipping was faster than I could of imagined and I plan to order future products from this provider.
300159,1,"In general, I dislike the look of boaters. My husband, however, has been wearing boaters for years. He had been upgrading his boaters annually at a Dexter shop in Maine. When the shop closed down, he was left with beat up old shoes that were really no longer wearable. For Christmas, I decided to surprise my better half with a pair of these shoes. (For better or for worse!) After much research, I chose the Sebago Schooner in Brown Oiled Waxy. They arrived in a timely manner without complications and they looked great. My husband was very pleased. The 12 Wide fit my husband perfectly(he thought it might be too narrow but it wasn't) and he loves the quality of the leather and the craftsmanship. Some reviewers critized the quality of these shoes. I'll have to see how they hold up to the abuse I'm sure they'll fall victim to. For now, I highly recommend these to those who are seeking a classic, quality boat shoe. And the price is right!"
219696,1,I was extremely satisfied. The shipping was BEYOND fast! I got my shoes the next day.My husband has some old blue ones and I wanted to get him ones in black. I checked for his shoe size for Chuck's (since they tend to be a size or a size and a half longer then the normal shoe size).
267852,1,"i was hiking last sunday on the north east side of barbados, they protected my feet when i stepped the sea rocks along the shoreline.i used wear shoes and my feet are not longer wet i walked thru wet grass or i stepped into water.they are comfortable. i dont have worry about twristing my ankles no more or hurting my feet on jagged rocks.one hiking buddies stated that i must have on goat parts because he said, i was going very fast along the shoreline, sometime there was very little space for footing. i was going buy an other brand but when i saw them online, i wanted them! they are grrreeeaat!them light weight. before i bought the boots, i used wear a pair of running shoes and the rain comes or falls the night before! my feet would wet and will bring alot of discomforts to my feet but alas i have my htmaivwp hiking boots. they are great."
34124,1,These shoes are one of the most comfortable I have ever worn. They hold up very well. I have been buying them for years. It was great to find them on line because not every store carries them. I don't know why.
179790,1,"this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact. very very good"
205667,1,"So far I have ordered about 18 of these mostly for myself and 4 for my husband's Lucchese boots. They are well made and they do not have so many knot holes that you think they are made from swiss cheese. I have some very expensive boots, one pair of D & G that was 1920.00 here on Amazon These went directly into this pair of boots, also 5 pair of Ralph Lauren that cost from 1050.00 to 1353.53 each. The reason I am telling this is to let you know that I only put the best into these boots, and that is what I consider these boot trees. Make no mistate, I also use them in the lesser expensive boots. If you cannot find the size you want here on Amazon, then go to woodlore.com. Great product."
4087,1,This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.
350577,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
50307,1,"recived boots was very pleased with services and product.this is secondpair they are well made,and wear realy well"
114074,1,"I've never been much of one for fancy shoes. Sure, I love the way they look, but I end up wearing them once, then stowing them to the ever-growing stash in the bottom of my closet.When I bought this shoe in the blushing bride/heather color last fall from a catalog, I expected another candidate for that stack in my closet. A shoe with the playful, sporty, yet somehow feminine details of this one simply isn't practical...right?Then they came and I tried them on.I hate to admit it, but I am now a Puma athletic shoe addict. Every pair is sporty and trendy, yet has a classical styling that is somehow sophisticated and traditional. They work for me because they're pracitcal enough to go running in, but stylish enough to wear with jeans or a sporty minidress.There's not much else to say. These are the most comfortable cute shoes I've ever had, plain and simple. They are, by far, the most versatile shoes I've ever owned. BUY THEM!"
370671,1,"Since Nike bought Converse the have altered the shoe. There used to be an extra piece of stitched canvas on the inner part just below the big toe and stitching through the back heal of the canvas. The show is basically the same, except without this extra stitching and canvas they do not last as long."
281580,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
297175,1,"I sized down 0.5 sizes from 8.5 to 8.0 like many have suggested and found these Chukka's to fit really well. However, the leather is quite stiff in the first few wears and more persistent break-in may be required to get comfortable. The beeswax color begins kind of a uniform dark brown, but it has since really brightened with wear and some nice lighter colors are coming through.Overall a great boot, just be aware that they may be a bit stiff to start off."
207123,1,"love the color, love the texture, love the comfort.. have received many,many compliments.would recommend this product unconditionally. go for it!"
105587,1,"i wanted these because of the cute purple color - they also fit well, very comfy. sturdy and stylish. pretty expensive for a flip-flop but worth it for their ""shoe-like"" quality and for the cute color!"
170970,1,"I bought a discontinued (?) color on sale. This is a great shoe and very durable, good support,instant fit. This is my third pair. Tread lasts two plus years with regular use. I hope they keep making this shoe at the current quality, if so, they will have a loyal customer. I hope the color schemes aren't garish when I need my next pair! That's the only reason for the 4 rating, current colors schemes are ugly."
89314,1,These sandals arrived promply. They fit and feel great. The soles formed to my feet in a couple of days. They are an inexpensive way to buy Birkenstock-like products and are of the same quality. Don't be fooled by any bad reviews.
120062,1,"These moccasins are so comfortable and cute, I get so many compliments on them and they are so lovely to walk in. I highly recommend these and they look great with jeans."
58383,1,"They are the one pair of shoes you can't go wrong with. Wear them with shorts or jeans, always looks great!"
212161,1,"I have been buying Van Eli Women's Frankie Flat for years! They are not only chic but also so-o-o comfortable - AND they are available in many NEUTRAL colors, which is especially handy when I travel (I don't have to pack lots of different shoes). I continue to buy replacements as my 'old ones' wear out!! I hope this style is never discontinued!!!!"
343383,1,"The first time I tried a pair of the Grasshoppers jensen leather shoes(slip-on) my feet fell in love with it ...I left the store with the shoes on and since then on any other pair of shoes I wear don't feel as confortable . I wear my Grasshoppers everyday ( this is my fifth pair ). I wear them to go to work, on my days off to go to the supermarket or shopping, when I go on vacation and lately even on some social ocasions. I just wish they would come on some other colors to match different outfits. Here is my suggestion: brown and taupe."
105696,1,"I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it"
112309,1,"I bought these for my daughter around the time she was learning to walk (about 1 year) and we LOVED them. They are extremely comfortable for babies learning to walk and perfect to wear around the house or at daycare, etc. She even wore them outside in the grass or sidewalk, though I would not recommend them in the snow, rain or on gravel or dirt. These are by far my favorite shoes for babies- a thousand times better than the hard soled shoes. We definitely got our money's worth on these!"
351127,0,"I read super reviews, and wanted the best, so I bought these. I am quite disappointed, actually. I am a girl, maybe that made the difference. The toe cap rubbed my toes something fierce. The soles are super, I loved that about them. But they are really heavy and I clump everywhere. This has not changed in 2 months. I have strong legs, so this is not a weakness issue. They have a bit of a pointed toe, too. I do not think these are sexy, on me or anyone else. Danner has been nice enough about my issues, but I forsee a lot of money continuing with these. For standing long periods, these are probably great. But I will have to run, walk and try to be stealthy. Forget it with these! Maybe in a year or two, they will be quieter? I tried to buy American, but these are just not that great. Sorry.. I see that another man has said the same things, now that I re-read the reviews. I will try to walk through a river, or let the sun soften them. I hope it helps, otherwise I just flushed over $300./04/2012 Amazon gave me a full refund, as apparently these were defective. The toe box killed my toe and when they realized it was a defect and not preference, they fully refunded my money. They treated me like they wanted to keep my business. Good customer service!So, I guess these have the potential to be great boots, like others seem to think they are. Just keep in mind that they are heavy. The pros are that they are very easy on and off, well made, and the sole is very comfortable and protective. My feet felt well cared for."
140111,1,"These are the best. So comfortable. I cannot remember how many pairs of these I have purchased and worn out. Have them in colors, too. Especially get compliments on the blue ones."
246156,1,THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SHOE. EVERYBODY NOTICED THEM WHEN I WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. COMFORTABLE TOO. I STAYED IN THEM ALL DAY AND MY FEET NEVER GOT TIRED. A GREAT VALUE.
268906,1,My Dad has very flat and painful feet. He has had quite a few surgeries on his feet. He says these shoes are so comfortable they are like slippers. That is high praise from him. At 87 comfort is very important to him. I highly recommend these shoes.
294421,1,I love these boots they are perfect for my six year old. They are durable and I love the darker color so the dirt does not show as much. The price was great and shipping was fast
163331,2,The shoes are really cute and would probably work for a child who is 4 or 5 but for anyone smaller the elastic strap just doesn't hold the foot in the shoe like it should...the shoe would be far better with a buckle or a velcro closure...the elastic was just too stretchy and my daughter's foot would slip out making the shoe unwearable and in my opinion even a little dangerous.
73635,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
199253,1,"Timberland is Timberland!.. quality, design and usefull.In this case the design is very classic but it was what I looking for"
11689,1,"I have had these boots for about 2 years, I have hiked through the woods, dug 4' deep ditches in hard clay, and I take several motorcycle trips every year. I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape. After all this I just polished them with kiwi parade gloss shoe polish to a mirror finish that would make your drill instructor proud (not an exaggeration they do take a good polish). Before I got these boots I went through about two pair of shoes a year, these boots are so tough that they will easily last for another 2 years. I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years, and for the price cannot be beat. I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off, they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use."
358162,1,"Capezio Women's Jr. Footlight Character Shoe,Black,9 M US . The shoes were a Christmas gift and the recipient loves them. They are a comfortable fit and the heel is the right height for those mid-high heel lovers. The shoe is quality made and is as pictured."
313431,1,"These boots worked perfectly for my son. They are very well made. They are a great color. They are a little heavy, but that's probably because of the sturdy construction. He has worn them several times already. I would recommend these boots."
377023,2,"THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET AND AMAZON DOES NOT CARE, THEIR ANSWER IS TO SEND IT BACK AND IN 4 WEEKS THEY WILL RETURN YOUR MONEY. IT IS EASIER FOR THEM TO LOSE CUSTOMERS THAN FOR THEM TO FIX THIS AD. WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ORDER THIS SHOE IS A PAIR OF WESTERN CHIEF STEEL TOED BOOT, WHEN YOU ORDER THE BOOT YOU GET THIS SHOE, OF COURSE THERE IS THE SERIOUS DIFFERENCE IN PRICE, IF THE SHOE IS WHAT YOU WANT, HOWEVER IF IT IS THE BOOT THAT YOU WANT YOU WILL BE GETTING A BARGAIN, IT IS QUITE A NICE BOOT, IT IS NOT HOWEVER THIS SHOE!!!!!!!After throwing several fits and screaming at several people I see they have changed the pictures on the shoes and western chief steel toed 8"" boot, they have also lowered the price on both, so if you want to chance it it is up to you, however, I still have not gotten the right item."
224447,1,muy bien lo que se esperaba y en el tiempo estimado 100 % recomendado muy buena la compra del articulo
192139,1,"Excellent product!!! I've got it for my three children twice. Soft, comfortable, wearable in many occasions, for girls and boys."
325517,1,"GET YOUR STREET SIZE. Then the shoes will be perfect. They squeek on hard tile and plastic floors, but hopefull that's because they're new. Nice and flexible. They come in a cool box. Great for the price. They look cheap in the picture, but they work great for me. Dance away, people, dance away!"
336855,1,Bought as a replacement for kid brother. Item as describe! Size is true and recommended for teens since shoe does not go out of style.
255648,1,These fit great! My neice loves them and she always want to wear them. I couldn't beat this price any where.
368871,1,I have always been. Big Vans fan. I never owned the classics but after buying them I love them. Really comfortable and are made much better than other company's shoes that are made to look like vans.
46295,0,Shoe looks great but the size I ordered ran small. I bought about 6 pair of sandles this year and all fit well but they were bought at the store and I tried them on. These were the same size but were just a little small.
293839,1,"These are amazing shoes and I recommend them to anyone who is considering an aggressive shoe. A bit painful, but it's to be expected"
270712,1,"I got these and another pair in a different color for my father as an early Christmas present. While he said that the sole of one of the slippers was a little slippery, he refused to allow me to send them back for a replacement!THese aren't exactly what I thought they were (I have ordered similar slippers for Dad in the past), but Dad seems happy with them and that's what's important."
290585,1,I'm using this shoe now because it is easy to get on. I prefer the world class walking shoe by rockport but it is harder to get on for me.
306016,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
383362,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
225234,1,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
190752,0,"I bought this for my cousin a while ago. It's a cute purse that can really touch up an outfit, but the chain from the side is a bit awkward. Also, the material is wearing off very quickly. Other than those two things, it's pretty nice for the price. It's also very roomy and is pretty big, it was bigger than I had expected but that's okay. Oh I also found a similar purse that I prefer more from Forever 21 for about the same price. It's called ""Quilted Faux Leather Crossbody""."
301024,1,Absolutely love these really cute boots. Bought them as a gift for a friend's son for Xmas and they look awesome. Sizing was perfect and the price was good as well.
89015,1,These shoes are the best. They are very comfortable and the ribbons make them very versitile. A must have!!!
251271,1,"Absolute great!!! This will be my third pair. Comfortable, last years, I wear them almost everyday-year round. Retailer was great too. Great price and they actually arrived earlier than I excpected."
257770,1,"Positively order these a size to large. I wear size 12 shoes, as other reviewers suggested, I ordered size 13. I could have even ordered 2 sizes but they'll do, as they will stretch some. Very quick shipping, unlike some other items I have ordered. They are nice slippers, warm.. just nice."
314641,1,"I bought a pair of the Clarks Sunbeat Adjustable Sandals when I had a terrible swelling problem with my feet. At the time, they were the only shoes I could wear. They have a nice support and adjustable straps for comfort. They are also quality shoes that hold up good with wear. I have had no problem, whatsoever, with them."
254415,1,Its a black K-Swiss tennis shoe. This is a classic unisex style. I bought them for my 3 year old daughter. She loves them because daddy got em for her. I think I might get a pair for my self actually.Oh..and a pair for the wife too (maybe)
3213,1,"I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
371692,1,"I love my new sneakers! They're great for hiking, running and just for hanging out. Very fashinable."
49541,1,"Great comfort and quality. I've had this shoe for a few months now. First time I tried it on I noticed a serious improvement in my enjoyment and energy for the run. Great cushioning, although this is a very light shoe --- fit for racing, not for training."
4721,1,"I run a lot as part of a running group, and whenever I do intervals or fartlek training, I wear these. They feel so light that whenever I lift my feet I feel barefoot. I also wear the Brooks Launch, which are also light, but there is no comparison. The only reason I don't wear these 100% of the time when running, is that I want more cushioning when running more than 10K at a time at a pace slower than 5:15min per kilometer, but I may also start wearing these for these runs too. Again, this is perfect as long as you have no pronation, and do not need extra cushioning. I am on my second pair and could not be happier."
193026,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
548,1,"As most of the other reviews state, these are nice boots - both in looks and quality - for the price. I compared these boots directly with the more expensive Timberland White Ledge boots. I was disappointed with the Timberlands' cheap materials and construction. The Hi-Tec boots are clearly superior.However, if you have wide feet and order the wide model, know that you will not receive true wide (i.e. EE or W sizes) boots. Unlike the properly wide Timberlands, the wide version of the Hi-Tec boots are only slightly wider than a medium width set of shoes.The only other complaint I have for these boots is that they lack loops on the back to help slip them on/off.As for sizing, I find these boots comparable with Nike's sizing or 1/2 size bigger than New Balance or Timberland, e.g. Hi-Tec boots sized 9.5 are about 9.5 Nike, 9 New Balance, or 9 Timberland.If you need properly wide boots, I recommend Merrell as they accommodate wide feet very well."
228191,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
113623,1,This is a must for bike riders. It doesn't slip and it is good to change gears.
291615,1,Boots are great my 4 year old absolutely loved them. I would definitely purchase again. This was a great Christmas Gift
199422,1,"Comfortable, well made shoe that is great for everyday casual use.Availability in different widths is a big plus!Used for school... popular with teens.A bit expensive... hard to find sales on this popular shoe."
353054,1,"They're not much to look at, but these boots are among the most comfortable I've ever warn. From day one, without any breaking-in. They show every sign of being as robust and durable as claimed, too, though I have so far had little opportunity to put that to the test. Definitely worth the money."
260070,0,Active duty Army. These boots have been used hard for about 6 months and held up however the rubber sole has sine gone flat and I have lost considerable tread under the balls of my feet.
65515,0,"If you want an average work boot,this is your boot. Want a real work boot get ROCKY."
57300,1,"Love these leather oxfords ! I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening, no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces. They have no insoles but are comfy as is, flat shoes as what was described. I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon ! Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re: an exchange. I will buy again from them as I also bought the eyelet oxfords as well many times5 stars on this item, will DEFINITELY buy this one again. Great shoePS this picture shows a black or navy canvas shoe NOT the awesome white leather ones i bought"
237854,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
245733,1,"I've been wearing Skechers's Alley Cats for 5 years now, I haven't worn a different shoe on a regular basis since, If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Alley Cats provide the comfortability I need throughout the day, and the style and design are awesome and rugged. For me, nothing beats a pair of alley cats to wear all day long. I wear them almost every single day and they don't start to tear or rip until minimum a year later. Great value for the money !"
309315,1,"These are well-made boots and wide enough to be comfortable on my feet. The top is slightly narrow, so they will be snug on my calves. Great quality for the price."
282719,1,"These came, as advertised, and in less time than was predicted. Great seller, Great product! Would work with them again in the future."
88141,0,"Color`s good. Style`s good. Only problem is-and this is kind of a big problem-the sizing is all wrong. My previous crocs were a size M10/W12, and they fit perfectly. So when I ordered these new ones, I ordered size M10-11/W12-13, thinking that, like all companies, they would start skimping on the sizing once they hit the big time to try and save on costs. I guess I should`ve ordered M12/W14. My feet have definitely not grown two whole sizes in the past two years."
57714,1,I purchased these for my daughter. We actually had a hard time finding these in any store where we live. Delivery was timely and item was as described.
314586,0,"I've owned two pairs of these boots. Hiking boots are my normal work attire. I'm in the office behind a computer one day and perhaps the next day out in the roughs. I've worn them in 100-degree weather and also when the ground was frozen. So, I've given both pairs a good test. I should still be on my first pair - instead, both pairs have cracked just behind the rubber toe guard, on the inside part of the foot. First a crack and then both pairs broke all the way through. If the first pair had not cracked, I would still be wearing them and that would make for quite a good testimony. If the second pair had held up, I would have given the first pair the benefit of the doubt. They will not, I think, blow out on a 20-mile hike; instead it is a slowly deteriorating process over time and while you can see it coming, it cannot be reversed. This a fine boot, a good stable platform, but it needs a modification right at that stress point. Until then, for me, these boots are not a good investment. Also, moisture collects under the foot insert and forms droplets on the hard ""rubber"" insole. It's a problem."
199044,1,These shoes are teriffic. This is going to be my 5th pair.They surround your foot with cushioning and when you walk the air chamber in the bottom of your shoes is like floating along the floor. If you have to be on your feet just a shift readjusts the cushioning helping your feet from hurting a lot longer than any other shoe I have ever had.Great Shoe!!
240789,0,"It thought these would be loafers, but they're not. They are more like moccasins. The material is super soft. They are comfortable, but they feel and look more like slippers."
253263,1,The best shoe I've ever owned. I love them and will buy more in the future. Along with Levi's these never go out of style...at least as far as I'm concerned.
158297,1,"I brought this for a gift to my brother and he's very happy, his really a good shoes!!!"
172206,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
290130,1,"I picked these up in Leopard Microfiber to go with a special outfit, they were inexpensive and serve their purpose, they are great looking but you shouldn't expect a real luxury quality item for this kind of price. That said I'm happy with the purchase.My one complaint is that they had a very, very strong odor right out of the box that took nearly a week to dissipate. I assume that it's from the adhesive they used to glue the microfiber fabric to the shoe, it was an adheisve smell, but it's gone now, so no big deal, just be prepared to let them air out for a couple days if you run into this problem."
30229,0,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves."
246336,1,Love the Rivas. Bought at $10 less than anywhere else I could find. Fast delivery and shoes arrived perfectly.
152971,2,Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam??
33817,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
312607,1,This boot is not only elegant looking but it is very comfortable to walk around with. I was afraid of buying them without trying them on first but now that I have them I consider it's been one of the best boot purchases I've made. I also got them in black.
12102,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
300508,1,I bought these for my rowdy 3 year old and he loves them. They are not too heavy and they are also wide enough for his feet.
189983,1,"I have been buying this shoes for my step son for over 3 years now. They are a classic shoe that hold up very well for boys. Great for school/ uniform shoes and true to size. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a stylish, affordable shoe for a boy."
388231,1,"TROOP Footwear is back for the 2k3 and they are hot. These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
20312,1,"These are the only shoes my husband will wear. He says they are comfortable and they hold up well. When they get too scuffed up, he wears them for his everyday shoes and he buys another pair."
181288,1,"I bought these to replace a pair that I got over 15 years ago. That pair, BTW, was still in good condition except that the rubber sole had cracked and worn out. (I was able to have them re soled with a local rubber sole as the uppers were still very good and comfortable).The new shoes are identical to the old ones in terms of appearance. However, they seem to be a bit tight width wise, though this is probably due to the fact that they are new and need to be broken in a bit.These are THE classic boat shoe, recommended for everyone!!!"
137119,1,"I ordered these shoes for a wedding, yeah I know, and paid the extra twenty bucks to have them shipped 2day air. They went from the East coast to the Midwest, and were five miles from my house on Friday, but UPS charges extra to deliver on Saturday. If I had known there would be an extra charge, I would have paid it, but wasn't given the option. The shoes arrived on Monday, the day after the wedding. I emailed the company to voice my displeasure, and was informed that I actually received them before I was supposed to! My advice, great shoes, great prices, just make sure you plan ahead."
75673,1,"Great shoes for $25....made out of some kind of plastic, but really comfortable and well made....I would them again in another color."
216068,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
132700,0,"The size runs small. My daughter wears a size 6 in shoes so I ordered a 6 in this shoe too, however it was way too small. Couldn't even get on her foot. It seems a 6 in this shoe is equivalent to her other size 4 shoes.The quality seems good though if you how their sizes run."
192814,1,"Love these . . . I am so glad I purchased these sneakers! They are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. They look great with sweatsuits, jeans or shorts. It's a sporty sneaker which boosts a clean and neat appearance. You will need to shimmy your foot into the footbed. Not a big deal at all, and only takes a few seconds.I do recommend purchasing one half size larger then your normal size. I find that Skechers run a bit small. I always get them a half size larger and the fit as been right on."
212316,1,"The shoes arrived in a timely fashion, and they are perfect for me because of my pronation problem. I need to buy about 4 pairs per year because of my right ankle collapsing so this is a very quick and easy way for me to order exactly what I need on a regular basis. Thank you!"
388822,1,"The crown jewel of every shoe for a suit is an oxford cap toe. Over the years, Johnston & Murphy's Melton is STILL a quality, good looking shoe to wear with your suit or blazer/trouser combo."
293631,1,I purchased these in white for my husband for work. He has to wear a white shoe. I have a problem finding a narrow shoe that fits snug so his foot doesn't slide and move all day long. He works ten plus hours a day. He was very happy with the fit and comfort of this shoe. The price was fantastic. We are both pleased with this shoe and it seems to be an attractive and durable product. We will be buying more Brooks Shoes in the near future.
236141,0,"they look really nice and feel soft but the back of the shoe cuts into the back of your foot, even after the first day they are almost unbearable. They look so cute it's sad to see them go to waste."
51248,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
193465,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
177165,2,"Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever. Decided to try a pair again (am over 60 now) but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet. What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning! Converse, are you listening?"
310502,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
141953,1,"Wonderful product, great quality! I just can't say enough about how much we love them! If you are on the fence about getting these, do it, you will not be disappointed!"
262669,1,It is exactly as described on the post. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend the product if you like converse products of course
223653,1,"These are great boots for the bad weather. They have great traction, and are water proof. If I had a &#34;con&#34; with the boots, it would have to be the inner sole. It's a bit thin. That can be fixed with a third party sole you can get on the cheap from a Wal-Mart or any store."
5169,1,"Shoes arrived in original box; pristine condition; exactly what I ordered.HOwever, we ordered the wrong size. Return was handled well; account to be credited for purchase price only. No shoes in stock in the size we needed, and it would be spring before any more arrived. When you see your size, order it ASAP."
319192,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
113468,1,These weather overshoes are perfect to use while walking in the rain. I buy the larger size for comfortable fit over my usual shoe size.
78642,1,I looove these shoes. They are supper comfy and match with pretty much anything. You can get cheaper rip off ones at target or payless but they have ugly childish disgnes on them and get damaged allot easier.
203881,1,These are the most comfortable flip flops. The top is fabric so it's not irritating and the bottom is thicker than your average so your feet are cushioned when you walk outside. I had an old pair that lasted over 10 years. Love these.
6662,1,"These are great shoes to wear without socks, jump on your boat, and cruise around the suburbs."
203649,1,"Great style. feel good and fit well. Quality leather, good stiching, quality heal and sole with smooth finish. Will buy again in future."
225490,1,When I got the chucks I started to train capoeira and I felt like I was stylin and profilin wwwooooo
57068,1,I love my new red keds!!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing!! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color!
328961,1,Very good product. My sister is happy with them. I recommend other women to try.
105331,0,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
196936,1,"very good boots, they do run almost 1 size too big. I wear size 12 in most of my Nike's and Vans, ordered these in 11,5 and still are a bit big, but I think that 11 would be too small. Overall a very good quality product!"
368650,1,"This is the third par of the Minnetonka driving Moc I've had in the last 15 years. They've changed the bumps on the boton to litle tiny ones, but all in all, a great shoe. FAR less expensive than a Cole-Han, Trask, or such, and you don't get that much more in those Moccasins costing 3 times as much. These are structured with nice, solid leather, not all soft like an around the cain version. GOOD PRODUCT!"
270471,1,"I have owned some form of this shoe for many years. Due to some painful foot issues, there are very few shoes that I can wear comfortably, and these are probably my favorite. I wear these almost every workday and I do a decent amount walking during the day. I wish they would last a little longer... I tend to get a new pair every 8 months or so. I find they usually wear out at the top inside of the heel (Achilles Notch) or the rubber starts separating from the sole. Since they are not super expensive, I am willing to re-buy them because they are really super comfortable."
45970,0,"I though this was a comfortable shoe that's why I bought it but it really stiff in the arches that every time I go walking in it my feet hurt but maybe i just have weak arches it's kind of lose in the heels but maybe i bought it too wide, hopefully it gets comfortable after a while."
54298,0,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
298057,1,"These shoes from Clarks are decent looking and very comfortable... They are not top-of-the-line, but a great value at these prices ($30)"
309039,2,"Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing."
385247,1,My daughter loves these shoes. Her favorite pair and wants me to buy her another pair.
329622,1,"My sister turned me onto these a few years ago and I love them. I have a couple pairs of them and they are, in my opinion, the perfect summer shoe. Confortable to wear and let your feet breathe! If they get dirty, just throw them in the wash.They last a long time!! I have been wearing mine a lot and they are still going strong. My husband, who likes to hike in his and wore the bottoms off, sent them to the factory to get a replacement sole. They came back looking brand new!These shoes are a great investment. You will love them!"
227945,1,"I love my Converse Chucks! glad a picked grey, goes with alot of stuff. I usually wear a 9 or 8& half n my chucks fit fine :) happy with my purchase!"
338849,1,The Chuck Taylor converse I ordered from AMAZON meet all my expectations.It is comfortable on my feet and i wear it everyday.
141526,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."
5181,1,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
27649,1,"I am an aspiring theater actress in graduate school and I needed some character shoes for rehearsing.The heel is a perfect height. I am used to wearing higher heels for 'going out' but these are great for acting, dancing, and moving in. They give you enough height to feel like a heel, but are low enough so you can actually do some REAL work. Sometimes high heels hurt and disconnect you from the much needed 'grounded' feeling when working.They are really comfortable, break in nicely, and are great for auditioning.They are a tad narrow so if you have wide feet opt for a wider size.I LOVE my Capezios!!!"
71132,0,Not especially well made. Doesn't necessarily stretch were needed. It didn't stretch well towards the toes as needed. Poor quality screw.
137592,1,I ordered the wrong size shoe and talk about ease and no worry return and order of correct size. I know no matter what I order from AMAZON.COM my transaction will be easy and I will be completely satisfied. I like that since I hate shopping. Amazon.com makes it easy to shop and the prices cannot be beat. I will use Amazon.com for everything I need. I also feel safe using a credit card online knowing Amazon.com protects my information.
136763,1,"The Last time I wore a pair of these, my codename was Roadrunner, fastest boy in the universe...lol.I bought these more for the nostalgiathan anything else.I have no complaints"
248222,1,They were very nice slippers but I didn't need two pair. And they were too wide for me.
94309,0,"I have owned Propet Walkers before and was willing to go the extra money to purchase another pair. They are good at support. My one disappointment was that they were listed as ""wides"" and they don't seem very wide at all. The tongue is thick and adds to the difficulty of getting the straps all they way across."
212968,1,"I love my Carolina Crocs! I live in Nairobi, Kenya, and they are the talk of our campus! It's great to be able to support the Tar Heels from head to toe, literally!I am wondering, however, about the return policy. I was not credited with a full refund for the pair of shoes that I returned, and I am curious as to why that is. I am grateful for any refund, but was just wondering why only a partial one.Thanks for the great product!Lisa Orr"
227343,1,"I ordered these in the Grey color. Just be forewarned, they are much more of a tan/taupe color than the dove-grey I was hoping for-- but they are still super cute and will match anything. They look pretty much like the photo in color.These also feel sturdier than Chucks I've had in the past."
132523,1,She loved them - They were just like the shoes the real ballerinas wear. She put them on immediately and wore them all day. Nice leather bottoms.
307694,1,"Chuck Taylor Converse All-Star shoes are, by far, the best shoes you could ever have the pleasure of slipping your feet into each day! I own three high rise (black, pink, orange), and two low rise (green, red), and if you are in indecision about getting a pair, GET THEM! Whether you get the All-Stars or the skateboard style, you will NOT regret your decision! You can see them all at www.conversegallery.com, so check it out! These shoes are incredibly durable, and provide comfortable ankle support, making it easy to move aroung as fast as you want; you have to keep up with the shoes, not vice versa! These are basketball shoes, so they are great for running, basketball, soccer, and sport you could think of! Or, they could be just casual shoes. Another wonderful feature is that they are uni-sex, so guys and girls can wear them! Converse All-Stars RULE!"
204783,1,love love love love love love love love love this!!!! i will buy some every year love timberland products for my ruff little boy!!
343416,1,"She loves Grasshoppers, and she just loves these! She says they are very comfortable and last forever. She has been buying Grasshoppers for many years and says there is nothing out there like them!"
64854,1,"very cheap for Keds, fits excellent, got it really fast in two days, i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything. Totally worth it:)"
335948,1,"I have tons of colors in these -- so well-made, comfortable, durable, and just throw them in the washer. Yes, ugly. Oh well."
225626,1,this is my first time buying from amazon and it was a great experience. with 3-5 day shipping they came in 3 days. the shoes are great of course. this is my third pair of converse so i knew what to expect. they were in perfect condition when i received them. definitely don't hesitate to buy!
255870,1,"I already own a black pair, and for someone with lifetime feet problems, these are the most comfortable shoes I own. I'll be buying a another pair in a different color soon."
258546,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
5292,1,"Very Fast! I had the item within 2 days of placing the order, color and size correct. I was very pleased with the service."
50181,1,"I received them very quickly, they fit great, solid heel, soft and kind of stretchy upper, really sexy!"
341134,1,"I love these shoes! I had one pair and used them so much I was dreading having to get rid of the so I searched to find another pair since I had bought these so long ago, I was afraid they wer no longer available. Not only did I find them at amazon, but they were on sale and available with prime shipping. Need I say more. Ok maybe I will. They are comfortable and the patent leather on the top only dresses them up just enough but not too much."
50405,1,These are fantastic! Great fit and wonderful to wear. I plan on buying more in all colors later. It is very hard to find shoes that fit me but these fit amazingly.
96963,1,"I'm very happy with the shoes, although I find they run a little small, so I had to return the first pair. I'm using them for crossfit, particularly when doing lifts. I don't particularly like running in them, however, as they aren't the squishy running shoes I'm used to."
110458,0,"I bought a pair of the 500 blunstones about 2-3 yrs ago. I've loved them - they are really comfortable, look well, nice leather uppers. Unfortunately this year on pulling them out of storage for winter the soles were cracking and falling off. The cobbler I brought them to said this is a common problem unless they are worn all the time - they dry out in storage and then crack. Also they cannot be fixed as they are completely rubber - there is nothing to stitch/glue a new sole onto.:(Sadly I probably won't be buying them again unless this problem is fixed."
109899,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
258336,1,I followed recommendations from others who reviewed this product before me and ordered one size bigger. I didn't regret my decision. Those shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Definitely well worth the money and a great purchase for someone who just started.
69751,1,"I purchased a pair of these boots over a year ago for my job as a local Mall Guard. I wanted steel toe protection just in case i had to break up a fight and some kid would try to step on my foot. Turned out the steel toe was unnessicary. What I can say was this boot held up resonably well under the conditions i put it through. I walked over 5 miles a day on a hard tile floor at first for 5 days a week then for 3 when i went to nights. these boots held up. After over a year and a half the front foot tread area is compleatly flat. the tread is worn compleatly off, at the back i have a large heel bevel but when i think about how much i walked with them on. Just to let you know the velvet ease comfort insole installed in the boot will flatten out in no time and your going to have to come up with one on your own, also its not really water proof. Just to let everyone know its a B.A Mason boot at a higher price, I got mine for 109 out of the Mason Catalog and thats what its really worth. Also it's Made In China and they have the nerve to call it work america. So to sum up It's a good boot thats going to do what an old school work boot was made to do, Its nothing fancy but it will do its job. Better Yet its cheap enough that when you wear em out you can toss em and get another pair. The only problem is the lack of padding and a very hard rubber sole. But of corse a cushion insole can fix that. Also they have a padded collar at the top to keep the leather from eating your ankle. I can attest to this i beat the crap out of mine and they held up. Another Nice feature is they do come in narrow B widths. If you cant find em here head on over to B.A Mason"
298997,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
122774,0,I purchased these in a 7.5 wide but when I got them they didn't feel like a wide shoe even though that is what it said on the box. Better to buy shoes in person I guess.
347270,1,I bought these as a gift for my son. The sizing was spot on. He loves them. They are apparently very popular nowadays!
368922,1,"I LOVE THESE VANS! they look so sick and skate well, though not very durable considering the canvas.but packaging was great and was delivered sooner then expected ordered it monday and got it thurday.Great service awesome shoe"
262420,1,"A friend of mine recently has surgery on her heel to remove bone spurs. Her doctor told her that for the type of work that she does( on concrete 10 hrs a day) that the New balance was the best shoe that she could get to keep her feet from hurting. The doctor told her that the higher the number the better the shoe, so I bought a pair and my feet still hurt but there is a big difference between these and other name brands that I do not want to mention. I also, work on concrete and 10 to 11 hours a day. My feet, back and legs don't hurt as much as they used too."
309750,1,These shoes feel just like wearing a pair of slippers. They are the most comfortable shoes i own.
364164,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
38962,1,"The shoes feel rigid for a while when new, but with some time they conform to a very comfortable fit. They are durable and last well, and at a very good price. You will need to replace the laces within the first year of every day use. For any kind of shoe, I also recommend at least a thin sole insert to increase the longevity of the inside sole."
343798,1,"Could not love them any more if I tried! Perfect fit, perfect color, perfect delivery. I especially loved being able to get a half size, which is often hard to do with Converse."
371171,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
30986,1,"I almost always wear a size 13 shoe, and as such, I ordered a size 13 for these. They arrived, and yet they're a size or so too big, which I found strange.As for the shoes themselves, I do rather enjoy them. They look nice, slip on easily, and are comfortable, but again, I usually wear a size 13, ordered a size 13, and yet they're too big.I wanted to exchange them for a size 12, but those are now out of stock, so away they go for a refund.:("
143818,1,"The color's a little strange, but I bought them for working out in the Wellness Center at work, and they're excellent shoes for that purpose at an amazing price."
26553,0,I liked these shoes....they were very cute! But I had to return them only because my class offered us free shoes....or else I would have kept these. I'm giving them 3 stars because I did not like the return process. They made me pay for shipping when I returned them back to them.
42898,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
140854,1,"I forgot how shapely the legs look when wearing Dr. Scholl's! There's a slight hump underneath the base of the second toe which forces the wearer to grip the hump while walking. Va va va voom!!!!!!! Too bad we can't still go to the local drug store, plop down ten bucks, ditch the box and walk away with a great pair of sandals and legs to die for."
31391,1,"I bought these for my granddaughter who just turned one and is just starting to walk. She is fascinated by the fuchsia color. Watching her toddle around in them was too cute! They are so much lighter than her other shoes and she never tried to take them off. She is always trying to get her other shoes off. I was afraid they might fall off as she was walking but they stayed on even when she sat down and when she got back up. She wears a size 4 shoe and I ordered a size 4-5 and they are just right for her. Even though the strap isn't tight to her foot they stay on. She has a little room to grow and is wearing them with socks right now, but when the weather gets warmer...no more socks. I'm going to get her some more colors and these will be her main footwear for the summer. Grammy is going to try to get some to match. She's still too young to be humiliated by that!"
388155,1,"I bought my first pair of these last summer and wore them almost every day because they go with everything and fit about any occasion. This May I took them on a trip where, unfortunately, they were stolen along with the rest of my luggage. I just received my replacement pair and it feels like coming home. Great shoes, great fit, and super comfortable. Well worth the dollars."
165742,1,"I love Stacy Adams shoes. They are all stylish and of great quality. This shoe looks great, just make sure you know your size"
367876,0,"The black version of the Itasca SeaRay Slides arrived on time and in a box. They fit and are moderately comfortable. For the $30 or so shipped, they are about what i would expect. But, these are not some deeply discounted irregulars or end of line, though they may actually be. The are worth the $24.99. The smell of rubber was dominant when i opened up the box. there is no more than a flat piece of thin material separating the rubber from the removable insert. They are light and do fit comfortably but do not , by any means compare to the other higher line mocs that happen to go on some drastic sale and if i am lucky enough to find my size at the same time they go on sale-once every 3years. maybe. So, these seemed to be ok out of the box. i am wearing them and went for a walk without them breaking down and without getting any blisters. They do have a nice back for the achilles tendon and some foam in it with a center portion cut down for easier entry and removal, not much support but a nicer addition. there are elastic gores on each side with very little stretch to them but fine. my size was on target.the only real issue was that these were no way first quality or regular. there are glue spots all over the toe and fronts of both shoes. not little ones but sizable and 4 on one shoe and a couple on the other. they do not come off. At first , i thought it was only dust from shipping or a shelf storage. only it didnt come off with a light brushing nor with some water on a cloth. For me, it isnt a big deal because i always spill something i am cooking on my new shoes the first time i wear them anyway. I cant help it, always have, I used to cook for a living and now for amusement so am used to having a couple of oil spots on everything. Some people might be put off by the glue drips. I dont really mind but would normally want to be the one who gets the first spots or stains on my shoes (or shirts) thinking that this time I will keep them in perfect shape for more than a day.For the price i paid ,no problem, had i paid the 'full price' listed on the screen of $60, i would have returned them today-the day i got them."
71698,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S.

228619,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylor's since the varsity issued them in High School. I wear a half size (can't get them @ the mall). Amazon had my size & color selection (this is the third pair I've bought-I'm still playing). Everything else (convenience, getting the order right, getting them delivered quickly, etc.) was excellent. I'll buy @ Amazon again."
69559,1,"The Crocs are excellent, great size, and perfect. Shipped in timely manner. I would recommend buying from this seller. Top notch."
121578,1,My boyfriend really loves these sandals. He said that they were the most comfortable sandal he has worn as well as easy to break in. He normally wears Birkenstocks so I got these for him as a change up. I have been wearing Reef sandals for about 6 years and I just love them...they last forever.
52337,1,The shoe seems to be a quality shoe but I bought it too wide. My fault but I needed shoes so didn't send them back.
171100,1,Wow ~ this shoe is great! It is comfortable and they give my feet plenty of air so no sweating problem. Nice support for being on my feet all day and they look nice with slacks too. The best I have ever bought. I am here on Amazon to purchase another pair!!
141999,1,I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide. I'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair.
365480,1,"I've been wearing the black, classic low converse for several years now and it came that time I needed a replacement pair. Beals Florida shipped it faster than the other items I had ordered from Amazon that same day. Was definitely worth it for the price, and of course the shoes are one of life's little necessities for some of us."
258299,0,"I love the look of these shoes, but when I got them the clear band was too narrow for my feet. I haven't worn them and I probably will just give them to a friend or family member."
346337,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
297741,1,"I bought these shoes this week. I shattered my ankle last fall and have had trouble finding shoes that will allow for swelling and stilll look like something you would wear to work... These shoes are cute, comfortable and adjustable for the swelling. I have had some trouble with rubbing on the heel. Would recommend them."
126013,0,But I have wide feet so I can't wear them. I'm going to give them to my mom.
367303,1,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
168778,1,"I find my stability walker sneakers very comfortable, true to size but also including the extra toe space that I need with heavier winter sox. I'm delighted with them."
20925,1,These are the most comfortable shoes if you are on your feet all day. They look good and fit so well.
363247,1,In my opinion those are very good looking and comfortable shoes. And it is a good price too.
304022,1,"best shoes i've bought. Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person, keeps your heel stable and supports. Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight.New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there, and in wide sizes. Highly recommended..."
171192,1,Great fit. I have a short but wide foot and these fit wonderfully - 7WW - even with socks. Very comfortable. I would recommend. Will order in other colors.
199976,1,"I really like this shoe. I ordered my normal shoe size, 12, and they fit great. Fit is a little snug at first, but stretch out very quickly. Like most soccer type shoes they're made narrow. This shoe is all leather so it is a little warm in hotter weather. This shoe has a classic look of Sambas, but a lot more cushioning. I wear these shoes casually."
50258,1,"recived boots was very pleased with services and product.this is secondpair they are well made,and wear realy well"
344608,0,"The shoe that I received looked fine, but it did not fit as well as the one it replaced that I purchased in a brick and mortar store. It seemed a bit larger. I did not realize until I had worn it out a few times that the width was W (wide) and not M (medium) the size that I ordered. I will keep them and hope that with socks they will be ok. I have never ordered shoes by mail, because I did not want to have to go through the return process if something was not right. Unfortunately, it happened the first time and I didn't even realize that the order was filled incorrectly. This order was not fulfilled by Amazon, but by Shoebuy. I buy a lot from Amazon and will continue. Though, I do not think I will buy clothes or shoes by mail anymore."
79732,1,"And still going strong! I live in Florida so these bad boys have been on my feet every single day standing up to concrete, sand, rocks and slippery surfaces. They haven't ripped, torn, or discolored. If these ever fall apart I will definitely buy another pair. Money well spent!"
129589,1,"I ordered these pumps in black west from Japan cos I've gone to a few web sites of Japanese, but it's sold out everywhere and the price is about 12000-13000 in Japanese currency.This time, I was able to buy this Jessica Simpson's henri pump with 49.99 US dollars+shipping + handling and customs duties, it's about 90Japanese currency all together. Even with the duty, it's still cheaper to buy this pump in the US Amazon than in Japan. I love this Jessica's line. This is the most comfortable, cute and sexy! ^o^"
86181,1,"These shoes, while heavy and not that attractive, have made a difference in my posture and have helped finally get that pesky plantar fasciitis healed. I think it has to do with the weight making the ankle stronger and the stiffness of the shoe not letting my feet pronate. They are great for standing, sitting (like having a footstool on your feet if you're short!) and walking on flat, even surfaces. Not so good for downhill walking. Maybe with practice. I am already looking at the sandals for summer. The best part is when you take them off and put on running shoes, the lack of weight makes walking and running like being on air. Love them."
373710,0,I think this will be a great shoe for people who need to wear orthotics. I ordered the wrong size and decided not to get the correct size.
235852,1,Comfortable shoes and looks good. The color is not one that easily goes with most clothes. Otherwise it would get 5 stars.
132633,1,"If you're new to purchasing dance shoes, make sure you go to the manufacturers website to check their sizing! Buying dance shoes is NOT like buying street shoes.We checked the sizing info, and saw that these dance shoes are comparable to street shoe size, so we opted to getting 1 size up. When the shoes came, my daughter tried them on, and they were just what we were looking for. There was just enough room in the shoe for her to grow into as the dance season progresses. The shoes are very well crafted, as most Capezio brands are, and the fit all around was great."
108607,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
75359,1,I've been looking for that color a long time. I was about to custom make them from sears which they can personalize them on line. Very happy with the sneaker. Still looks good after having them twenty years ago
133476,1,"Skecher's shoes have always provided a good fit for me since I am between a size 11.5 and 12 most shoes don'r really feel good on my feet. THe fit that these shoes provide is perfect for my feet. These shoes are great for work since I tend to walk around a lot during the day at a high school, and they look good."
310196,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
223904,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
173655,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
215435,1,"I purchased this shoes as a gift to my wife. She has a delicated foot, but with this shoes she feels so comfortable. Good choose !!"
50556,1,"Although the heel on these boots look kind of high, they are actually really comfortable and stable to walk in. I have weak ankles, so I was a little worried about it, but they have pretty good support. Make sure that you wear long socks otherwise your skin gets pretty sweaty in the boots. The only complaint that I have was that the tongue seemed to be a little too skinny. The boot fit around my leg and it's not like I have fat legs, but I had to make sure to tie them tight so that the skin didn't show from under the tongue."
365827,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
24342,1,i have been looking for these sandles for a long time i used to have a pair years ago and when i found them i was so happy they fit good and go with everything thanks
167560,1,I bought these based solely on reviews from this site. I was not disappointed at all. I went from winter and boots and high end sneakers because of back problems to a vacation in Hawaii. I lived in these sandals all week and had no issues with comfort or my back. The arch support does work.
134686,1,"Purchased for my wife (she has small feet). She really likes them, says they are comfortable and the price was good."
7762,1,I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner. I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen. I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these! And from this site. Just wish there was free shipping...
71986,2,"This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole."
54788,0,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
73383,1,"Being my first pair of Crocs, I didn't know what to expect. Very pleased with the comfort and fit. I wear them for 2-3 miles at a time and it's like walking on marshmallows.I advise to go large on the size. I wear 10 1/2 to 11 but ordered Mens 12-13 M US and they fit perfect. You DO NOT want these to be a snug fit or you will regret it later. Keep you feet happy."
351639,1,These are so comfy and are really walking shoes. I liked them so much I ordered a second pair. Shoes are difficult for me to buy as my feet are small and narrow but these fit.
351226,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
81459,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
380105,1,I started dance lessons and thought everyday boots would be fine. I was wrong. These Capezio dance shoes made a big difference. Flexibility in movement is great. Heel height perfect. Will come back for tan for the summer.
363526,2,Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it. I do not recommend this seller. Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back.
255912,1,I have bought several pairs of these shoes(other vendors) & love them. I found these on Amazon at a great price. I would wear these all the time if I could.
190381,1,"These shoes were fairly priced, arrived promptly and in good shape. They fit well and are very comfortable, replaced an identical pair that lasted 5 years."
304270,1,"These boots are awesome. They are so comfortable right out of the box and sizing is perfect. I would highly recommend buying these, if your in the market."
264205,1,"These boots are just as advertised, and, in fact, I think they look even nicer in person than in the picture. You do have to order a half size smaller, but they are incredibly comfortable and look AMAZING! They fit my feet perfectly. They were a bit stiff when they first arrived, but after only a few hours wearing them, they feel great and I predict that with a little more wearing in (I've only worn them twice so far), they'll conform to my feet like a glove. These are high quality boots made with high quality materials, and I got them for an incredible price from Amazon. I expect these will last me for years!"
251375,1,"What a pleasure to walk all day in a stylish flat that also offers cushioning and good support and not have to wear clunky running shoes with skirts. I broke several bones in my right foot four years ago and can't wear heels. I also have narrow feet. Well, this is the first shoe I've been able to wear all day and still feel stylish without breaking the bank. I bought them in every color, including metallic silver and gold! A shoe for all seasons:)"
341968,1,"I had been looking for comfy shoes that require no break in time. These took no time at all, they were comfortable from the first time I put them on. They do have a little bit of an ""older"" style to them and are not fashion forward, but with the right combination of clothing and accessories you could pull these off. Definitely worth the purchase."
347203,1,"From the past to the present Converses have always been in style. These classic shoes are all over America today. Why are they so popular? Probably because they've stayed the same over the years. Any type of person can wear these trendy shoes, and a good thing is, they last incredibly long. I recommend these shoes to babies all the way up to adults!"
333823,1,"These sandals are open, airy and very sexy. They are comfortable and show off summer feet to perfection"
112767,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
251711,1,"I LOVE these boots! I don't know much about cowboy boots, but I love these! The colors and the stitching are absolutely beautiful! The stitching on the top of the foot is far enough forward that it shows when I wear jeans. I was a little worried that the black sole would look tacky with brown and pink boots, but it looks fine. I wear a 9.5 and I found these to be true to size. They were a little tight across the top of my foot, but after I wore them for a couple of days, they stretched out and fit perfect. I have low arches and found them to have great arch support. I wore them for 3 days straight right after I got them and didn't have any problems with blisters or rubbing."
201222,1,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
33784,1,"I bought these for my eleven year old. She loves these, so, I don't really know how conforable they are because she really cares more about how they look. The price was the same as other vendors. It was just easy to order on-line."
228606,1,"This is my first pair of Chucks, and I have to say that I am absolutely in love with them. A good looking, comfortable, light shoe that goes with everything - what more could you want?"
9419,1,"this boot is a very good work boot, easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years, amazon had the best price.."
279481,1,My son absolutely loved this shoes. They came in perfect condition. The best part was I did not have to hunt them down locally.
249196,1,"Excellent quality, extremely comfortable slipper. Please purchase atleast one size bigger then your normal size. I wear a size 9, but purchased a size 10. Thank goodness I did because they fit like a glove. Other then that a great slipper."
181502,1,"I bought these shoes about two months ago and wore them just about daily. They are very durable, and show no signs of wear whatsoever- except for the smell. I seem to have allowed mud to get into my shoes (walked a lot on wet grass) and I unknowingly let this stuff cake on the insole. This mud allowed bacteria to grow rapidly and has created the most unholy stink that I have ever known to come of a pair of shoes. I am currently spraying them with some anti-odor foot powder and hoping that the problem will go away. In the meantime, these are unwearable.Buy the shoes- they are made with great quality and look very sharp. In fact, I got compliments about them from almost everyone who saw me wearing them. But you should also take great care in maintaining these shoes- wash them if you ever walk around in wet grass or mud, and spray them daily with anti-odor powder. These will (likely) last for a decade if you treat them the way that they are meant to be treated.By the way, these can be washed. They are made for getting wet (hence the name ""boat shoes""), so there is no issue with running these under a faucet. Just make sure you towel-dry them and let them air-dry before putting them back on. Also, they should be washed after exposure to salt-water- the salt will damage the leather and shorten the life of your shoes.One final note- buy ONLY after you have tried on your particular model in person. I am normally a size 9.5, but had to get size 8.5 Sperry's when I tried these on in a store. They are made in some foreign country that rejects American shoe size standards, so the size listed here on amazon isn't necessarily (or likely to be) true to your idea of what a given shoe size is."
247538,1,I have been looking for red shoes for months and was so happy to find these. They come in narrow and they are low heeled. The first pair I received were too small so order a half size larger than you typically wear.
154802,1,"This being the first time I have ordered these, so far I am pleased. They appear very well made and my child finds them comfortable. Also, size seems to be right on."
134838,2,"Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe). I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size. Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes!"
24287,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
206435,1,"I have used Reebok Classic Nylon Sneakers for years and as long as they still make them, I will be using them."
382683,0,"I ordered one size larger and the length of the flip flops seems to work for me. However the banding is not tight enough for a secure fit. i can't imagine walking around outside to run a few errands. These are comfortable and adequate for around the house flip flopping--they do not serve as my quick, go to slip-ons for the outside."
224093,1,"I bought the shoes for my little sister as a gift. She was delighted. She says the shoes are very confortable and can wear different styles. Nice confection and they were sent ontime. From my side, no complains."
258056,1,"I'm hesitant to buy shoes without trying them on first, but between the price and Nine West quality, I took a chance and won. Nine West runs small; I ordered a half size larger than normal and it fit perfectly. These shoes are amazingly comfortable for something styled like this. Feedback I've gotten from observers is that they are quite attractive and sexy. I wore them to my new governor's Inaugural Ball and my feet didn't start hurting until after 4 hours of standing up/dancing."
102737,0,"UPDATE: I sent the defective shoes back to Capezio and they replaced them, no charge. So, I bumped them up from 1 star to 3 for their excellent customer service. If these shoes do better than the last, I'll give them 5 stars. I do like the Capezio fit better than the Bloch... the Bloch don't seem to stay on my heel as well.I love Zumba and Latin dance. These shoes are great for both; they have just the right amount of slide for turns without hurting your ankles when on linoleum or wood floors. (Some waxes and mat cleaning solutions can make the floors slippery, but as a rule, they are great.) I ALWAYS change shoes when I get in the studio, and have occasionally worn them into clubs, as they are comfortable, black and always in my car. (I'm a student.)Unfortunately, I bought these last Fall and in May they are tearing between the uppers and the molded sole. An inside loop for the shoe lace broke first. I think these failures are premature for a shoe designed for these applications. Due to a sprained foot, I'd only actually used them for 5 months, so because of their short life I demoted them from 5-stars to only 1-star. I can no longer recommend them to anyone.Size-wise, you should probably buy these in a real store where you can try them on. I wear a Men's 9 in my regular shoes. I tried both the ""12 M"" and the ""13 M"" shoes. The 12s seemed tight, so I got the 13s. Once in the studio, I realized that the ""turning ball"" on the sole didn't align with the ball on my foot. So, I exchanged them for the 12.. and they fit like a glove.. like an OJ Simpson glove. Snug, but good."
192409,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
183543,1,"These go on easily. They take a beating and still look good. At 15EEE almost any shoe would be heavy, but these are comfortable walking on city sidewalks. The tongue will curl about the end of the shoes useful life. The heal hold fine for my foot, so they don't slip-off while walking. This is my third pair."
373285,0,"...make sure you have a short car ignition key (if that's what you'll be using it for). My findings after trying one of these on in a local sporting goods store.The problem with all wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist, when you fasten them to your wrist, the wallet contours to your wrist and you don't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3"" car key. The result is not only uncomfortable, unsightly, but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.Now if the wrist wallet is super wide (Amazon doesn't post measurements unfortunately) then you could put your key inside width-wise, following the direction of your forearm instead of length-wise (perpendicular to your forearm).Looks like I'll just have to stick to my less-than-sexy-looking shoe wallet for my runs, sigh..."
343778,1,Bought item for my bro...so all i can say is delivery was on time...Thank You!
152994,1,"The Ugg Australia Women's Classic Tall Boots were justwhat I was shopping for and found them on Amazon $11. lessthan the many places I inquired, plusfree shipping, Thank you Amazon.com"
147901,1,LOVE IT!! Packaging was perfect and product is perfect. Highly recommend product and vendor. Hope you enjoy the product and are successful with the vendor as I have was with this purchase.
388861,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
348991,1,"If I wear jeans, then I'm wearing boots, and these are it. I love these boots. Comfortable from day one, they're long lasting, they look good, what more can you ask for? Highly recommended."
36390,1,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
235743,1,"Nice shoe which gives professional appearance. It makes good for everyday use. However with glued sole, one cannot expect that these shoes would last more than a two years with daily wear. Buyers who consider place of origin in their purchasing should know that the shoes are manufactured in China."
158817,1,I love these shoes. I got them at a great price and they are quite comfortable. My only problem is with the height of them. The heel is extremely high. I'm 5'9 so being in them makes me feel like the jolly green giant. I plan to have them shaved down a little which should help. Overall I love them.
183881,1,"This shoe is very comfortable. First day of wearing them felt a bit differnt but not bad. When I got home that evening and slipped my shoes off, I has no foot pain, they actually felt good. I ordered to my size and thought that maybe I had ordered the wrong size as to the roominess of the shoe, but did some research and found out it was the proper fit. Truly love these shoes and now am looking to by a more stylish pair for everyday wear."
238629,1,"Love this wallet. Durable, functional and handy. Classy enough to be worn with a suite or in jeans. I'm on my 2nd one. The 1st lasted for 2 yrs. Highly recommended!"
113554,1,"You can wear these things with ANY OUTFIT. ANY. They always look classy. Of course, I bought the black ones.They're easy to pull on, even if you're just going outside for a second. They're just so useful I have to sing their praises.I'm a bit bigger than a women's size 7.5, so I ordered for an 8. That means I bought a 6 in men's. For people who are dealing with unisex stuff, you'll come to enjoy the slightly more space the shoe offers. It allows your foot to spread out without rubbing them into sad little foot-nubs.These are awesome if you:-have a thing for pull-on shoes.-enjoy converse shoes-need a good pair of shoes for pretty much every occasion.My one problem is a problem with basically all converse shoes- bad arch support. If this is a problem for you, buying an insertable support is a really good idea and will still make this the most goddamn perfect shoe."
203510,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
385103,1,These shoes are one if the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn!Your feet don't feel tired after wearing and because of all the color choices they are stylish also
290916,0,"OK i have used these for two weeks, quality seems to be great, but nothing stands out...shoes are more shiny than they are in picture....plus they still did not break in and feel very hard on the ankles as you walk....i really want to like those ...i don't hate them but i still do not feel tempted to wear them in the morning."
311078,0,"I tried Softwalk for the first time. Either I should have ordered a half size larger or been more mindful of the toe box. On the first day I wore the shoe to work, I had to change to a more comfortable shoe in order to get through the day. There seemed to be a number of stress points, particularly in the toe. They have felt better with a second wear. The appearance surprised me in that the picture does not note just how much flower image is on the shoe.K.Corn- Arkadelphia, AR"
378778,1,Got these a little big but fit wonderfully even big. Only shoes that I could get to stay on my babes feet. Will buy for future baby shower presents.
376421,1,They were what I was expecting. The shoes works well for my older grandma at 93.
151663,1,"Naot Kayla sandals are my main summer shoes. I got my first pair about 5 years ago when I was looking for a sandal with good arch support after a bout with plantar fasciitis, and the minute I put a pair of Kaylas on I knew I would be wearing them a lot. Since then I've bought 3 or 4 more pairs in various colors. They are especially good for traveling. I've done day after day of walking in them and never got a blister, never had my feet ache at the end of the day. These sandals are fabulous."
339580,1,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
154663,1,My husband gets a new pair of Justin Boots for Christmas every year. These hold up well and the sole is great for working in but the boots are still stylish.
337083,1,"How can you go wrong with a pair of classic black Chuck Taylor's. Just keep in mind that the shoe sizes run BIGGER. I wear and 11 and ordered a pair of 11s. A whole size to big for me. I don't mind returning, but just keep that in mind."
66249,1,I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them. Good support in the arch and heel and no rubbing. The spikes are pretty sharp so they make good trail running shoes. You can take the spikes out with a key (provided) and they make good track shoes.
79199,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
249182,1,"These slippers are comfortable, the non slip souls are great and they are warm on your feet. I like that I can tighten them if needed."
190389,1,I order these shoes at least twice a year as my son's school requires these shoes as part of their dress code. I have never been disappointed!
311457,1,"These are just what I wanted ... stylish, comfortable shoes that I could slip on and off."
342266,1,"I absolutely love this shoe! They are soo comfortable and look great on. I have flat feet so I have a hard time finding running shoes that fit me, infact I havent bought a pair of running shoes in almost 3 years because I havent found any that fit right. I tried this brand on at a department store and loved them, but not the price. So when I found these on amazon I had to have them and am sooo glad that I did!!! Recommend them to anyone and everyone!!!"
296630,1,"I bought this shoe, but ordered the wrong size, i gave it to my friend, he loved it."
146611,1,"This is my 4TH. pair.I had polio and require a lift on the right shoe.They lookgreat.I am still wearing two of the older pairs.They have been a good shoe for me!The others I got at the brace shop, cost way more than the price at Amazon."
205031,2,"In the summer of 2008 I wanted to buy a comfortable, supportive sandal to wear on our trip to Disney World. I read a lot of reviews on Chacos and read about the technology behind the design. I was sure that Chacos would be a perfect choice and bought a pair for myself and my teenage daughter after being fitted by a REI salesperson. We both wore them to Disney and we both had problems right away. Both of us complained of pain in our big toe joints and we had problems with the strap tightening around the toe while we walked. At some point during the trip I had lost all the feeling in one big toe and had a deep indent where the strap was. It felt like when you get a shot of Novocain and your lip feels numb when you touch it. (I had no feeling at the tip of my toe for three months! And then it gradually got better during the fourth month.) My guess is that the strap damaged a nerve. During the summer of 2009 I wore the sandals again for short periods of time with no problem, so I decided to take them again to Disney with the intention of constantly checking the strap and keep it very loose around my toe. I was successful, but at the end of the first day my toe started to feel prickly. That's when I retired my Chacos and bought a pair of FitFlops which were extremely comfortable and gave me no problems for the rest of the week. My daughter ended up giving up her Chacos also. She felt they were very uncomfortable and ended up buying another sandal at Disney that worked well. We really wanted to like our Chacos and gave them a good chance. Unfortunately they didn't work for us."
165756,1,"I use these shoes for my running and they're the absolute best. Every time I slip them on after wearing anything else (thin Converse or older sneakers), they're like Heaven. They mold around your foot so nicely! I've been running in them for over a year and they're still perfect. I'll always use ASICS for my workout shoes."
52773,0,"Looks great, however not comfortable to walk in all day long. The strap across the top rubs in a painful manner across the top of my foot. I am hoping that this will go away after breaking in period."
233667,1,To say my daughter was excited to get these at Christmas is an understatement! These were shipped to us quickly and were in perfect condition!
204047,1,"I ordered these boots for my boyfriend for Christmas in the wheat/cream color. He previously owned the same exact boots, and from personally seeing them before, they are awesome! I definitely recommend buying. However, the pair I ordered was damaged during shipping and it was the last pair of the specific size. The company was fast and helpful in giving me a refund though! Wasn't necessarily their fault, other than maybe bad packaging?"
182823,1,I am on my feet all day as a nurse and these are the perfect shoes for those long hours.
34462,1,I was pleased with the entire transaction from the ordering to delivery. Product was just exactly what I wanted and ordered. Thank you!
272837,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
16707,1,"let me preface by saying that my previous shoes were $350 (I pre-ordered and received them the day they came out) bright orange, F50 prime, that weighed 5 oz each. COOL! is what everybody thought about those rocket boots. I still love them even though they are all stretched and worn out after about a year of daily use. I also have my older F50 adizero chameleons (now cleaned up and for display) and those were more than double the price of the copa as well. Now, I still prefer the orange primes over my new copas when it is wet and muddy, because they are plastic they can be hosed off easily and forgotten about until needed again. I knew I needed to move away from F50s when they came out with the micoach computerized model. because I dislike micoach and it's generally very-buggy software. (a former micoach pacer addict, here).NOT HOT...You need to take care of them. I tried the shower trick when they were new and treat them often about once a week at least with leatherfood from eurosport. Traction is slightly less. They do not run as fast. (if you haven't worn out several pairs of top line F50s then you will probably just say ""lame excuse, you just can't run as fast as you want to""... my 100m PR is 11s even and I can do a 5k in 16:50) They just don't feel as fast as the TOTL synthetics; in football speed isn't everything.So the copa traction is not as good, the speed is not as good. They are more than double the weight. So... what makes these shoes worthy of a 5 star review???SMOKING HOT...here the magic of the copa comes in. Whatever hesitation I would have, that extra touch I always felt I needed before letting off a shot or pass, it's gone. I am finally at the point where I can start learning juggling tricks. I've been playing since I was 4 and up through HS of course, but about a year ago I really stepped up my game. I worked hard to get where I am, and I'm not letting shoes take the credit for that. but I do think they help.Some day, adidas (and nike and friends) will figure out how to make a plastic shoe with better touch than K-leather. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to have your boot custom made exactly to your foot as precision-measured by a robot. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to print your own designs on your boots in any colour of the rainbow. but that day has not yet come. Everybody in the world will be able to afford a pair, and they will last forever. unless you want a new pair, and then the old boots will instantly turn into delicious cookies and beer. but that day has not yet come. Until that day comes I don't see anything better than copas, for me.If you look in the dictionary under football cleat you will see a picture of adidas copa. I'm no superstar; I pay to play, I don't get paid to play. I'm like everybody who just wants to have fun on the field and if you are the same, you should at least consider your next shoes a pair of copas too.That being said, if you've been wearing copas for the last four hundred years, and would never, ever, consider anything else, go out and try on the latest obscenely-expensive, all-synthetic, high-fashion boot. You may just be pleasantly surprised. At least enjoy modern technology once in a while. I will be buying another pair of F50s before long. I am simply addicted to the speed and the colours.P.S. Messi wears F50s, sure. but he wears very special leather F50s, not plastic ones. If I want to be like messi I will wear his shirt of which I have several. Not his latest adidas boot..."
24204,1,"These boots fit very well. The sizes are true. Plus, they are very well made. I am definitely pleased with this purchase."
294438,1,"Fantastic fit and feel.. negative heal-cup = comfort.found the best deal on the net, shoesontheweb.comOverstock said they price match.. but that turned out to be bunk.I've had a pair of everything Birks, keen, .. My favorite pair was from Bass (suv series). But they were discontinued. I couldn't be happier with these. It's been a few months too and they are wearing well. I use them like slippers--mostly indoors."
233873,1,I have always been. Big Vans fan. I never owned the classics but after buying them I love them. Really comfortable and are made much better than other company's shoes that are made to look like vans.
230361,1,"I love these boots. They're nice and high, and they hug my foot nicely. I have a very high instep, and there's no pinching, so it's a good happy medium. Only thing is, I find the heel a bit narrow, and it required a bit of practice to walk on. Other than that, five full stars. Also, here in downtown Toronto, I've gotten more than a few compliments on the way they look. All in all, the best rubber boots I've ever owned."
125702,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
131834,1,The length of these shoes is perfect but I have wide feet and they are a bit narrow.
121012,1,"THIS IS THE MOST WANTED SHOE FOR MY FATHER EVERY TIME I GO TO NEW YORK WE SEARCH BUD NOTHING LIKE THIS COLOR AN WEIGHT THIS IS PERFECT THANKS TO AMAZON I CAN FIND EVERYTHING, I LOVE THIS PAGE."
279119,0,"I normally wear a size 8 in shoes, especially heels. So I got these in a size 8. Well they fit like they are a size 7. My feet aren't exactly narrow, but I rarely, rarely ever wear a size 9. But I now have to return these shoes so I can get a 9. I really hope the 9's fit because I absolutely love this shoe! They are gorgeous! The quality seems good (even though I haven't worn them yet), but when I got them they looked like they had been wet before or when they dyed them it dyed unevenly or something (I got the red ones), but you can tell they haven't been worn, so I'm not sure what that's about, but I'm sure it has something to do with the seller and not the actual shoe itself. So hopefully the size 9 will fit me so I can review on the actual comfort of the shoe!"
320859,0,"I added a photo to this product, and if you take a look - the photos in the ad are misleading as to color and texture. Other than that, it was very difficult to first get the boot on. I have a high in-step, so I'm used to this. It took about three minutes of tugging to get the right boot on, but the left one went on pretty easily. I don't know, but someone else may have tried that boot on that made it easier for me to get on. Once you get the boot on, it's pretty comfortable. I've worn about a half a day and while not used to boots, I'm not experiencing any pain. I expect them to get even more comfortable with wear, and I'm hoping the color takes on a more worn look instead of having a glossy finish as it does now with time and wear."
258723,1,"Oh man I'd forgotten how easy these are to wear! Make sure and get 1 size smaller, they do run big no matter what they say at the shoe store. A classic that never goes out of style. I hadn't had a pair in years and these are rapidly becoming my ""go to"" pair of shoes.PLUS THEY'RE JUST PLAIN COOL!!"
128993,0,"The first day I brought my bag into work, I got compliments from everyone I work with (including the straight men) and I work at a pretty stylish place in LA.It's a great bag for me to take to work and then fold over as a clutchto go out at night with. My one complaint is that the strap is a little awkward.Yes, the bag isn't real leather and yes, it isn't huge but what did you expect for $79? In the garment district, you can get a fake Chloe Paddington for $80 (made out of fake leather that isn't much bigger) - at least you're not paying for a knock off."
304172,1,"This is a great all-round running shoe. Great support, cushioning, stability. And really well made - also- made in the USA."
80994,1,"I absolutely adore the ""Seaside Sandals"" by Reef! I've been wearing this style since I bought a pair 4 years ago at a beach surf shop. Now, I just order them so I can get a good price and get a color I like in this style. The footbed supports my foot and the sole is firm, and yet flexible.I have a lot of trouble with shoes in general since my foot is short but wide, but these shoes are always comfortable from the 1st day I wear them to the last. My ideal shoe is usually a 6 1/2 wide. These come in whole sizes and are medium width, so I go up to the 7M, which seems to work perfectly.I have never gotten a blister from wearing these, which is very rare for me! ;-) I have been able to wear these for some moderate walking with no problem, although as with most sandals or flipflops, these aren't intended to be *walking shoes*, so I'd try to temper that.I purchased these this time in Taupe/Blue floral and they are adorable! the strap is brown on top, with the blue/aqua underneath and on the detailing. The sole is taupe, with a swirly design in the matching brown and blue on the footbed. It disappoints me that over time that design wears away. Otherwise, these sandals really hold up well. I find that they don't ""wear out"" so much as get too grungy. ;-) I have washed my previous pairs safely and successfully in the washer! I spray them w/ a stain spray like Oxy(especially under the strap) and dump a little detergent in, then just toss them in on a short cycle. They come out looking noticeably better, and the colors stand out more. I usually let mine air dry, although I have thrown them in the dryer, too. However, there always comes a point when they just look too grungy even after washing to be salvaged. Bear in mind, a pair of these usually lasts me 2 or 3 full summers, and I always have a couple of pairs lying around!So, yes.. I really love these sandals and would highly recommend them to anyone. :-) I wear them w/ shorts, and I also wear them w/ summer dresses."
282201,1,Great shoe to wear. Only comes in medium width so I had to bring to a shoemaker to expand the width. Had a pair 20 years ago. The old ones were made in England. The new ones are made in Vietam.
7302,1,"I have never ordered shoes before, and I was a little nervous that they might now work. They arrived right on time, are a perfect fit and very comfortable.I appreciate Amazon.Thank you"
252900,1,"after reading countless reviews that stated that these boots ran large by 1/2 to 1 size , I ordered a half size smaller. They were too small! I take a size 9 in everything and a size 9 is what fit in these boots. NOT a 8.5 like was recommended. I think people are confusing the loose ankle fit to being a size too large. This is the style of the boot. They are minimal in design, no interior padding. Sloppy on the ankle, secure in the middle, true to length. Expect this before buying. Comfort is 3 stars, style is 5. Not recommended for anyone who will stand all day."
35086,1,"Would recommend this to nurses like me who work long hours and who have a pet peeve for tie-ing shoelaces. For me, the Nike AirMax 360 was the best I ever had for work, but this slip on is a good alternative. It looks sturdy- my coworker has been using the same pair for 3 years! and it still looks good. I would definitely get another pair in black for my dark scrubs."
147297,1,Love them but definitely order smaller. I wear 8 1/2 so I ordered an 9. Way too big. I sent them back and bought size 8 - they are perfect. Amazon was helpful with the returning/exchanging process.
39140,1,"I have been a huge fan of Danner boots since I was issued my first pair of Matterhorns in 1997 in the Army. I have always referred to Danner as the Cadillac of boots.A couple of years ago, I bought a pair of Danner Light II's and a pair of Danner Patrol boots. I wear these boots to work daily.I cannot recommend these boots enough. The Danner boot has a wide platform, stiff sole, and terribly comfortable upper. After a couple of months, these boots will feel like they were custom made for your feet.These boots are not cheap, but with footwear, you get what you pay for."
24695,0,"I was disappointed with this purse. The leather is very soft and the detailing is nice, but the design is not very practical. It is quite roomy and has two compartments as well as credit card slots, but there is no zip containing these two compartments. There is a zipped pocket inside the purse, but the rest is only contained by the buckled strap. It seems silly to boast of an extra large wrist strap to carry the purse when you can only keep the contents inside the purse by carrying it upright as a clutch. Also, the platinum version is not bright and metallic as shown in the picture; it's more of stone color."
225541,1,Having a wide foot they fit a little on the narrow side - I kept them knowing that canvas will probably stretch without to much problem. Also my shoes make a slight hollow sound from one of the baby toe tips; I'm assuming with time that too will abate.
124569,1,"This item was ordered as a gift for a relative, my nephew in Kansas. He received the item promptly and is very happy with it. Yes, we would order this item again."
253069,1,"Saw these at the Clark's store where they are $120, but got a much better deal on Amazon for around $85. These boots are not only stylish but ridiculously comfortable. This Oakwood color is pretty light (but not too light) so they are good for a casual jeans and a tee shirt outfit. I also got 2 darker pairs for going out. I think it's worth for every guy to have at least one of these in their closet. Sizes run large!! I recommend trying them on at the store. I usually wear 10.5, and I got 9.5 in these and they're perfect."
174456,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
131385,1,This is the only sandal my daughter will wear. These are great. Fast shipping too. Will be back again when its time to buy again. Thanks!..
187182,1,"I broke an outer bone in my foot 4 years ago. Never had therapy. Bought these shoes and discovered that since the break, I had changed my gait to put pressure on the inner foot in order to take pressure off the healing outer bones. In doing so, I'd changed the line-up of my whole leg. The pain in my hip made me think my running and walking days were over. The Kayanos keep my foot in it's natural position and since that first day wearing them I've never had hip pain. The shoes feel like clouds on my feet. I cried. Freedom to run and walk never felt better!"
122520,0,I purchased these in a 7.5 wide but when I got them they didn't feel like a wide shoe even though that is what it said on the box. Better to buy shoes in person I guess.
256088,1,Needed another pair. Had in the past and couldn't find again until now. Very comfortable and easy to slip into. Fit true to size.
44977,0,"fast shipping, but I had to exchange the first purchase because the shoes were too small , I think those shoes have a problem with the shape , but anyway I have exchanged and I am satisfied with my new shoes , if you are thinking about get one of them just take a bigger size. they are really beautiful."
1003,1,"Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
108021,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
284798,1,"I'm on my third pair of these and still couldn't be happier with them. They're incredibly lightweight and comfortable. There's a reason why they're so popular with people who are on their feet a lot. Like other purchasers have noted, they can be more than a little squeaky. But for a quick fix, all you have to do is remove the insert of the shoe and dust it with baby powder on the bottom before replacing it in the shoe. This will greatly reduc,e if not eliminate any friction which is the cause of the squeaking sound."
231794,1,"I bought my first pair of ""mushies"" over six years ago, and I wore them everywhere! I even wore them te entire time I was pregnant (and I gained far more that the recommended 25 lbs). That first pair FINALLY gave up the ghost, so I sadly ordered a new pair. I love them just the same as the old ones. These are great flip flops!!!"
53397,1,The Keds are fine. I have had them for a few days now and they are great. No complaints at all.
217915,1,"I dont think I would recommend these for sports but they are great for just walking. I work in the city and have to dress up but weather permitting, I always walk from my car or train to the office in these, and then change to my formal shoes. Going home, I do the reverse. I find them very comfortable and they hold up well. I highly recommend them for these types of activities but they dont have enough tread for sports."
85379,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
154840,1,"Got a picky little critter who thinks she's dancing for the Moscow Ballet...She loves these. Comfortable, good quality and look good."
166643,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
288638,1,"I purchased these shoes from Amazon to replace a pair of Timberlands that I had been wearing for nearly three years. They were similar to the old ones, except that the insoles weren't attached to the bottom of the shoe, and they appeared to be a little less well-constructed. Have had them about a month now, and no problems yet, but it's hard to replace a pair of well worn in shoes with new ones."
102388,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
126275,1,NB is the only sneaker I will buy. Love the look of this one and it is very confortable. Great colors too.
183526,0,I bought these for my dad. He's a big fan of propet shoes since they come in a extra wide. This style was narrower than others from this same brand so we returned them
262865,1,"On a recent visit, my daughter had lamented about the trouble that she was having finding Chuck Taylor Converse shoes in royal blue. She claimed that she and my father in law had been trying unsuccessfully for sometime to find the shoes. With my recent successes purchasing things on Amazon, I went in, found the shoes, ordered them, and before we were done with the conversation had them on their way.They arrived within the week, and she is happy, which makes me happy."
286671,1,"This is a great product. The boots fit great straight out of the box. The distressed leather gives them a vintage appearance and the leather is soft and comfortable. There are ""flaws"" where the leather sole meets the rubber - you can see the tool marks from where the leather has been trimmed down. These marks are barely noticable and give the boots a great hand crafted look. A very good buy - the best boots i have ever purchased."
226861,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
198010,1,"There are certain brands that I, and most people I know, can always depend on to deliver a good product ... Levis, Lee's, Fossil, Red Wing, Nike, etc. ... Converse is definitely in that group of brands ... AND, that's just one thing that's great about Converse... Another is thing that I love about Converse is hoe much I love... Yes love... their initiative to take their shoes and make a big STEP further with the wonderful fun and creative styles and designs they now do with them! It's great that one can even go on their site and do their own custom artwork to bring out one's own style personality! Now that's innovative and being in touch with customers!I remember back in the 70s when I was a tween that they were about mainly basketball before they took off as everyday comfortable footwear... As it moved more to that I saw a lot of designs and artwork starting to appear on the canvas shoes... Ya' know 70's stuff like peace signs, and flowers, and rainbows in psychedelic neon colors... Ha!I'm sure some saw it as graffiti or, like when the style trend was to get jeans to have that really worn look... To the extent that some took scissors to their brand new jeans and cut holes in the knees... Funny really.. But it was fun and that's why fashion and trends are fun because individual style and personality can be expressed to the world without saying a word! It wouldnt surprise me at all to find out that now they are employed by Converse to develop and design the more whimsical shoes that make for ""Happy Feet"" indeed!Anyway,Kudos to Converse for really getting that and making a good shoe that also has pazzazzzz! Also, as far as the transaction of my purchase at Amazon.com for these ... It was the same as the many many other purchases I've had before... On Amazon I know I'll find what I'm shopping for... At a better price than out and about the malls and shops ... And, if I pay attention and use all of the benefits and promotions they provide to help with cost... I truly end up on the bargain end of my consumerism... So, let's see ... I've gone way past 20 words now... Let's just say I thought it said 200 not 20! Ha!!"
35609,1,"Got sand, water, rock? Then these might be one of the best sandal's ever.I have such a hard time finding shoes that are comfortable for my narrow-ish feet. These are SO perfect. I wear a 8.5 and decided to go down a half size instead of up, due to my narrow foot, it's perfect! I will buy another pair. They were comfortable from the get go."
352777,1,"The only thing I would recommend is if you want to wear socks with them order a 1/2 size or whole size up. I like to wear thick socks in the winter, I ordered my regular size and I can barely wear a thin sock. But all and all they are good quality."
59228,1,"I hike fairly frequently in the Sierra mountains, often in rocky, steep or muddy terrains. So I spent a good amount of time researching for the best pair of boots that will provide and comfort and durability for an all-day hike. I finally decided on these Altitude IV boots.I was very pleased with my decision, as they were very comfy, no blisters, and durable, not to mention better looking than other hiking boots. Good grip over rocks, mud and dirt trails. I will buy another pair of Altitude IV after these wear out."
118088,1,"Outstanding quality, but runs small. I ordered my child a size 9, her regular shoe size. They fit, but BARELY. When I hold them up to her regular size 9 shoes, they're about an inch shorter. Should've ordered up half a size. I love these slippers, but my child rarely wears them because they're so tight."
156584,1,"I really like these booties, I wish they were a little higher. I didn't send them back because they are so cute and comfortable. Fits true to size. I wear an 8 1/2 and I have a medium width foot."
161720,1,This money clip was a perfect replacement for a worn-out one. I was glad to find it.
222860,1,My Uncle was very happy with his slippers. He told me they wer very comfortablewhen he wore them around the house.
368237,1,I wear a 9 1/2 so I ordered a size 10 instead of the 9 based on other reviews that said these sandals run small and you need to order larger. WRONG. I am swimming in the 10s and will have to return/exchange them for a size 9. They do feel like they would be comfortable if only they weren't so big.
272278,1,"I have often kept myself from spending top dollar on a shoe. I never felt it would be worth the extra money when an $80 shoe could or should perform as these do. I know now you get what you pay for. The testarossa is in a field of its own. There isn't much to compare it to. Although these are a technical shoe they will astound on any wall, big or small, including bouldering. Just amazing!"
61807,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
81204,1,"I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens, but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price. They are lightweight and comfortable, and look very nice in solid black. The best thing about them is their durability. I am tough as hell on shoes in general, but these are very scuff resistant. I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair, but we'll see."
306095,0,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
69198,1,Purchased these shoes for my son who just 'had to have them' They are worn every other day(we switch them out with the cookie monster ones) and so far they still look great and are keeping their shape. They provide great support and of course they match with quite a few outfits!!
147460,1,"This is my third pair of these shoes purchased over the past 4 years. I now have azure, natural, and black and wear them all summer long. It's very hard to find summer casual shoes that come in narrow widths, and these are very comfortable as well as versatile. You can wear them with shorts or casual skirts. When I can find them, I wear a 9.5AAAA in dress shoes. A 9AA in the Trinidads fits great."
283593,1,"This are super confortable shoes if you do not mind the 'men' look. Great with pants. Wear for 8h or longer with no pain, padding is extraordinary. The brown is beautiful."
246096,0,....but my wife reports that it does not fil her foot very well. It is the smallest 5.5 shoe she has ever had....
355520,1,"I have some of thease and they, i think, are the best and almost all of the guys on the teem have thease, they also work for girls! I'd Know!"
156396,1,"This is a very light weight work shoe. I only wished it was a little wider. I love the heel height butthe back could have been made a little higher. It sits very low on the ankle. The company logo""Eastland"" (green tag) should not be glued on to the shoe. The Eastland logo is inside the shoe and that should suffice. I tried removing the tags but its either sewn onto and also glued. We have strict dress coderegarding shoes being black without any logo's showing. I didn't want to risk damaging the shoes by removingthe green tags so I had to color it all black with a permanent marking pen. But I do love the look of the shoes. The heel gives me a bit of height"
163409,0,"These tear really easily. I feel like I shouldn't complain because they ARE really affordable, but.... They probably work well for indoor use. I just wanted something to keep the mud and animal droppings out of the treads of my shoes, and they do that ok. But they do tear and leak, so don't count on them for protection from wet."
241070,1,"I like the retro style of these shoes, very well made and a decent price. I wish the tongue of the show was wider and did not slide around as much."
200439,0,"This is my first Sperry product. I wear boat shoes all the time, and have had problems with them smelling bad after several weeks of use without wearing socks. A friend suggested Sperry for their strange ability to not start stinking. Sure enough, he was right. These shoes do not develop stinky foot odors. I would rate them much lower if not for that fact.The reason for the negativity is the soles suck. They are slippery when wet. For example, I slip and slide over wet metal plates that they put on streets and sidewalks that are under construction. No other shoes do that. For a shoe called a boat shoe, they aren't good in wet conditions. Other Sperrys have different soles. These are pretty smooth on the bottom, so watch out for smooth bottom Sperrys. Another bad thing about the soles is they are too thin. You feel the road, so to speak.I might try another Sperry because of their mysterious non-stinky ability, but I'll make sure there's some texture to the bottom of the sole, and that its thicker than the one on these."
111411,1,"It took a long time for my goth phase to pass (23, after a promotion requiring a wardrobe overhaul). Trust that I have worn almost every alternative style boot out there, as well as boots in some form since I was 10. As the title suggests, these are the best of the best. Demonia always runs about a half size too large, but it works out fine because I use the tri-orthodic insoles they sell at the grocery store for extra comfort. PLATOON is well padded but wearing an additional insole gives you some arch support and preserves the sole longer. I wore these nearly every day for 4 years. Towards the end of the 2nd, the inside back of the heel started to wear, but it never went through. Nor did the actual heel ever separate from the boot itself, like some of Demonia's knee high platforms do. The toe is really exaggerated but not absurdly so. The traction is excellent.I recommend this over the RANGER which is too wide and poorly constructed."
105270,1,"These shoes are adorable. I have only had a chance to wear them once, but when I did I recieved plenty of compliments and no blisters. For the price they are amazing!!!"
316335,1,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them. We got them a half size smaller because we heard they stretch over time. The color is slightly darker than pictured.
158660,1,"These shoes were instantly comfortable. They required no breaking in process. What a great deal. I wore Mizunos before, but love these now."
148615,2,"I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past; however, the description on Amazon is incorrect. This is NOT a 3 pair pack, it is only one pair of socks for $13.99 plus shipping. What a rip-off. I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack"
194369,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
165584,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever made and they look very conservative. I have them in several colors because they look good with slacks or skirts. They hold up well with everyday use and are lightweight so they pack well. If you try one pair, you keep coming back to them for your basic wardrobe."
82868,1,I love love this sandal. So very comfortable for your feet. It's so pretty and also inexpensive. The size fits well.
212150,1,"the sandals are very comforatble and you cant beat that price, i would defintely invest in these sandals."
336591,1,"My favorites! So comfortable, I've worn out my first pair :( Now I wish I'd bought 3-4 pair :( Will keep watching for another pair to order!"
141539,2,"The price was remarkably low. Now my husband knows why: the sole is not rubber, therefore these boots are slippery. Yes, they are warm and have leather uppers. And they slip on (no pun intended) with ease--good for running outside to fill the bird feeders, turn on the car and scrape the windows, or take out the garbage. But currently, they're unusable because we're having a particularly icy winter. He'll still use them--when it thaws, but still cold--just not as much as he hoped. If the nature of the soles would have been disclosed by the seller, he probably would have sprung for one of the more costly like-pairs that came up on his search"
51260,1,i just received these boots but they look great ! be sure to buy a size smaller then what you were in tennis shoes. very light weight.
314979,1,"My husband wears these as his work boots in the kitchen, we had to add some insoles for more comfort but they are holding up well and he really likes them"
170837,0,"I loved my croc flip flops. I bought them in later spring and until yesterday, I pretty much wore them everyday. They were so light weight and I have a foot injury, so they didn't hurt my foot like my other sandles. I had to attend a funeral yesterday afternoon, so I threw my tennis shoes and crocs in my gym bag for after the funeral. When I got done working out, I went to slide my crocs on and couldn't fit my foot into them. THey are warped and at least two sizes smaller. I will probably buy another pair, but think they should have at least warned me."
291749,1,Purchased these boots for cowboy costume for Halloween--however they will be worn alot more! Good quality product and fit.
275330,0,"I have only had these shoes for a short time and maybem they need to br broke in a little, but the arch area is a little uncomfortable."
58706,1,The quality doesn't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached. I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price. On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet. I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good.
84340,1,"In typical fashion, Crocs' always delivers with true to size and color. Got these for my mother who has been having a problem with swelling feet and now she owns 4 or 5 different colors so they will go with anything. Very comfortable with no slipping or sliding."
234574,1,these shoes are great i thought they were going to be plastic and fall apart on me but when i got them they were beautiful.my next question was how long will they last and believe it or not for what i payed for these i wish i had gotten 2 pairs because these are quality shoes worth in the range of $80
182594,1,This shoe has been a real asset in the snow and ice. The recommendation to buy 1/2 size larger was right on. Fit great with no break-in time.
155544,1,"Initially the item was not delivered to the requested address; since the seller is using the USPS, which is not as efficient as UPS or DHL; however the seller made all efforts to track the item and finally was located in some post office and I have to go my self and collect it.For deliveries, I would suggest to the seller, to use UPS or DHL even if you charge the client the additional cost."
4342,1,"I have been a Merrell boot fan for 20 years, but my feet seem to want wider boots now and my preferred Merrell (Perimeter) does not come wide enough. As another recent reviewer notes Merrells are wide to start, but not wide enough in this case. I wasn't pleased that I had to switch because I loved all my Merrells, but I have been extremely pleased with my Altitudes. The wide size does work for me. These are comfortable for hiking, working in the woods, or just general wear. These have been my almost-every-day boots for over 18 months and they are holding up extremely well- the side seam is starting to go but they will still last a couple more months and there is still a little tread left. My next pair of boots (within 2 months) will definitely be another pair of wide Altitudes."
146288,0,"Being a female college student, I felt a necessity to own a pair or two of Uggs. Everybody wears them, but after my first winter in Michigan, I don't really understand why. Although they are super warm, they aren't waterproof (sucks for slushy days and wet snow), they don't have good traction (difficult to walk on snow and ice), and being made of sheepshin, they're difficult to clean. The salt put on the roads here damages them. I own the Ugg cleaning/care kit, and even that isn't enough to keep my Uggs looking good.I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who lives in a snowy place. Invest in some real snowboots."
338334,1,Great product. Great price. Have recommended the boots to friends. My child loves them. The parents of his friends have been asking where I got them.
68466,1,"I decided to try the Green Silence because I wanted to see what impact, if any, a lightweight shoe would have on my times. I picked the Green Silence for the ""eco friendly"" concept, and because of the crazy color scheme. Not really an informed purchase.I'm a 6'- 3"", 190 lb. guy, so I'm not small. I've been running on Nike Zoom Vomeros for the past two years and didn't think that I'd find a shoe that would offer me as much comfort as the cushioning found in the Vomeros. I was very happy to find that despite their light weight and minimalist design, that the Green Silence offered the necessary amount of cushioning. I was also pleased with the large toe box. I've used them for 3 runs so far. My thoughts:Run #1, speed work, 6 x 400's:My feet felt more... nimble? Without the weight of my typical shoe weighing me down, I felt like the speed work was much easier. This was my first effort with these shoes. I ordered size 13 (I usually wear size 12 in Nike), and it was perfect. NO blisters after my first run. Total of 5 miles, including the 6 x 400.Run #2, tempo run, 5 miles:This is where I expected to start to complain about the more minimalistic design. Nope. My feet felt great, still no blisters. I also noticed that I'm not landing on my heel the way I was before.Run #3, long slow run, 10 miles:I still can't believe that these are a lightweight shoe. The cushioning provided a great ride for the entire run. At the end of 10 miles I felt like I could have kept going for another 10. Finally, a blister on the front of my big toe, never had that one before... I still think ordering the size bigger was the right decision though.I would definitely recommend these shoes."
267624,1,"This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend"
386485,1,"I like the design, but the bottom was kind of weird. They feel kind of strange walking around in them, but I'm not sure if that's just because I have yet to break them in, or because the design inherent in the shoe is messed up. You have to do up the laces all the way up the shoe's tongue yourself."
78439,1,I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them. They were a very good price and I will probably buy more.
152031,0,"I have hand/foot syndrome from chemo, which means that my feet get very sensitive, hot and irritated. I need very comfortable shoes. These are average. To me, they are not as comfortable as everyone claims, but it could just be because I don't have average feet. I normally wear a 9.5M. I bought a 10M and they just fit and are quite snug. If I were wearing thick socks, they would be uncomfortable. They do look nice and I have gotten compliments on them. I will keep them for Summer wear when I'm wearing thinner socks than normal. I guess if you're looking for super comfort, you are going to have to cough up the big bucks for the pricier shoes."
106275,1,"I was really impressed with the sizing. My son is very happy, these were just what he wanted."
36090,1,"A while back I was preparing for an extended trip to Alaska and my trusty old USMC Belleville's were, frankly, a bit long in the tooth and not exactly what I wanted to bring along. With a wide foot, I searched high and low, in more places than I can even recollect, before I happened to come across these boots. I ordered a pair and, when they arrived, they fit like a glove. I wore them around locally before carrying them to Alaska because the last thing you want to experience in remote parts of Alaska is a failure in any manner of equipment, let alone among the most important pieces of equipment like solid footwear.To boil it down - these are amazing. I could not wait to take them to Alaska and, once there, I wore them every single day, through 20+ hours of daylight, in every condition imaginable. I was absolutely brutal on these boots, putting them through every thing you can think of. They were soaked, but, thanks to being waterproof, my feet were dry and warm. They were submerged in mud, dirt, hiked over rocks, through forest, through riverbeds, glaciers, dirt trails, gravel, etc., etc., etc. I can't tell you how much I put these through but, through everything, the only damage they managed to sustain was a small nick on the toe of the left boot. Since then, I've also worn them in the Smokies, the snow, the ice and swampy marshes. They never fail to deliver the absolute best protection, traction and comfort.More importantly, they were, and remain, the most comfortable pair of footwear I have ever owned in my life. I absolutely love these boots and, if my wife wouldn't hit me over the head with a cast-iron skillet, I'd wear them to bed. Kidding aside, they are incredible and, although they cost more than any pair of shoes/boots I've ever had, they are worth every penny.For upkeep, definitely get someHUBERD SHOE GREASE 7.5 Oz Shoe Grease. It is by far one of the superior products I've ever used on my boots and, after coming back from Alaska, I worked a fresh coat of Huberd's into these boots and they looked absolutely brand new. My wife was amazed at how they appeared, especially her knowing first hand what I put them through. Outside of that little nick I mentioned on the left boot, you would have thought they had just come out of the box.I can't recommend these boots highly enough. Worth every bit of acclaim and every penny they cost. They will last you many, many years.Highly recommended."
309732,1,"When will there be more colours and sizes in 9M available???? This is a very comfortable shoe and good wearing. Will more be offered and if so,when? When one finds a good shoe and style it is disheartening that more are not on offer. Why change a good,sure thing????"
51485,0,The style and fit are fantastic but........ my pair has an odor from day 1 that I just can't get rid of. I even get busted by my team members. I really do like these shoes though and would hope they all don't have the problem I am still experiencing. PS I'm sure I could have sent them back for a different pair.
248275,1,"I received these boots yesterday at noon. Being excited about them I laced them up and put them on. Wore them the rest of the day. Took them of after 9 hours and felt like I was wearing a pair of boot that has been broke in for two years. I work in a machine shop and am on my feet all day. As well as volunteer as a Fireperson for KVFD in Kimball, Nebraska. On any day of the year we may have a grass fire I don't think my feet will hurt after the next few we have."
194627,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
33065,1,THESE BOOTS ARE SO CUTE. THEY FIT WELL SEEM TO BE WARM. MOST OF ALL MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER KC LIKES THEM.
299141,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
304686,1,"This is the third pair I have purchased. Normally I purchase them in a store, but this time I decided to try this Amazon partner. I purchased these for my brother and he loves them. They were shipped quickly to him and came in perfect condition. I will purchase from this vendor again."
366681,0,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
164952,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
266696,1,"I have a bad foot, past neuroma surgery. These boots are the most supportive, stable, comfortable things I have put on my feet in years. VERY reasonably priced, considering the comfort and quality. I just ordered the low-shoe version of these too. That is how much I like them."
337053,1,Good. Cheap. Classical Chuck Taylor allready. Buy them.Enought comment. Remember to pray for the Converse. Kiss you dude.Bye. k?
267043,1,"I just received my boots today, about 4 days after ordering. Shipping was very fast considering it was free. I'll be honest, when I first put these boots on, I literally thought ""What the hell did I just buy?"" I decided to walk around in them in a bit, because I read that they require some break-in. Well, after wearing them around the house for only a couple hours, they already are starting to feel extremely comfortable. I will test these boots out in the field as soon as possible and report back. My initial impressions are that these boots are an extreme value at only $[...]."
72991,1,I wear size 15 shoes and have had trouble finding crocs in my size. These fit the bill (or the foot)!
180677,1,I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted. They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
338408,0,I got the boots for my grandson. They look and they are just what I was expecting. The only problem is I think the material is to hard. My grandson always complain that they hurt. We now is the right size and with and we are using the right socks to go with that kind of boots. For little sensitive feet they should be more flexible. Other than that I will say that I own a pair of timberland boot and I been very satisfy with them but for the little ones they are having a little hard time. Oh going further need to mention that the price was right!!
77281,0,"I *love* the squishy-soft footbed for work on concrete and tile floors. But the Beach Clog allows my orthotics to roll over (outside of ankles roll under), creating ankle pain. I have fixed the problem somewhat by adding thick self-stick window insulation foam on the outside edges of the inside of the Crocs footbeds. So long as the insulation doesn't migrate, it works, sort of acceptably.I cannot wear my Crocs without orthotics because their arch support is simply not high enough. I haven't tried Crocs Relief clogs, but for we supinators with orthotics, Beach Clogs aren't what they could be.Update as of May, 2009: I CAN wear Crocs without orthotics! Necessary because window tapes kept shifting out of place. I had to try it for a couple of days to get the feel and to keep my left ankle, the roll-under one, upright (I tripped a lot while concentrating on feets and not walkways). But I can wear them sans arch supports, even out on walks for a hour or more. The only catch has been when my two labs pulled hard, and I had to shuffle loose Crocs (backstrap up -- oops!) to keep up. Lab training is not the responsibility of the Crocs people!"
106117,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
162177,1,"Lamentablemente, A&uacute;n no he recibido el producto que compr&eacute;. Todav&iacute;a estoy esperando respuesta del vendedor. Agradezco hacer lo APROPIADO a fin de saber &iquest;Qu&eacute; pas&oacute;?. Muchas gracias."
274592,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
88534,1,"Got these for daughter to wear w/a black dress. She has wide feet, so hard to fit. The base/sole portion of the shoe was perfect (8.5 wide) but with the elastic upper she felt footing was insecure. Would have been perfect if we could combine the wide sole with the regular top. Not the shoes fault, she's picky & hard to fit. I may see if there is a pair in my size :-)"
157328,1,"shoes are very light, comfortable and good price from amazon. just the look is not as nice as otehr shoes i like , but for the use purpose, thay are great."
15167,1,I have found that the Newbeat is more comfortable than the Sunbeat. This is a very good shoe for me to wear working in Retail. The arch seems to hit better than the Sunbeat.
346360,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
223790,0,"The shoe itself is decent. I've worn this style of Reebok for many, many years. Comfortable. Unfortunately, the high top is not high enough. The ultras, which are the high tops that I used to wear, are only available in very large sizes now and I can't wear them. They were high enough. Ah well, have to find another brand now that still makes the high tops high enough for me."
4055,2,"The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
293030,1,"Great Pair of boots, For All Day Comfort They really do compete with my ""Top of The Line"" Wolverines. I am on my feet 8hrs a day on with building maint. so the duties are everything from being a electrician one minute to a plumber the next, and it doesn't stop there.The only thing that they are ""Not"" is waterproof. But I used mink oil on them anyway, and they darkened up, but that made them look even better. They are not a Cold Weather -0F and below boot since they are not insulated for our Alaskan Winters. But our climate is changing so rapidly that they will be just fine in just a few years.I must say if you wear a 10.5 get a size 11."
260435,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
235384,1,"I've been buying these shoes since the 1990's and I love how comfortable they are. However, the last couple of pairs I got had soles that wore out quickly. I'm hoping this was a fluke and that the next pair I get will be better."
76362,1,"After reading the favorable reviews about arch support and comfort I was excited to try these shoes. I am not disappointed. The shoes are a narrow fit, which works well for me, and the arch support is superior. Leather is very supple and requires minimal time to break in. My favorite feature, however, is the little notch cut at the back of the heel so the shoe doesn't cut into my achilles tendon! Wow! All shoes should have this feature. Clearly these shoes are designed for dancing, which I appreciate as a retired ballerina, but this intelligent design will be appreciated by ladies who wear these as street shoes (which is my intent). For continuous street use you will want to take them to a shoe repair to add rubber soles/heels, however. The soles are designed for theater use and the attachment of taps."
366699,1,"I love these sandals. I got the brushed leather ones, and they are very comfortable. They have some arch support and all the straps adjust for a comfortable fit. I wear a 7.5 in most shoes and that is what I ordered in these. They fit me perfectly."

235368,1,Nicely made and soft leather shoe. Very comfortable and smart looking. Would recommend to all. A good price compared to the department stores.
216564,1,This product speaks for itself. These are very nice casual shoes and a rugged. It's great and is very comfortable and easy to put on.
240389,0,I recently had foot surgery and was looking for a nice wide plain sneaker. These are really cute but not wide enough. I would order the widest they offer. I will be giving these away and ordering the wider one. I really like them
97617,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
103912,1,"I bought this pair of shoes just one month and wear them everyday. They are quite fit my feet and even in a heavy rain can keep my feet dry. The shortcoming is that they are a littl ugly, I think."

Adidas sure did create a wonderful cleat!"
128488,1,"I have a no. 7 feet, and I found this shoe to be a little tight on the sides. Otherwise good product."
258925,1,As i was leaving feedback i accidently pressed the no answer instead of the yes answer. i just wanted to correct that and say that the sneakers were brand new and shipped on time
95941,1,"I am on my tenth pair of Enzo's. They are always in style, available in several colors, comfortable and most important to me............they come in my small size! My shoes were shipped promptly and packaged well. Very happy with entire transaction."
37531,1,Amazing as always can't beat a classic! I've always loved these shoes will buy them again and again forever! Great price to!
299243,1,My husband wanted a pair of crocs for an upcoming fishing trip. I purchased the XL for him as he's a size 10 1/2 - 11. They fit him perfectly and the color is just right (khaki). So far so good.....The crocs were put to use on a recent fishing trip and worked great.
140403,1,"i have owned several pairs of these! they are the best sandals i have ever owned. the last pair lasted over 2 years and i wore them when i walked in the breast cancer 3-day walk....yes, i wore them to walk at least 40 of the 60+ miles of the three day and my feet felt better than they did when i walked with expensive running shoes! what makes them so awesome is how they conform to your feet! they feel better than walking barefoot! enjoy!"
334049,1,I don't remember exactly how long I have owned my first pair of these boots but I know they are at least 6 to 7 years old and still going strong. They have been my daily wear boots for at least 5 of those years and have seen hundreds if not over a thousand miles. They are by far the most comfortable boots I have ever owned. The square toes give you plenty of room and the insoles are perfect. The soles are finally wearing through but are definitely still good enough for daily use. I use them for everything from hiking in the summer to snow blowing in the winter. I apply waterproofing (sno-seal) once a year and I have never gotten wet feet. I intend on using my new boots as more formal boots while still using my old ones for daily use. I simply cannot say enough good things about these boots!!!!
138455,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100.

230245,1,I love these loafers so much that they are my second pair! My first pair I wore out after 7 years. I wore a hole into them!
85780,1,"My second pair of these. I will never by another sandal. Great in the river, on the rocks, or in the backyard. You won't believe how light these shoes are, it's like you aren't even wearing shoes."
175669,1,"Naturalizer Scout ShoesI have been looking for another pair of these shoes for years now. Not carried in our local stores. I didn't know they still made them. I had two pairs which I wore until they wore out. I will be ordering more, so keep them stocked. I hope they keep making them! I have feet that are very hard to fit, so that the Velcro strap helps. So does the design and comfortable heels. But I mustn't praise them too much or you'll be all sold out next time I want to buy a pair."
288218,1,"These sandals are beautiful. I recently wore them from NY on the plane to the caribbean-it was a long day but they were very comfortable. I am so glad they have the wide sizes, I wish more sandals would offer that. I plan to buy them in every color."

Not all Keds are created equal, some have more support, better fitting; this shoe isn't one of them, but for messing around in the back yard, they are okay. For long time wear, spend more."
350690,1,"This shoe is quite fashionable, with the vamp design and heel. The leather looks somewhat cheap on this color but that is due to the dye/color. (I have this in Navy and the leather looks and feels like good quality). I find the shoe runs narrow across the instep, but it does tend to loosen up after a few wearings. The rubber-like, non-slip sole is great."
125561,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
339699,1,Love 'em and they arrived super fast! They are very comfortable even though they're chucks! Definitely going to order them in more colors!
164956,1,"My son really likes his cleats and says they are very comfortable. However, my son has only had the cleats for a little over a month and the elastic on the left foot that keeps the tongue down over the laces is starting to tear. Next time, I think we would order the shoes without this feature. Overall, he has been happy with the shoes. We have always had success with Adidas products."
377414,1,"I bought a pair of these for an exchange gift and was blown away by the product when it arrived. Other (Eddie Bauer) slippers I bought my hubby are 5 times the price, and he asked if he can trade for these. I've since order 3 more pairs as gifts. They are warm, soft and attractive. If people only knew, I'd guess these would sell out in a day."
265105,1,"I have arthritis in my hips and knees. I am on my feet, all day, every day working for Fred Meyer. I walk many miles, on hard floors and, it was getting so I could hardly walk at the end of the day. At the end of the week, I was ready to die. I purchased these boots on the first day of a vacation and, decided I'd wear them during the vacation to break them in, so I wouldn't have to go through the ""new shoe pain"" at work. Well, there was never any painful breakin period. The boots felt fantastic from the start. Now, my hips and knees don't hurt at work. At all! These boots have made a terrific difference in my quality of life. I went out today, and purchased another pair, so I can switch them out so they'll last longer, and get to air out. I can't say enough good things about these boots and, can't think of a thing negative to say, either. I, honestly, may purchase a third pair just for the heck of it."
10714,1,"I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot, the color, the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort. I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores."
139089,1,Although my wife only gave this shoe a rating of 4 she loves them! She actually purchased them to wear with a Disco costume. She received great comments on the shoes. The only thing she was disappointed in was that the shoe was not available in half sizes. I had to order one size up so the shoe was actually big. She has a narrow foot and the front of the shoe is very wide so her foot was slipping through the front. She said they were very comfortable and she was able to wear them most of the night.
130460,1,First things first...I AM NEW TO BALLROOM DANCING.The shoe seemed a bit expensive and I am glad I bought it a little large because the shoe is very snug fitting. I have no idea if should be that way or not but it is. Keep that in mind before you order. If you have wide feet you might want to look for a wide size if available. The shoe is nice and light and allows for controlled sliding across the dance floor.
189433,1,"These are a great pair of boots. I have been wearing Carolinas for years and have never been disappointed. I put them on and they felt they were already broken in. I would buy these again with no doubts. Plus, I ordered them from Hank's Clothing and they arrived in less than 48 hours! Highly recommend."
320976,2,"I ordered this shoes.I love them they are just beutiful.But when my babyhad to used them,shoes where coming off out of her ankle,while she waswalking.She had bad time.Also they where tight.I do not recommendStride rite/Abigail shoes.Thank you,C.rrroemrs"
185988,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
243886,1,"The shoe fit me well, and it came in the original condition - no damages, and it came on time."
219411,1,Anyone that wear Keds knows that they are great shoes. Got these for my wife and she likes them. Great looking shoes that offer solid support for you feet.
28710,1,"It's been over a year with these sneakers. Must say they've held up really well. Look really classic too. Probably the best pair of shoes I've ever had. They're not very athletic intensive but for casual games and use they're great. Awesome for just ""kickin' it""."
157367,1,My husband wanted these high topper slippers and I couldn't find them in any store this holiday season. Glad to see we could find them online. He loves them!
97628,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
215279,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
48671,1,"I love these boots. I got them to go w/a powder pink & black vinyl outfit and they are PERFECT! I would order a size up (as I did after reading the other reviews). I wear an 8.5 - 9, but got a 10 - perfection. Especially if you have high arches, as I do. Looks like they could scuff easily & I don't know wear to get baby pink polish! haha Just be careful cuz you're gonna wanna keep em for awhile. They're just SOOOO comfortable & supportive you'll wanna wear em all the time!"
200678,1,Product arrived faster than I expected and it was exactly what I expected it to be but it was too small for my son. So I returned it.
310723,1,"I purchased these boots for a friend and he said that I must submit this review. Per him, ""These boots were comfortable right out of the box. I worked 8 hours in the rain and was soaking wet and cold, but my feet were warm and dry. I highly recommend these boots."""
322602,0,"A ballet shoe is a ballet shoe is a ballet shoe. Plain and simple. But they need to be worn a while to conform to your feet. If you have never tried them before, don't try to figure out which is the left and which is the right, they look just alike. I have a wide foot. Reviewers said these ran large, so I ordered my regular size... figuring they would stretch to make the right width, and at the same time get a little shorter. But, they hurt right away since they were too long and narrow. I didn't want to suffer while breaking them in. Fortunately my husband remembered we had a shoe stretcher, so I put that on them, one at a time for a few hours. Now they are a comfortable width and length, and I'm sure they will soon conform completely to my foot."
198566,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
303054,1,"I've gone through quite a few shoes through the years but these are the best. In fact I also own the mountain bike version for off roading. The system is perfect for getting in and out of quickly. The comfort is superb. The first time(not recommended I suppose) I wore mine I did a fifty mile fun ride from Rosarito to Ensenada in Baja California without the slightest problem. I didn't even have to break them in! When you get around other bikers (not the motor type)you'll see that these are the shoes of choice as many people will be sporting them, and with good reason. They are super comfortable for walking in for short periods when off the bike for whatever reason. The rubber heal eliminates the annoying clack-clack sound that draws attention and sounds like you are walking in your wifes high healed shoes.The carbon material in the soles transfers the power effortlessly. You will feel no fatigue after hours in the saddle with these puppies underneath your dogs."
338221,1,"I ordered these for my now husband to wear for our wedding! They looked great and fit perfectly! Also, props to LastPairs for being the only seller with a men's size 13! That was a relief! Thanks!"
93606,1,"I have an Angel Pump in several colors and they are PERFECT for business or weekend wear. I have rec'd many compliments on this shoe, they are comfy and long lasting, I highly recommend the Angel Pump."
340740,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
278133,1,I have bought Hi-Tec Altitude shoes for a good 10 years and probably have purchased that many pair. Very comfortable to hike and work outside in. I have acreage and work for hours at a time thinning brush and the like and they always are comfortable.
176640,1,"I use these boots for my work as an arborist. They do well with spikes and on the ground in rough terrain as well. I agree with many of the reviews here. Do not even attempt to wear these working without a good set of insoles. With insoles, they do pretty good, especially for the money."
345408,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
4331,1,So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.
920,0,The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller.
338353,1,I love these boots.....Great pair of boots my 6 year old loves them and so do I! Good investment :-)
374253,1,Awesome boots. Super comfortable even though they aren't broken in yet. Hightly recommend these boots. My daughter has some too and loves them.
8180,1,"Durashocks are fairly comfortable. There's little apparent shock when walking on pavement, and for me a needed metal support shank. Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks, they pass in a business casual environment. One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots. They do tend to squeak on tile, though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow. I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet. When I bought a second pair, I bought them wide. The toe box is still narrow, albeit slightly wider than the D pair, but the rest of the fit is actually narrower. Unfortunately the wider size didn't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color (fine for a true work boot environment, unlike my office) and too short. Also, the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots."
208908,1,"I love Propet shoes. My feet love these shoesIf not for the Propet Visa Walker shoes, there would not be any daily 2 to 4 mile walks."
41538,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
193334,0,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
326650,0,I was upset when I got these shoes because I needed them to go on vacation and did not have time to order another pair. These shoes run a size small. I wear a size 10 and my heel was hanging off the end about a half in and they were too narrow.
381819,1,This is a very nice wallet-it works will for me.Thank You!I always get nice things from youall.I will buy again.
290940,1,These shoes are perfect. The fit is right on...a rare thing for narrow feet.
65735,1,These shoes proived to support for a hard game and have the looks of a street shoe. The perfect all around shoe.
243835,1,"What else can you say about a sneaker that has been around for over 90 years. These sneakers are simply great!!! I got the classic black high top and am very pleased with them. They are comfortable, durable and stylish. On a hot summer day the don't heat up like a bread oven, like some sneakers do, keeping your feet cool and comfy. If they do get dirty or funky you can simply toss them into your washer and bada bing like new!!! They offer enough support for me to last for a long day of walking around town or work. One of the coolest things about these sneakers is that they offer a ""back at ya"" response to the more expensive and mostly ugly ""skater"" and basketball sneakers. A great sneaker at a great price. I love mine!!!"
192894,1,"I am a nurse for critical care transport and needed steel-toed boots. When I was a volunteer with a busy EMS agency I had tried two other brands of steel-toe boots that were very uncomfortable, I'd come to believe it was just the price you pay for protected toes. When I tried these on I felt like I could jump up or down or run. They don't rub on my ankles or at the toes. I'm wearing them now and I'm not at work! They feel as comfortable as running shoes. We were out in the freezing rain/ice last night and they gripped the pavement well. The stretcher fell on my toe and it didn't hurt. I feel like I am better able to do my job, and my feet are much happier, in these boots! The online downside-the side zipper does not open very wide, I still have to unlace the boot to take them off. But overall I am extremely happy and would make this purchase again."
243303,1,"great shoe at a great price, classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit, fits snug so may want to size up"
202749,1,This is the first pair of Keens my husband has had and he is pretty pleased with them - so comfortable and hopefully no more smelly feet!!! Highly recommend them.
42647,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
98567,1,I was very happy to find this item on line. I was unable to find the size I needed in the store. It came to my house very quickly. Just what I needed.
310117,1,"I've always been sceptical when buying any clothing and footwear online. I've always wanted a pair of Chuck's. Got these, tried them on and I love them!"
327691,1,My daughter loves these shoes. Her favorite pair and wants me to buy her another pair.
130227,1,"The Clarks Delta Fashion Sneaker is a great value, especially at the price I paid from Amazon. The shoe is well-built, looks and feels good and the service to get it to me was excellent!"
143207,1,"I love Teva and there versatility our Daughter has wanted these for a while, we reward her with things she wants for her wonderful grades (proud momma) She is very happy with them and I also they are very durable and do not get those indents that some sandals tend to get and cause discomfort to your heels. She wore them all summer and they are always in her soccer bag to put on after her games. And fortunately they clean easily after a soccer match the odors are not that great with all there protective shin guards and polyester socks, if you are a soccer mom you know what that is like. Highly reccomend very happy teenager hard to do sometimes."
278545,1,"great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
110644,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
38691,1,This is the first pair of steel toe shoes that I have bought and I am happy with the quality. I don not have to ware them often but they are conferable. Only when I have to go out on the manufacturing floor. The insert of the shoe is not removable and is filled with a liquid so as you walk you can feel it move back and forth. It takes a little bit to get used to. I think once I break them in a little more they will feel better. The price is good to and I was happy that I could get them in my size easily.
57505,1,Keds is known for quality and this show will not let you down. The only negative is that I purchased extra wide and it was no different than the medium width. There was nothing that allowed for my Mother's wider foot to fit into.
225947,1,"En cuanto a calidad y precio Converse cumple con lo ofrecido, excelente calidad, durable y a la moda. Dispone para todos los gustos, edades, sin distincion, siempre innovadora"
280267,1,"I bought a pair of these as a gift and another pair for myself. They are very comfortable and sturdy, and they look great. The most striking feature is how warm they are! They are definitely more winter-wear than summer-wear. If you are looking to keep your feet warm, these are the best slippers on the market. If you are shy about foot sweat, not so much."
155141,1,"I loved this shoe. I've never tried Palladium before but this one deserves more than 5 star in comfort. It is stylish too. But it runs a little bit larger. I wear 7 and 37(Eur). I ordered 7, but it is more like 7,5-8 and it is tagged as size 38(Eur).Thanks to the side strap that I was able to tighten it!"
99071,1,"I always liked Converse shoes and since i moved to the Dominican Republic, i've gone thru my share of overpriced fakes. I'm happy that i can get these online now. I like having shoes that go along with any type of clothing or colour.....any!!!!So yes, these are great and one cannot go wrong in purchasing a pair unless u get the wrong size. I will definitely buy another or others in different colours. No regrets on this purchase."
305537,1,My Dad has very flat and painful feet. He has had quite a few surgeries on his feet. He says these shoes are so comfortable they are like slippers. That is high praise from him. At 87 comfort is very important to him. I highly recommend these shoes.
6626,1,"Great fit. I might need to have my eyes checked but I thought the tan/beige would be a little bit lighter than the picture shows, but I was still very happy with the purchase. Came really quickly in the mail and was packaged in original box."
76774,0,"I ordered these shoes knowing that Capezio means comfort. I actually wore them to a wedding in January and they were great. They looked wonderful with my dress. However, the 7W size was not wide enough. The shoe was rather narrow for &#34;Wide&#34; size. If you have a normal-size foot, then I highly recommend this shoe for a special occasion. They're made of leather and are therefore classy and comfortable.The size 7 was true to size, just not the width."
158470,1,Great pair of shoes with a lot of history. the only crappy thing is that i lost them... :Cthe shipping was quick and with a low price and yes... they were not avaliable for super saver shipping...Highly recommend them for everyone
273247,0,"I had ordered a black pair of this (along with 2 other pairs, different brands and models) using the amazon.com's shoe promotion (buy 80$, 20$ off). I am now returning the item. I had got the black pair. I don't know about the other pairs, but for this model in black I can say that the upper material is not leather as described. It is mostly (90%) fabric with small leather pieces where the straps come together. I was really disappointed since I was expecting shoes with leather upper. If you like fabric shoes, this might be for you, but be warned that the fabric is really stiff and my feeling is they would not extend. I regularly wear 7.5M in nine west, but since the upper material is fabric, the shoes would not extend, they are really tight in the front part. If you really want these shoes, I advice to order half size larger unless you have really narrow feet.Other than wrong description given here about the upper material, the shoes look overall above average and pretty. The sole is pretty stiff and would not bend. For some occasions these might be a good choice if you like fabric shoes, but otherwise it is not really for walking, or for long wearing. At least that was my first impression. Since i didn't wear these and am returning someone who actually owns a pair and is wearing may evaluate more accurately.Overall OK shoes. Would expect better from nine west though! That's why i gave 3 stars."
94378,1,"Years ago I was grounded by plantar fasciitis. My foot doctor recommended Birkenstocks. I live in them now. I can hike for miles, walk with gladness, and dance, get down and really dance, for hours.Don't get these shoes wet. The cork is much softer if you don't get them wet. I use different shoes in the rain or when I go in the ocean. (I live in Hawaii). The Birkenstock Rockford boots are waterproof and I use them when I have to travel to cold climates in the winter, and to take hikes anywhere. Birkenstocks have transformed my life. Plantar Fasciitis is a pain. I am grateful for these shoes.I size them at the local Birky store and order them for far less here. I still patronize the local Birkenstock store when I get new soles etc."
33600,1,"Ok, I'm 47- and a professional female - probably heading back to my 2nd childhood - um - if I ever left childhood completely in the first place?Anyway, I hadn't had a pair of Converse Hi-Tops since I was around 12 years old. I had seen some of the more ""artsy"" ones, but could never find my size (average foot)when I was looking...and I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them to work if they were ""artsy"" Converse - because they are, after all, athletic shoes.I decided to buy the completely black Hi-tops...and they are great. They are comfortable, even on my 47 year old feet. I really like them a lot. Glad I bought them, and maybe I'll even see about getting a pair of the Artsy ones...or maybe a pair in pink???Hope you'll enjoy yours, when you get them."
4883,1,"Very light but with plenty of cushioning. I am 6' and run my marathons at between 185 and 109lbs. 3:30 best, 1:31 best half marathon. My feet do what they want and I almost forget I have these on. I tend to wear my shoes on the outer side so i could use more high abrasion rubber there but I will buy these again."
380246,1,"This product is exactly as described -- I'm glad I listened to other reviewers and ordered a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear. Since the uppers are man-made material, they don't ""give"" as leather would. Capezio is a reliable manufacturer and I'd definitely order again from this vendor."
1186,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
262552,1,"I ordered these shoes two months ago. I was looking for some comfortable, durable shoes that I could wear for work. On the job I am on my feet most of the day and also do quite a lot of bending, stooping and getting down on one knee. As a result most shoes end up breaking down very quickly.I've been wearing these shoes nearly every weekday for the last two months for about 9 hours a day and they look great! I haven't polished them yet they keep a nice shine. There's no visible signs of wear yet One cheaper pair I had prior to this lasted about two weeks before the uppers started falling apart.I am SO glad I found shoes that were long lasting and still relatively inexpensive.1/1/2013 - Update: It's been 1 year since I bought these shoes. I wear them 5 days a week for 9 hours or more a day. As I said, my shoes get heavy use. After 1 year they are still quite serviceable. There a several scuffs and one crack in a seam which developed from always bending in the same spot..but it's not all the way through. The soles are still good and the interior is holding up very well. I've never polished them...in fact the only thing I've done in the way of maintenance is wipe them down with a paper towel every so often. I continue to be impressed! I'll be buying two pairs next time, one for work and one for church and more formal occasions. As a pair or church or formal shoes they should last for years."
33559,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
237398,1,They are a little to wide but otherwise they are great. I get to spread my toes on demi-point. I just hope they do not get to loose. I would recommend it to others.
130920,1,These shoes are teriffic. This is going to be my 5th pair.They surround your foot with cushioning and when you walk the air chamber in the bottom of your shoes is like floating along the floor. If you have to be on your feet just a shift readjusts the cushioning helping your feet from hurting a lot longer than any other shoe I have ever had.Great Shoe!!
226692,1,I have had the chucks for about a month now and there holding up well. I like the look of them there comfortable and simple ill be wearing them for a long time! :) If you are thinking of buying some chuck T's i would there pretty cheap and they can withstand some wear amd tear! Five stars
13446,1,"I have been a fan of Converse since the day I saw Will Smith unpack a brand new pair in the movie iRobot. I wanted one for myself, where else amazon is the best place to buy. The Product price is very affordable except the shipping and handling costs. They are a bit high to Sri Lanka. Would be great if they are low too."
254307,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
225859,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
100715,1,"As a crossdresser, it is extremely hard for me to find nice heels in a womens 13.5 that don't look like old lady shoes! These are fantastic, comfortable, and very sleek looking!"
152479,0,"Sanuk shoes are one of my favorite brands because they are so un-shoe-like. For those of you like me, who love to run around barefoot, Sanuks are just the right shoes for when you are required to actually wear a pair.So I wore out my last pair after a year & a half of consistent use & ordered this style. When the pair got here, I loved the pattern of the fabric, but I didn't completely love the shoe shape. My first pair's upper fabric was more comparable to a pair of flats--didn't come as far up my foot. I found the new pair's style kind of clunky and harder to get on my foot. But since I didn't want to buy an additional new pair, I just cut part of the lip off. It might sound kind of sketchy, but it's been working so far for me :DOverall, from my personal preference, I recommend the shape & fit of Sanuk Women's Shorty Sidewalk Surfer."
353930,1,I bought these boots for my son last Christmas. He has loved them since he took them out of the box. He said they wear great. These boots are going into their second winter here in Michigan and they still look great. These are great boots and worth every penny.
95047,1,They were what I was expecting. The shoes works well for my older grandma at 93.
14075,1,"Very comfortable, as described, high quality, warm, excellent for winter, bought one for my brother then my mother asked me to order it for her. She did not care that it listed for men."
357579,1,"Since I do not have normal feet (bunions and toes that aim outward) and I read that one reviewer had reordered a larger size twice for the perfect fit, I ordered one WHOLE size bigger than what I usually wear and they feel great! There's even enough room in them to add a Dr. Scholls pad. Getting them bigger insured that the widest part of my foot is right at the widest part of the shoe and I think that's what is critical to the comfort for me. I do not usually wear heels at ALL, so it will be interesting to see how they feel after I've had them on for a couple hours. But the quality seems good, so at this point I'm happy."
8649,1,"The boots have exceeded by expectations. Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville. I'm wearing them to work with slacks, polo, and dress coat. The smooth finish allows you to dress formal (suit) and also looks good with jeans. Being new, the lower section (foot covering) has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft. When worn for a while, the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture. The lower portion still shines more than the shaft. Unlike other boots, these have a sole with traction control. I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product. While wearing these boots six days a week (14 hr days), I have not noticed any foot, leg, or back pain. These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own. The ""break-in"" period was short. I recommended conventional black shoe polish. In 2011, I will order a second pair. It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option (tan) in this same boot. I hope this helps............."
161488,1,"This was the second time we ordered Pink Converse Shoes for my daughter, the first time I didn't get the size right. I returned them to ""Shoes R Us"" I think it was called and they took care of my mistake very quickly. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed so I ordered a replacement pair from Last Pairs. They came quickly, fit perfectly and were reasonably priced, the same as our local mall, without the hassle! Very good experience overall, would recommend."
102289,1,Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
17622,1,"I love this shoe and have purchased in the past. True to size and extremely comfortable. First time I wore them was for an all-day flight and evening appointment...they felt like ""broken-in shoes"" and are wonderful. HOWEVER, I do not feel the PEWTER color is correctly represented in this shoe. I think pewter should be more of a dull silver shade. These shoes are definitely more GOLD leaning towards bronze."
374665,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
159947,1,"My shoes arrived in record time, and look just great. I love the fact that they are all black. I have a thing about all black clothing, and these fit the bill. They are extremely comfortable and durable. I have 8 (9 if I count the pair that are on their way) pairs of Chucks and that is because they are great shoes with a unique style. You will love them, too."
260927,1,Thank you so much for your prompt arrival!! These were purchased as a gift to my best mate and the godfather to my daughter as he is a bit addicted to shoes! He absolutley loved them and put them on straight away! He found that the added spare pair of red laces was an added bonus! The size was perfect and the description exactly as advertised!Thank you again for your quick service and quality product!
2819,1,"I have a pair of Mizuno Wave Universe 3 running shoes that I had put about 750 miles on and had just noticed a hole in the left forefoot of the sole about the size of a penny. I was about to throw them away when I remembered that I had some Shoe Goo around and so I decided to do a little sole repair. I took out a pair of liners I had from other running shoes, inserted them into my Mizuno's and then applied shoe goo to the hole. After leaving it overnight, I ran with them the next day and they worked fine. I applied another coating (leveled off with a popsicle stick) after the run and now they're good to go. I hope to get another couple of hundred miles out of them.For a very inexpensive price, you can add many more miles and several months to your old running shoes. I've been using the product for over 30 years and think it's great."
141305,1,these are great sandals at a great price. i can even wear them when i am riding my motorcycle or I can walk around the park with them.
102087,0,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small. I should have gotten a 6 1/2 instead of a 6.THey look good though, isn't that what counts? haha!"
86568,1,"I decided to try these sandals as a possible replacement for the old Clark's Sunbeat, which no longer lives up to its former standard of quality, unfortunately. These have a very similar appearance and, if anything, are more comfortable. I thought I might dislike the look of the Velcro straps, but it's actually not very noticeable. They are very comfortable and, I thought, more attractive than they appeared in the picture (of course, I'm at an age where ""comfortable"" tends to be synonymous with ""attractive""). I downgraded them one star because the ankle strap tends to ride a little high on me, rubbing right underneath my ankle bone. I think when they get broken in and soften up a little, this will probably cease to be a problem, but for now, it's very irritating after awhile. Overall, though, I like this sandal and look forward to wearing it this summer."
192037,1,I love sanuks. I would have every pair for both me and my boyfriend if they wasn't so high!!! I have 2 pairs and ready to get a third!!
370409,1,"These boots are very nice! When I opened the box I was immediately impressed with their good quality. They were pretty stiff right out of the box and I am currently breaking them in.( I got them about 1 week ago) They hurt for the first 2 days or so then they started to get softer. They are breaking in really well. I love the sole and how it has no liner inside the boot. They are also priced really well. I have had different pairs of red wing boots in the past( red wing models, 4473, 2233, 952) and I think this boot is more comfortable and it costs a lot less. These boots exceeded my expectations and I would recommend them."
184575,1,"Goods received on time and in excellent condition, would certainly buy again. Thanks!!!"
223536,0,"The shoe itself is decent. I've worn this style of Reebok for many, many years. Comfortable. Unfortunately, the high top is not high enough. The ultras, which are the high tops that I used to wear, are only available in very large sizes now and I can't wear them. They were high enough. Ah well, have to find another brand now that still makes the high tops high enough for me."
289523,1,"best shoes i've bought. Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person, keeps your heel stable and supports. Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight.New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there, and in wide sizes. Highly recommended..."
254061,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
367527,1,You can't beat the price. My husband goes through shoes in 4-6 months so I love the fact that these look great and I don't mind throwing them away and getting a new pair when they're worn out.
359775,1,"These shoes are fine quality. They are VERY narrow and small. When ordering, order a size up, for sure! If your foot is the least bit wide, order a size up in wide. I don't know what scale they used to create these, but they are ridiculously small and narrow."
45312,1,"The all white shoes are cool and all, but the red and white ones are sweet. They look and play great. They don't slip on an indoor or outdooe court. These are the best looking and best playing shoes you can get for $85. You should buy two pairs; one for playing and one for just walking around."
140832,1,"I've always liked this shoe...yes, I am a man...and I've always wished they would bring out a ""man's"" version of it (a bit chunkier perhaps?). When I was a kid, we always used to clomp around in these traditional Japanese wooden sandals my Dad had brought home from Okinawa. I always loved the feel of that wood against my feet, and the sound they made, and ...well, anyways...They've always struck me as unisex...clogs are, right? My question is...can I just buy a larger pair that fit my feet and wear them...or would I look silly?"
113542,1,"converse I think has the best slip on in the world,, they are so comfortable and no laces, easy to put on I wear it all the time, IN fact its the only thing I wear (just stack of boxes)&lt;&lt; navy and the white onesoverall it fits my style"
228497,1,"I'm a converse wearing kind of girl, And these are my favorite by far! I have roughly about 10 pairs of converse they are the only shoes I wear. They we're affordable and so comfortable! Great buy!"
29800,1,I have worn Finn Comfort Women's Jamaika Sandals for at least 5 years. I previously suffered from plantar fasciitis and found I had a high arch. It was difficult to find a shoe to accommodate and support my foot properly besides a special tennis shoe. I prefer to wear slip on sandals and found the Finns at a specialty store. I wear them year round and have several pairs in different colors. They are so well made that they last for years and having the interchangeable insert is great. Love my Finns and so happy they are available on Amazon.
99505,1,"Very Comfortable and easy on & off! Great for walking and work ( I'm a Bus Driver)! Also, very good on wet surfaces!!!"
201072,0,"Came in a timely manner, correct style and size but the color looked different online. Still happy with the color. Very happy with the quality and price!"
109117,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
221714,0,"This is a great boot right out of the gate but check your soles, if you look at sites like Backcountry and REI you will find that like myself a growing number of fugitive owners are seeing the soles separate from the upper with little to medium use! the comfort and support are present but the durability is in question here!"
292893,1,This was a Christmas present for my son. He loves and wears Chuck Taylor All Star OX shoes. He has several pairs.
184911,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
228852,1,"Awesome, cute, adorable shoes. Just as shown in picture. Fits true to size. Comfortable. If you love Polos and sneakers, these are great."
99958,0,I was a bit disappointed because one shoe had the leather nice and smooth and the other one was wrinkled. Hopefully the smooth one will get wrinkled enough so that eventually both shoes will look the same.
244973,0,"This shoe seems sturdy enough, but is a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I ordered them according to the size chart, but it definitely measures bigger than what it says on the chart. And the sole doesn't seem to be very sturdy. I don't know until my son's feet get big enough to wear these shoes, but it sure doesn't seem like the soles will last very long."
247473,1,"I have another pair for outside, cold. I want another one of these for in and out of car and office and home visits for winters in Minnesota. They are boots, not too warm in the car, office, or people's homes, but with pants look more like a shoe and less like a boot! I'm buying another pair."
223308,1,"These are the best shoes I have ever worn in any sport. I play senior ""over 50"" slow pitch softball and the cushion in these are gentle on old knees. Several ladies on the team bought them and all rave about them."
79608,1,bought these for my wife... she's been wanting a pair of low-cut red chucks for a while. Ordered these for Christmas and they came quick with no issues.
378372,2,"Overall, these shoes really didn't live up to my expectations. The bottoms of the shoes are made of a weird material and they slide around really easily. Also, I ordered a size larger than my street shoe and they were to big, so I would only go half a size up."
330438,1,"well made, smelled sooooooo go out of the box. Alittle more raisen colored than I had first thought but it looks exactly as it does in the picture. Pretty comfortable and formal"
240416,1,"As far as I'm concerned, this shoe is perfect. I bought the black with white laces. I can wear it every day, it's cute, it's comfortable, and it's inexpensive. It goes great with capris, boot cut jeans, skinny jeans, and slimfit pants. You can wear them with or without socks, but I prefer the liners (no shows) with these. I'll admit that I'm newer to the Keds brand as an adult and so I can't comment on how much more comfortable they used to be ""back in the day."" I wore this brand as a kid and to me they feel exactly the same as they once did. I've probably become pickier in my older age and I still find these to have adequate support though they are quite thin. I had been buying Vans brand shoes that look very similar to these for years, but was getting tired of paying $50 for them. I don't know how long these will last, but seeing as they are inexpensive, I won't mind if I only get a year or so out of them. One more quick note: these are very feminine for such a plain shoe. They're thin and make my feet look a little bit smaller than they really are. I don't have big feet (7.5), but I still like the effect."
69460,1,"I am not able to go barefoot because of some heel pain. I work in the kitchen a lot at home and this was causing pain in my feet. I looked into purchasing those gel mats for the kitchen but they are very expensive, someone suggested getting crocs as kitchen shoes! Perfect."
198306,1,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
341816,1,"I have five pair of these slip ons. They are great, comfortable and easy to put on. Highly recommened for a comfortable summmer shoe OR all year."
129182,1,"I have always been a Sak fan, but this bag takes the cake! Large enough to fit diapers, wipes, sippy cups, etc, and it is small enough to use when out on the town (without the kids). I bought this in black, and it matches just about everything. The material is easy to clean, just rub it with a cloth and warm water. I spilled red wine on it and it came right out. It is not a heavy bag, and it has plenty of pockets inside for storage. It even includes a cell phone side pocket. I recommend!"
35734,1,"i've a 4 years old daugther that love the pink color, so when she saw the shoes, never want to wear anything else. I think that she feel very confortable with her new Converse All Star. She make me remind my chilhood, when i use to wear my own."
136818,1,Arrived in 2 days.Still the same wonderful shoes I remember from high school 25 years ago.
267977,1,Top of the line work boot for the man that wants comfort with a fair price
130361,1,The product arrived amazingly fast (practically overnight) in perfect condition. I would recommend these folks to anyone!!
337177,0,"Just purchased my second set of these boots. I love them, but this pair has the same issue as the first pair. I wear a wide size. The left boot is more narrow than the right. I don't have this issue with any other set of boots so it's not that my left foot is wider than my right. It takes a month or two to stretch out depending on how much you wear them. It's very annoying until then. I've have a friend at work that wears these same boots as well, and he has the same issue. They will widen out but it's a big pain until they do."
123843,1,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
361166,1,These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air. I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase). There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.
91966,1,"I purchased my 1st pair of the Kia Wah Bay boat shoe while vacationing in the Finger Lakes of NY. At that time, I thought they were extremely comfortable, with just enough supporting arch to make wearing them all day enjoyable. I also was pleased to note that they were available in Wide - I was able to get the 9 1/2 W instead of the normal-width 10 that I usually have to deal with. There was no break-in period at all. I just started wearing them all day, every day on that vacation.The 1st pair lasted over 2 1/2 years of daily wear, and finally tore out along a seam. I liked them so much that I immediately ordered another pair - just a different color. They do come in tan, brown, dk brown (chocolate), and gray. For casual attire at work, I chose the brown.They're not water-proof - so don't expect to be dry when it's pouring outside. This wasn't a surprise to me and I don't consider it a negative but the info should be included in any review.I'll buy another pair unless they are discontinued before then!"
58017,1,These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer. They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet.
289181,1,Comfortable and good shock resistance. Waterproof. Not the prettiest shoe in the market but very functional and a sensational price!
216319,0,"This are made like a typical house shoe. Just be warned they run about a full size larger then I wear, so go bigger when purchasing. Other than that they are nice looking shoes."
45936,1,"I really like the way the shoe feels, I would have given it a 5 if it had better arch support (My other experiences w/ Propet they all had great support). The foot bed on this sandal is flat. It does not feel like it will pinch or give blisters. I have only worn it around the house so far to see how they will be."
298929,1,"I bought this for my husband who is a dogwalker. This holds everything he needs while dog-walking - phone, keys, extra ""poop"" bags and there's even room to tuck a small scooper in the 2 straps on the back of the bag. And his hands are free to control the leashes & do everything else his furry charges need him to do!"
4495,1,"I just received my boots today, about 4 days after ordering. Shipping was very fast considering it was free. I'll be honest, when I first put these boots on, I literally thought ""What the hell did I just buy?"" I decided to walk around in them in a bit, because I read that they require some break-in. Well, after wearing them around the house for only a couple hours, they already are starting to feel extremely comfortable. I will test these boots out in the field as soon as possible and report back. My initial impressions are that these boots are an extreme value at only $[...]."
147757,1,so soft and comfortable!! you wont wanna take these off even wen the wather gets warmthey are soooocomfortable. now i know why everyone wears them.
120851,0,"I was incorrectly fitted for this shoe at my local running store, so I can't give a very thorough review. What I can tell you to be aware of is the width: I normally wear a medium or B, and in this shoe I should've been in a narrow or A. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until I aired a few complaints at a different running store and the salesclerk had me try the narrower width. It fit like a glove, and imagine it would've been perfect.I also required a 1/2 size larger than my street shoes, but this is fairly common with running shoes.That said, there are some things I really like about this shoe: the upper is mostly mesh, which makes it nice and light for a trainer, and very breathable. Combined with Thorlo CoolMax socks, I had no sweaty feet issues, even in the summer.The shoe is also very supportive for those with mild overpronation and medium to flat arches. Toe-off felt muddy to me, probably due to the width, but the shoes had great cushioning and seemed to provide good shock absorption.They also didn't seem to require any breaking in. Ready to go out of the box, as it should be.Overall, this is certainly a shoe worth trying on. I trained for and ran a half-marathon in mine. Just be wary of the width."
173612,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
218291,1,"These shoes look good, they feel good, and they don't cost much. If you're feet are strong enough, you can even run in these (I do)."
98398,1,We purchased these boots for our 17 year old son and he loves them. They are very durable and nice looking at the same time. Well worth the money!
50741,1,"I got everything in time, in perfect condition. Thank you so much! I'll definitely be making more purchases in the future."
66437,1,"I bought the green shoe. First, it's really good but I mainly run on the hard concrete so it probably wasn't the shoe for me.I can't tell you how well it works off road, but on the road, my knees take a beating due to the lack of padding. These shoes definitely weren't designed for distances of over two miles on the road. Right now, I mainly use them for sprint workouts which they excell at. They are very flexible and lightweight so it's almost like running barefoot and is excellent training for calf muscles.I haven't got a chance to use the spikes but without the spikes, they have traction on snow and ice due to the metal on the bottom."
85901,0,i am having trouble with my amazon orders i am still waiting for a bible tote i ordered in early june and have paid for. i ordered some crock shoes and got a double order and sent back a reply on this no responce .i like o order amazon things but have now stopped till it replys to my email on my wrong order also about my binble tote i ordered in early june . loretta bickle
353322,1,First time i ordered a shoe that was the correct size! and they feel good and look great! I would order from Evansagain!
160902,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
333410,1,"Bought these shoes two years in a row for my dad because he likes them so much. Dad's input: very comfortable, classic style, and unlike his other dress shoes, they are very, very light!"
229772,1,"I purchased these for my 15 year old for Christmas, he is very rough on shoes but so far the shoes are standing up well. The black is a bit more 2 toned than the picture seems to show so the leather on the shoe is more of a dark brown than a black."
219395,1,These are cute keds. My daughter has size 11 feet so it is hard to find shoes to fit her. These were just what she was looking for
111145,1,"This boot has been an excellent purchase. I have had the opportunity to use it in 5 degree weather with packed and fresh snow and never had a problem. The traction, warmth, and overall comfort were great. Not once did any water get through and the gore-tex lining allows sufficient breathing. Used these boots right out of the box and walked a total of ~25 miles with no blisters or discomfort. I would definitely purchase this product again."
333340,1,"best shoes i've bought. Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person, keeps your heel stable and supports. Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight.New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there, and in wide sizes. Highly recommended..."
321665,1,These moccasins are awesome. They are my go to shoe for around the house and running out to the store.Extremely comfortable - they feel like slippers!Would highly recommend.
245256,1,These shoes are comfortable and very sturdy. I like them a whole lot. They are kind of big clunkers of shoes.
29824,0,"I also own the leather ones in this style, and I love them. But the quality in the ""croc"" leather is just not the same. I would buy the shoes again in the leather, but never in this ""croc""."
154070,1,These are the most comfortable sandals I have ever had. I have two young kids and am on my feet all day. These sandals are perfect for busy moms that want a cute sandal that will stand up to a lot of walking and chasing kids.
130008,1,"Fue una muy buena compra, excelente calidad, tallas ideales, lindos dise&ntilde;os actuales. Recomiendo a todoas a comprar este producto, se llevar&aacute;n una buena sorpresa y le encantar&aacute; si es un regalo para alguien."
338166,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
179827,1,"These shoes are fun cause you can wear them different ways. I like to fold them down and only lace them halfway. These shoes are great and they fit awesome, which I understand is a problem with some Converse shoes that are unisex. I am a size 9 in women's and I got a size 7 in men's and they fit great. Definitely want them in more colors, but the black is good with everything. Great casual shoe!"
343361,1,"When I put them on, they were comfortable and fit well from thebeginning, I like them a lot. They also look good on the footand feel good . I wear them quite a bit."
48588,1,"These are the only shoes my feet will wear! They are supportive, comfy and perfect for someone who has to be on their feet all day!"
44363,1,"My son loves the shoes and we were very happy with how quickly they were shipped out, especially when we ordered last minute before school starting. Thanks."
170871,1,I buy my son black chucks every year. They are classic and cool and the price can't be beat. They run large so make sure you size down 1/2 size to a full size. They do not come in half sizes so my son who is a size 13 wears a 12 and they fit great.
128697,1,"My girlfriend received them as a X-mas present. She loved them and wore them everyday. She said they fitted like a glove on her feet. Also, they are really durable. The velvet-like texture of the front and sides does not lose its color...Recommended..."
20598,0,"When I saw these shoes I thought they were cute.... I got the pink pair. They are cute ... BUT I havent seen these before and it looks to me like in the image that the shoes are white and pink with a pink sort of design on them. But, the ""design"" is actually like cracks and like a greenish/silver color to it, not pink. They are cute still, but I would not have gotten these if I wouldve known what they really look like. I dont know how else to explain it. I hope it was helpful"
148155,1,These shoes are extremely comfortable and accomodate my orthopedic inserts. I can also open and close the Velcro flaps with my grabber - necessary since my hip replacement.
101958,1,"As a crossdresser, it is extremely hard for me to find nice heels in a womens 13.5 that don't look like old lady shoes! These are fantastic, comfortable, and very sleek looking!"
162011,1,"I brought this for a gift to my brother and he's very happy, his really a good shoes!!!"
328283,1,"I like this shoe and use it as my housework shoe. However, the interior padding is just a very thin piece of not very good foam so I will want to get inserts. Right now they fit fine.....hope they still fit well with inserts. They are very cute and the service was great."
314128,0,Well after spending $85.00 on a pair of boots that were supposed to be a wide width I then had to take them to a shoe shop twice to have them stretched before I could even wear them.I will deffinately buy these kind of boots from in store before ordering online again. They were just so narrow they were almost going to go back but I decided to spend the extra dollars to have them stretched and thank god it worked or I would have been out alot of money. I suggest if you want to buy Timberlands go to a store and try them on first!!!
18999,1,These AK shoes are very beautiful. For the price I paid they are well worth it.
155573,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband to wear at work. He is on his feet and walks quite a bit and he says they are comfortable. As long as you take care of them they will last for a long time. These shoes are dressy enough to wear with a suit but casual enough that you could wear them with khakis as well. They are true to size and fit my husband's wide feet nicely. Nunn Bush is a great brand and these shoes are good quality. If you have wide feet and are looking for a durable, nice-looking shoe these shoes won't disappoint."
375351,1,"I purchased a pair of Bates lace to toe boots a few years ago and have worn them until the leather cracked. The biggest reason why I purchased the Bates (which are similar to these Danners) is because of the ability to have them resoled. However, I cannot send the boots back to Bates to be resoled, I had to find a cobbler in the area who could resole the boots. Because I cheat when shining the boots the leather eventually cracked.I've wanted a pair of Danner's for quite some time. I have only worn them on shift four times and the boots are comfortable for being brand new and the thickness of the leather. I used neatsfoot oil on the boots before wearing them to help soften the leather just a little bit. Obviously they were stiff when wearing them the first time, but they are breaking in the more I wear them.I spit shine the boots and the toe of the boots hold the shine really well. Plus it doesn't take much to put a shine on them either. I typically brush shine every where else. The instep of the boots are a little difficult to brush shine, so I have to hold the brush a little differently. Otherwise, they brush shine and spit shine really well and very easily.The soles of the boots are quiet when walking on lenolium, tile or even the wood laminate floors (they don't squeak) and I have a heavy foot step so the soles of the boots make my footstep very quiet when completing building searches. I haven't run in the boots yet and don't know how they will react to running, but I'm certain they will be ok. The soles are wider than the boots because of the construction and if you're not careful about where you step, you may catch the sole on something. Otherwise they are an excellent pair of boots.Plus, I can send them back to Danner to be reworked!"
179192,1,"We have found that by shopping on Amazon we are able to obtain all manner of items that we would not be able to purchase normally. My husband is 6'6"" tall and is a big man with big feet as you would expect. He wanted to buy these particular shoes as they were something that he had worn in his childhood and loved so much. We were not able to buy these in Australia without actually having them especially made. Phil's foot size is normally 14 wide, so we opted for the size 15 US. Absolutely perfect and for a very reasonable price.We are very happy and even though some items are way out of our purchase league due to the varying shipping costs, we are still very fortunate to have discovered Amazon."
334487,1,These shoes are the best. They are so comfortable and really cute. I got the lilac patchwork ones and I wish I had gotten a couple of more colors before they sold out.
35423,0,For some reason it was not the right size so I am rating it 3 Stars because of that. The shoe itself looked well made but the aggravation of having to return the shoes and therefore not keep them makes this 3 Stars (average) rating. Please do not let this rating deter anyone from buying the right size. Thank you.
385272,1,These sneakers are comfortable from the moment you put them on. No break in period required.
122430,0,I purchased these in a 7.5 wide but when I got them they didn't feel like a wide shoe even though that is what it said on the box. Better to buy shoes in person I guess.
284690,1,I bought my Rainbows after a friend told me about them. I love them and I've only had them for a few days. I will definitely be recommending these to all my friends. They are worth every penny!
33384,1,"We bought these as ""water shoes"" to use in Jamaica for one of my boys, and they have turned into his favorite warm weather shoe. They are very durable, and well made, and generally comfortable. Occasionally he does get a little irritated in the ankle area, but that goes with sandals. Great value and a great show. Highly recommended."
377887,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
5767,1,"I know I wear these shoes more often than I should, there are days when I should probably wear dressier shoes, but I wear one of my pairs of Easy Spirit Motions Sport Lace-ups everyday because they are so comfortable. They seem quite durable too."
328079,1,I do not like flip flopsI purchased to replace a previous pair I used for the last couple years.
834,1,This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots.
192126,2,I bought my son Teva's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out. I emailed Teva's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen. Last summer my active son's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother. Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some.
57930,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
134388,1,Boots are made in a solid manner. I expect years of solid use.? There is not much of an insole. The boot has very little arch support. The neck is thight on the boot. My foot has a hard time making it to the bottom of the boot. The boot has a wide toe area. Don't expect the boot to be long. Choose your normal length. The boot should last for years. The boots came quickly from the vendor.
358489,1,"This shoe is awesome. If you appreciate the kitten heel and added stability of an ankle strap, this saucey little dancing shoe is for you. Always order 1/2 size up and consider the wide version if you don't like the feel of a form fit, these babies are very slender and run small. I'm wearing these to work and out dancing with the boyfriend and they've been fab so far. love them!"
59077,1,"I have several pair of New Balance shoes that I wear when running. When I saw the 574 line, I thought that the shoes would be great to wear to work. When I got the shoes, I was a little surprised that the back of the shoes were reflective, but otherwise the shoes were exactly what I expected. They are typically comfortable for NB shoes. I stepped right in and had no issues. I would have liked them better without the reflective surfaces and the big &#34;N&#34; on the side (after all, I am wearing them to work), but I do like them and will be wearing the to work. I typically put in a lot of walking time at work, so I have to have comfortable shoes and I really cannot get away with the typical sneaker look. So these shoes should work well for me."
98679,0,"size was not true to us sizing,so a send back and reorder was required."
70294,1,"I also read the reviews of previous buyers. Due to the issue of the size, I bought one and half size larger (8M) than my real size (6.5M, sometimes 7M). Eventually, this boot is perfect for me! The quality of this boot deserves more than $40, in my opinion. If you buy about one and half larger size than your normal size, you would be happy to own this boot."
95314,0,"I ordered a 40, what was supposed to be a women's size 9, but these were way too big. At least 2 sizes. I found a store that sold these and ended up with a size 38. I was told by someone else they had the same problem. Now that I know my correct size I would have no problem buying these again."
223793,1,And everybody told me I'd never find them again..... Who knew? These have always been my favorite and I don't care how many people are jealous! These are rock-in Bad-ass!
260839,1,My 23 y/o son asked for these for Christmas and he was ESCATIC! He loves them so I guess this would be a positive review! Shipping was fast and came in great condition.
286655,1,"Good product - good price. If you're purchasing other items and need long laces, order these. What else can one say about shoe laces?"
82223,1,Ordered these on the recommendation of my best friend. She has been wearing hers for about 8 years and loved them! They were a little tight but I have a wide foot. It didn't take long for them to stretch. I wear them about 16 hours a day. They have to be the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned! I'm thinking about ordering another pair just to have a spare.
269537,0,This is not the shoe that it replaced. It is not as comfortable and the shoe strings have trouble staying tied. I know of one other person who has similar shoe and he has trouble with the strings also. I would wish that previous quality was revived. By the end of the day I feel as if I can feel every thread in my shoe as well as the inner sole.

290637,1,"The Rockport Prowalker is the nearest thing to perfection in a walking shoe. It's light weightyet very sturdy, it has a timeless look aboutit and yet it provide real comfort. I've wornRockports for 15 years and will continue becausethere is nothing better on the market.JimB"
260086,1,this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had.Thanks
281854,1,Little low for me but comfortable when totally inside.I think I must wear them naked the first few days because I cannot get in with socks. It's too low for me.
77034,1,Glad I found these shoes. They were what my grandson was looking for. They seem to be of very good quality and the fit was exactly in the size offered. I would recommend ordering this shoe or others made by Adidas.
120976,1,Great looking western style leather slippers - beachy with a south-western flair. Comfortable. stylish and made to last a very very long time.
36243,1,"I purchased these boots to use for shorter day hikes and for wearing around town in winter, because it will be easy to have them resoled down the road...not so much with my Lowa Trekkers. I have a narrow, lower volume foot with a narrow heel, and have inserted PowerSteps insoles in my pair of boots. This helped fill in some of the volume, and made the boots quite comfortable. However, the heel cup is still a bit wide for me and I'm probably going to have to add some moleskin/padding to secure my foot more.I've had the boots for a little over two weeks now, and they're finally breaking in some. I say finally because I wore them for too long at first, and developed a few blisters before I knew it. Since then I've taken it more slowly and they are starting to feel great. I did encounter the blister over my Achilles tendon as mentioned by others, and think this was mostly due to my foot not taking up enough volume in the boot.They're nice looking boots that offer some warmth and dryness, and are easy to resole. If you're wanting some tough boots for day hiking, then you might want to try on a pair."
260660,1,"Been wearing converse for years; great shoes, came just as promised in the picture and description. Cheaper, even with the shipping expenses, then in the stores where you can find all black chucks. Shoes packaged very well; shipping was ridiculously fast, had it in two days; great amazon experience!"
48543,1,Great fit. Good shoes for knocking around the house. Warm. Came on time and in perfect condition.
82860,1,"I love love these Reef Ginger flip flops! I already have a pair but I wanted to order another as a back up pair. This is my 3rd pair and they are my go to comfortable cute black flip flops! I'm a 6 1/2 in normal shoes and I take a 7 in these and they fit perfect! Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for comfortable, cute, black flip flops!"
126770,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
68628,1,"I work outdoors in all types of weather, and finding comfortable, waterproof shoes is always a top priority for me. These boots meet my cold-weather needs. My feet were always cold in my other boots, but these are incredibly warm and comfortable.Because of the high wear my work shoes receive, I usually go through a pair of boots every three months and then it's time for them to be replaced. These boots have lasted 6 months so far, and their condition is not too bad at this point.I have re-waterproofed them twice so far, but that's typical for all my boots. I recommend the Sorel boots highly!"
183293,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
385276,0,I bought these pair a half size too big to make sure that they were comfortable work sneakers that didn't look too much like sneakers. Unfortunately I will be either regifting these to someone with smaller feet or returning em. Look and feel are ok for the price but I was not expecting them to feel like I was trying to fit into a womens size sneaker.
340927,1,These are by far the most comfy slippers I have owned-and a great price.I bought my mom and sister both a pair.
143661,1,I live in my sneakers so comfort is a must and these met my expectation especially for the price. Good buy for a good sneaker.
381101,1,"I've been wearing this shoe longer than I care to remember. I think this is my third or fourth pair - not because they wear out too soon but because I know when I buy them that I will be able to get several years of supportive wear out of them. They clean up easily, they have long lasting support, and they continue to be comfortable wear after wear."
207905,1,"I'm normally a rock-solid size 7, size 6.5 is perfect in these. I own the natural and the metallic multi. I love them both. Only thing wrong with them now is the teethmarks. Now that the pups are grown it's time to buy more. As much ventilation as these have, I can't figure out why it is that the natural seems to breathe better than the metallic multi, but it does. I love sandals but I'm not too good at keeping my toes painted; this is the answer!"
289712,1,"I took a chance ordering dress shoes from Amazon for the first time. Sizing is the concern for Internet shoe sales, and will continue to be.The quality of the stitching and leather on this shoes is very high. They look as nice in real life as they do on the website. Excellent shoes."
43484,1,"I wasn't too sure about these at first. They felt heavy and stiff, but once a wore them for a short time, they felt great. Definitely not a lightweight shoe, but a good solid ""off trail"" shoe. They do seem to run a little wide, but good for extra room for hiking socks."
163730,1,These shoes are great and comfortable for my daughter. Just be sure to order about 1 1/2 size UP with these. We ordered a 13 1/2 for my daughter and they were VERY tight! She needed a size 2 to have a little space in there.
261918,2,"As soon as I opened the box, the boots looked cheap and had a strange plastic smell. It was leather but it didn't smell like it usually does. When I put them on, they felt even cheaper. They were way too shiny and even with much pre-bending where the toe meets the metatarsal, it developed multiple creases within a couple of days. They were not comfortable at all and I had to put some insoles to make them bearable.The heel was some hard material, not rubber, and I felt like a clydesdale with every step. I know women like to sport the sound of their expensive shoes, but no one likes to advertise when the shoes look cheap. I even used a scrubber to matte the finish and it looked respectable but the creases gave the cheapness away. Thank goodness it was a rainy patch of weather and I could tell people they were my rainboots. I am not a shallow person but this product was so cheaply made, it was embarassing. I bought a similar zip-up boot at Macy's for more than double the price and they look great after 3 months. These looked awful within 3 days. I thought I could save some money but now they sit there in my closet to remind me-don't buy shoes online and it's worth it to pay extra for quality."
172973,1,I have purchased this same shoe in 3 colors over the years.I love Mocs and especially those made of deerskin or moose hide as they are supple and conform to the contour of you feet and then fit like a glove.I say - buy them.
352288,1,"They're not much to look at, but these boots are among the most comfortable I've ever warn. From day one, without any breaking-in. They show every sign of being as robust and durable as claimed, too, though I have so far had little opportunity to put that to the test. Definitely worth the money."
164899,1,I used to buy these shoes 15 years ago---their quality has not changed .Still a good fit & made very well.
85383,0,"I like the style and fit of the shoe. However, one small finishing detail is hard to overcome - the roughness of seaming of the leather trim at the heel rubs blisters. Deliberating giving oneself blisters when trying to break-in the shoes, doesn't make one enthusiastic about wearing them."
339727,1,"I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!"
19543,1,I found these to be a perfect fit. They are very comfortable and great for those long shopping trips. Look very nice with both casual dress and jeans.
272701,1,"Pretty updated flipflop shoe. I like the crisscross style & the sole has some cushion which makes it more comfortable. It stays secure on my feet. The only thing it doesn't have is arch support, so I wear these less than an Orthoheel or Birkenstock which is my typical summer shoe."
311512,1,I love Reebok so much. The shoes are so comfortable and the other stuff is also really great! All my friends and I have at least 6 pairs of reebok shoes in our closets. And the designs are really great too.
13770,1,"Love these moccasins! Just as comfortable and versatile as one would expect! Goes with Jeans, shorts or a casual dress."
115263,1,Cool shoe for a teen boy and great price. Great gift - what they wanted... I would recommend getting them.
27423,1,These boots are cute and comfortable - very good for winter hiking in cold climates like New England.
169428,1,"When I first got these, the left shoe was significantly smaller than the right, but after about a week of breaking it in they are finally comfortable. I would definitely purchase these shoes again, but probably not online, mostly because of sizing issues. If you can't go somewhere to try them on, you should probably buy up to a full size smaller than you normally wear. Don't worry if they are tight, they stretch. I bought a full size smaller and they fit perfectly after breaking them in!"
282370,0,"Based on previous reviews about these running big, I ordered my 'normal' size 11 knowing a bit big is far better than a bit small. When the shoes arrived, they were very snug. I had to return and order a half size larger. (good thing Amazon's ordering/return system works so well) Receive the 'right' size as promised. The shoes are pretty comfortable but do have a few quirks. First off, there is a slight pinch on the top of the big toe where the leather bends while walking. Secondly, there is a decided 'pop' in the leather with each step, again in the toe area as the leather bends then relaxes with each step. I'm hopeful that once worn a bit, both issues will remedy themselves. The shoes are very nice looking and I've had several compliments on them already. The toe pinch does seem to be going away and I hope the popping sound does as well. The shoes appear to be very well made. They are not light as the sole seems to be very durable. All in all, I'm glad I ordered them as I expect them to be great shoes. Just not the slipper feel I'd hoped for, but are very comfortable none the less."
134482,1,These cant be beat for the price. I really like these sandals and would likely purchase them again. They fit well and were supportive.
282978,1,"I just purchased my 4th pair of these shoes. They are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn over the years, and they wear like iron with the following exception. The soles of the shoes cracked right through the instep. The first pair cracked well over 2 years after I purchased them, with the second pair cracking just over a year after purchase.I wish this company would get wise and revise the shoe sole so it wasn't prone to cracking. Had the last two pair re-soled at my local shoe repair and now use them for all manner of yard work. They are a great walking shoe, and nice enough looking to wear out for shopping and running errands.I do recommend them with the above caveat in mind. If you don't wear any one pair of shoes for a long time then it may not matter to you. Me, well I keep and wear my shoes forever, and by that I mean years so it is irk-some to have this happen to a shoe you love. However irk-some it is, I will continue to buy this shoe because their pluses far outweigh the negative and that negative can be corrected."
183414,0,Looked like a well made shoe but I would prefer made in the USA. I ordered a size larger than what I'm wearing and I could not get into them. The were way to tight across the instep and I had to return them which was flawless thanks to Amazon.
122237,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
116077,0,"True to size but really wide, other wise good quality. Also nice pink color. I don't recommend them unless your are in need of some width."
144853,1,"It's just fine as UGGs should be. Be sure you READ the instructions when washing them cos if you use the washing lotion directly to the shepkin,Uggs'll just fade.Mine's go tten a little bid lighter though."
59827,1,They are comfortable and fashionable at the same time! I'm very hard to fit - 7.5 W -- and these are perfect!
330038,0,"I got this on sale for a really good price. I have always been a fan of Adidas shoes but I thought I gave Converse a try for the good price. Currently, I also wear Adidas Team MAC 2, which I bought for a few dollars more than the Converse. The Team MAC 2 defnitely has much better feel and support, especially when landing after a jump. I have worn Nike, Reebok and other brands of basketball shoes of about the same price and the support provided by the Converse is only average. For example, the tongue of the Converse is thin while the Adidas is breathable mesh and much thicker. I feel like I am wearing a cheap, store brand basketball shoes with the Converse. Don't let the ICON system fool you, it doesn't do anything special and is no comparison to Adidas's AdiPRENE+, Torsion System and A3 Structure. In my opinion, Adidas has the best fit, feel and support for about the same price. I currently own 4 pairs of basketball shoes and one pair of running shoes. All are Adidas with A3 or AdiPRENE+. All are remarkably comfortable. I know, but they were all on sale for very low prices. So I stocked up."
165551,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever made and they look very conservative. I have them in several colors because they look good with slacks or skirts. They hold up well with everyday use and are lightweight so they pack well. If you try one pair, you keep coming back to them for your basic wardrobe."
332916,1,"They're your standard crock, for much cheaper than i can find in the store. Thank you amazon!"
350346,1,"These sandals are incredibly soft and comfortable but I ordered a 9.5 M (which is what I almost always wear) and they are too long (almost a whole size too long). BUT, I may actually keep them because they were $35 w/free shipping."
337906,1,"These are my 4th pair of Converse, the shoes are comfortable, affordable and a classic! I already have them in black, navy blue and graffiti, so I decided to get a color more on the girly side so my friends stop saying ""are you into the emo thing now?"" , that didn't work, but I have a new pair of low tops that I totally adore!!The shipping with lasership was incredibly fast I ordered on sunday with Free Shipping and got them Wednesday!!"
233061,1,"Ordered these one half size larger (11EE, normally wear 10.5 wide), and they fit great. Comfortable right out of the box. I'm quite happy with these boots."
37100,1,"The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black. The Black and Navy are so similar in color, I really only needed to order the black. The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival."
66122,1,"Back in the day when FILA was being recognized by great tennis players and such, back in 88 this was the shoe have in Detroit. This is a great old skool shoe to have next to Jordan's. I am so happy to have found this old skool shoe to rock in the summer. When I was in 7th grade, students got there FILAS ""Checked In"" (robbed) because these shoes was so popualar and expessive at the time $120 or more! This shoe brings back memories. The all white with red/blue stripe and blue sole IS the classic FILA old skool style."
290530,1,"These shoes allow me to be comfortable while looking good as a medical professional. I appreciate the extra width, the sizing is accurate. I liked them so much, I ordered a second pair the day after I received my first. I'm very satisfied with the Prowalker by Rockport."
115391,1,"Cute, comfortable, and cheap! I love these shoes so much I bought two pairs (different colors of course) and I still want more!"
185878,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
271258,1,"Most comfortable pair of shoe that I own. Timberland always have quality products. I have tried other brands, nothing come close to this. You get what you pay for."
87862,1,"I ordered these ballet shoes 2 sizes bigger than needed based on all the reviews, and they were almost an inch too big, where they are suppose to fit like a sock..at least they will fit her in the future!"
306831,1,"This is an incredibly comfortable and stylish.the correct sizewonderful velvety nubuckI received many compliments and praiseI am glad to have these boots!They are worth every penny, I recommend to all"
196080,1,"I believe they are a very good pair of sandals, to me a little expensive but your feet worth it"
55911,1,Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months. the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores. We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
347052,1,"I walk about 45 minutes everyday and hate to have to break in shoes. I tried this pair on at the store and it was so much more comfortable than the others that I wanted to give it a try. It has never given me a problem--totally comfortable from the start, unlike better known brands that can take weeks to fully break. I have been walking in it for months now and it still has the fluffy, comfortable feel I felt the first day I put it on. My very favorite shoe--I have ordered 2 pairs to make sure I have back up when these go."
191854,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
163377,1,I appreciate the warmth and feeling of stability with these boots. They are roomy enough in the toes for extra socks.
11542,2,"Usually take a size 11, so ordered those, but they were strangely small.Don't understand all the raves here about this shoe!"
259405,1,"I got a pair for myself and absolutely loved them. They are comfortable and versatile. My husband liked them, too, and wanted a pair for himself. So now we have a pair of matching shoes that we each enjoy. They were delivered in a timely manner (both times)... I recommend these shoes and this seller."
197570,1,I wear a size 9 to 10 and these fit the best. I love how I was able to find the half size on here. A very sexy chuck. I wear to work and also out
281126,1,"I've had a cedar tree from Florsheim for a decade or longer. I've known how a tree will give shoes a longer life. I needed more trees, and got these Rochesters. They are very good, with a wider, rounder heel than most. They come in a nice (recycled) box with lots of helpful information on the back. The company seems to be in business with a passion for what they do, environmentally sensitive, not just knocking out product in plain cardboard boxes.Oddly, I found them at local high-end department store for 20% less than Amazon's price. But, Amazon's price seems competitive relative to what I've seen online."
216803,1,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
176996,1,"My husband is very happy with these shoes, comfort and value are important. Would get these shoes again and will recommend them to his co workers."
373609,1,"The shoe is very comfortable, but is small and tight in the toe. I would recommend ordering a size up from what you typically wear, especially if you want to wear socks inside the shoe."
162537,1,Amazon is a great way to buy. Quick and inexpensive shipping. Informative emails. Grandson loves them. Thanks
103335,1,I ordered these sock slippers for my 90 year old mother-in-law because she was complaining about her feet being cold. She loves them!
277987,0,"I have been wearing Hi-Tec Altitude hiking boots for more than a decade, and I am now on my fourth (and probably last) pair. There are several reasons that I like them: 1) they are comfortable from the beginning, at least for me, and and don't require ""breaking-in"" (blisters are rare even after hiking ten miles a day); 2)they are reasonably priced (but I almost always buy on them on sale); and 3) they are relatively waterproof (however this doesn't last too long, but can be restored by treating them with Sno-Seal or a similar product as needed.I started buying and using these boots after owning an expensive pair of Vasque hiking boots and replacing the soles on those twice. For a little more than the cost of getting the soles replaced on those I could buy a pair of Altitudes when they were on sale. I've worn out three pairs of Altitudes (each lasts about three or four years for me with moderate to heavy use).The biggest drawback about these boots (for me) is that the glue used to attach the rubber sole and sides to the leather is ineffective. The rubber/synthetic materials start separating from the leather not long after I start wearing the boots. For years my solution has been to reattach and somewhat seal the edges with copious amounts of Shoe Goo. It makes the boots look ugly, but it does the job for a year or two, and then I need to reapply the Shoe Goo in smaller amounts. I've been hoping that Hi-Tec would start using a superior system to attach the sole and sides to the leather, but this has never happened. At this point I've given up hope and will be trying out other brands. It is really a shame, because I do like these boots otherwise, but I am tired of the lame glue issue. If it weren't for that perpetual problem I'd be giving these boots five stars, but as it is they only get three."
97337,1,I love my New Mary Jane shoes. This is my 2nd pair of Propet Mary Jane's. I also have a pair of booths by Propet. I have problem's with my feet and this brand of shoes is the best so far that I have ever put on my feet.
169896,1,"I have wanted shoes like this since I was a little girl. And I was very pleased when I got them, I'm planning on wearing them for my wedding. They came in the mail faster than I expected, with in the week. There really comfortable and I can walk fine in them. Although I would prefer if they were a bit more rounded at the toes. I read other reviews, who suggest getting a half size larger. But I got my true size and they fit perfectley, I didn't have a problem with my toes being squished. But every one's feet are different, so I would suggest using your own disgreshion. I do however suggest having well pedicured feet, as every one can see your feet."
28555,0,"These shoes were a lot dressier than I thought they were, I wanted them for everyday shoes to wear with dressier jeans and slacks. These shoes are very shiny almost like tuxedo shoes but they look really nice and the price can't be beat."
72561,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
234254,1,"My favorite shoe's,I were sneakers all the time & these K-Swiss ST329 have been my go to for the last 3 years.Well made quality shoes leather/rubber soles (which don't make my toes warm/hot),i think these shoes are over all great for walking,running errands,everyday life."
384756,1,I love these flip flops! I am a lifeguard so I wear them everyday all day and they are great! Very comfortable and inexpensive. They dont do well wet however.
262895,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
292854,1,I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM.
16204,1,These are great looking summer sandals. Wore them to a wedding reception and received tons of compliments. Not for those who are new to wearing heels though - they are pretty high.
237051,1,"I took a gander at these shoes at a very low price of $20, worth every penny. Owned a pair of the blue stripe ones and they've lasted 2 years and still are comfortable to this day and sporty. I've gotten some nice compliments on them and it didn't cost me and arm and a leg."
187965,1,"The sneakers were very comfortable as soon as I put them on. I immediately went for a walk and they felt great. The velcro straps probably could be an eighth of an inch longer to allow for extra tightening, but the shoes looked smart and I received compliments. They seem to be well made and I would buy Propet sneakers again."
38964,1,"this is the only work/motorcycle shoe that i will wear 10 yrs. running now. comfortable, wears well,looks good,and now its even a better price. was paying 55 in stores got em for 35 here and they were deliverd 2nd day. awesome"
37542,1,"Very good ball control for an indoor soccer shoe. Looks attractive and easy to clean as well. The brown Sambas (retro) look better, but are not as wearable as this pair."
154397,0,"I have purchased many pairs of ECCOs over the years mostly with good results. I am a woman with bad,wide feet and I stand all day long as a painter. In the past I have purchased the ECCO Men's &#34;Cross&#34; style as a work shoe and found it met my comfort requirements: soft breathable leather, including a smooth leather insole, great arch support and flexible sole. Since that style is no longer available I took a chance on the &#34;Seawalker&#34;. Unfortunately, I have been trying to &#34;break-in&#34; this shoe for several weeks but still cannot wear them for more than an hour. The leather seems heavier and stiffer and the sole is not as flexible as the &#34;Cross&#34;, the stitching is higher on the foot and it is DEFINITELY cut more NARROW. It is still a well made shoe and if you have narrow, less sensitive feet, it could be a good choice.I may have waited too long to return these but I am still looking for a comfortable, supportive work shoe that fits me....will sell the &#34;Seawalkers&#34; to anyone interested."
383932,1,"I have lots and lots of problems wearing shoes. I find many women's shoes too constraining and tight, and have had various problems with my feet over the years that seem to just boggle the podiatrist. Putting me in orthotics seemed to make things much worse, as did just about any arch insert or other things inserted into the shoe. Most sneakers become almost unbearable to wear after several hours, and over time I've found that a light shoe with basic support worked best for me. I'd had good luck with some other easy spirit shoes so gave this one a try. And it is really amazing how comfortable this shoe is for me. It's so rare that a shoe fits and is comfortable without a serious break-in period, but this particular style just works that way for me, and I just hope they never discontinue it! I've tried a few other Easy Spirit shoes, even some walking shoes that look very similar but they just never seem to be as comfortable as this one. It definitely would not be the choice for someone who needs a lot of arch support and a really solid sidewall, but if you like very light shoes, this is an excellent one to try."
35539,1,Clark continues to enhance their shoes. Great color combo for summer.
368323,1,they seem to be well made and keep my feet feeling good all day - after hours of shopping and chasing kids!
161869,1,"EXCELLENT BUY. I'M ENJOYING MY SHOES AND I'M FEELING LIKE WILL SMITH, JE JEEEEE. I RECEIVED MY SHOES IN THE OFFICIAL CONVERSE BOX. THEY ARE ORIGINAL AND TOTALLY NEW."
74516,1,"Our toddler loves his crocs. He chooses them from his other shoes almost every time. I've heard there are some safety concerns with crocs, but he has never had any difficulty with them getting twisted or caught."
341218,1,"This is my favorite walking shoe. When one pair gets used enough so that it no longer provides good support, I get new ones."
179927,1,"No, I am not out on a cross country ""Walk for Peace"" but when I wear these shoes every step I take promotes World Peace. I have a red pair of peace shoes and I bought my mom a pair of pink ones. We love wearing them out together - we are a Mother/Daughter team making a double statement! Also, we get many comments - whether together or alone. People just love them! I wish I had these Peace shoes in 3 or 4 other colors."
115505,1,"These Saucony Jazz shoes are very comfortable. They are springy, padded and with just enough heel and arch support. You can rely on consistent fit and comfort in all colors. If they wear down, use gel inserts after months of walking/running. I paid $39 at another website after this purchase and free shipping both ways!"
22779,1,"Crocs are the best shoe for a backyard, water playing child. My daughter immediately put them on and went everywhere in them. When they get muddy or dirty I just wash and scrub off the dirt. I love that I have a shoe she can get muddy, but also still protects her feet."
251765,1,"Love the boots, fit perfect. Brand new in the box with all the paper and wrapping from the factory. Shipping was fast and the price was even better! Wear them all the time!"
357913,1,"they really fit good, are comfortable and nice and smooth for dancing.Glad that I made this purchase would do again"
169393,1,Great mocc - comfortable with rubber bottoms so fine for outdoors. definitely stretch with wear.
169932,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
134546,1,I have a really hard time finding shoes that feel good on my feet due to foot surgery. The Eastland Newport is the only shoe that I can wear for any length of time without my feet hurting. I would recommend this shoe highly.
144966,1,I Love my UGG'S!!! They are super comfy... I'd wear 'em to bed if I could!!! will for sure order more in near future... excellent shipping too!!! A+ :)
231932,0,"My son requires a wide cleat which is hard to find. I ordered the 3E Zephz Wide Track Men's listed in Amazon but I received a 2E. When I called Amazon they referred me to the seller, Fogdog. Fogdog told me that the widest they sell is an ""extra-wide"" which is a 2E, not 3E as listed on Amazon.Even for a 2E they are not very wide. But we will make them work by buying them a full-size larger than his feet, and stretching them a bit."
50090,1,"Good shoe, similar to Metrum, but more light-weight and narrower. The white color does show skuff marks after you use them for a while. But overall, an adequate replacement for my Metrum shoes, which seem ever increasingly hard to find these days..."
31364,1,"Looked all over for this one.My young friend had worn his Crocs right down to the ground.Amazon is always a first and often the last stop for me in most of the hardest to find cases. This is such a hard size to get, even from the Crocs store!Thanks, Amazon!"
103234,1,"These are a nice pair of leather ballet shoes. Although the size I ordered was still big for my daughter, even tho Ive read reviews to order one size up because they ran small. I found it to run almost true to size for my daughter."
164561,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
314139,1,The first time I purchase these boots was in 2002 for work. They are very durable and don't feel like mens boots. My daughter took my first pair so I had to order another. They will last a long time.
88648,1,"Got these for daughter to wear w/a black dress. She has wide feet, so hard to fit. The base/sole portion of the shoe was perfect (8.5 wide) but with the elastic upper she felt footing was insecure. Would have been perfect if we could combine the wide sole with the regular top. Not the shoes fault, she's picky & hard to fit. I may see if there is a pair in my size :-)"
388154,1,This is the second pair of Mary-Jane-style shoes I have bought from this manufacturer and I get compliments all the time...They wear beautifully and go with everything.
38572,1,"Great boots,waterproof,attractive,fit true to size,highly recommended. Looks identical to photo,genuine Timberland boots. Great on rainy days,clean up well. Identical to the man's version of this boot."
201895,1,"very fast shippping..so great i have this shoes for my 4 yrs old son...like the color and the shoes..wanna buy some more shoe like this sooner..great product..very comfortable to his feet,as if he dont want to take off the shoes..love it that much.................................happy shopping"
204922,2,"I bought this product after reading the reviews. Well maybe it works good for basic usage, but I work with landscaping and snow removal. This product will not dry your boots off in time to get to work after you have soaked them. I thought it worked great when I would get home from work and my boots would be dry but I was doing work on a pond and had to get in the pond, so my boats where soaked. I put my boots on it at 6pm and tried to put my boots back on at 6am the next morning and they were still wet. Really wet in the heal........Don't buy this product if you are depending on it....."
322653,1,"Always love this one better than other Capezio ballet slippers.The best part is it's true to the size. It's not necessary to buy half size bigger than your normal size as I always do when I buy other dance shoes, such as capezio-Julia."
99620,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
132873,1,"Several reviewers wrote that these boots are wide. I bought the wide width and I must say, they aren't that wide. I've worn them a few times and they've stretched some now so they're not too tight like they were at first. If you have large calves, you won't be able to tuck your jeans inside them. Like others have said, these boots are comfortable. I like that the heels are rubber and less likely to slip on hard floors like other boots do."
356794,2,I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart. To late too return them now so it was a waste of money. Very disappointed in the quality. I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality. Will not buy this brand again.
196474,1,I'm really happy with these Chucks. Seller sent them in perfect condition a couple days before expected. Good Price. Good Purchase. Good Day!
298098,1,Very comfortable shoes. They are a lot squarer at the toes than it looks like in the picture. But I like them because they are comfortable and I wear them when I am standing all day in a retail environment. I have had them for about 1 month. I cannot say how long they will last.
59357,0,"I'm on my third pair of these. I wore out the first two on my daily 3-mile walk. Now, one year into these, the left boot has started to crush my left big toe as it flexes when I walk. There is still plenty of sole left but I'm afraid I can't wear these again. I have really liked this particular boot for hiking and walks but I'm afraid I'm going to have to look for something else to replace it.2013-01-23: Update. I didn't wear these for a couple of weeks and then I tried them on a 3-mile walk tonight. They were JUST FINE. My left foot must have just been sensitive for some other reason which caused the problem described above. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again when these wear out."
59202,1,"If you are looking for good, comfortable and affordable hiking boots then these are a good choice. Durable and comfortable enough for long hiking on pretty much any terrain. Good ankle and arch support, and waterproof. I can't comment on how long they last as I haven't owned them long enough, but they are solidly constructed and I have owned Hi-Tec hiking boots in the past and never had any problems."
140933,1,"These are really cute and I got them to bring with me when I go out and want to switch from heels to more comfy footwear :).They offer no support and are a little flimsy, but will roll up so I can fit them in a small purse."
232561,1,"These shoes look a little more refined than the picture. They are very comfortable, sizing is correct, and they look great with khakis slacks or shorts. Very pleased with this purchase."
259478,1,"Bought these for working in a bar so I'd have a pair of shoes I could pretty much destroy and they've held up really well. The first few weeks were a little brutal though as it took my feet a while to adjust to the soles but, once they did, it was smooth sailing.Another thing, they're not as light colored as they are in the pictures here on Amazon. Mine were a few blue shades darker than the above pics."
135672,1,"As a farmer, practical rubber boots are a must. But,last week I was confined to a ankle brace for 8 weeks, which meant I had to find a boot that would fit over the brace and the shoe. A web search found the workbrute on Amazon.Your boot will serve the purpose perfectly. The future puppies and lambs thank you for your prompt delivery."
107179,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
187878,0,"These insoles are very warm, but they made my shoes too small. I think you would need to use them with a 1/2 size to 1 size up. I ended up taking them our of my boots."
386154,0,"I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
356406,1,"The slippers I purchased are very luxurious and attractive. They are nice and warm which is what I wanted, as I have poor circulation. They were moderately priced, and were delivered in a timely manner."
304771,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
382219,1,"I love these slippers. Had another pair and wore them out completely. They are warm, comfortable, and can act as shoes if necessary."
389051,0,"I find myself aquiring a third pair of 10 EE in a year. Up until now we have outgrown soccer shoes, but never worn them out. My 16 year old has hit six foot tall and has wide feet. The growing seems to have stopped and we should be having shoes last. Instead they are falling apart midseason and we limp along with them simply getting a new pair for the following season. For anything else I would not again repurchase something of such low quality. Unfortunately I cannot find any other soccer shoe that comes close to fitting. 9.5 EEE in a better made shoe would be ideal. (Insert Irish sigh here.)"
3146,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
143876,0,"I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
4675,1,"Very comfortable + durable. I wear flops in the office during the week, the beach on the w/e, and around town in between. So far no complaints with these guys.I'm a size 11.5...size 12 was the way to go."
69308,1,I had never heard of these shoes before but decided that since they came in a women's 10 1/2 I would give them a try. I was not able to find 10 1/2 or 11's at most stores and if I did get 10 1/2 the price was outrageous. They were listed at $89.99 on sale for $29.99. I received them this week and I have never had shoes that are so comfortable and light weight. I went out walking and didn't come home with my feet and legs aching. They have great support. I am going to order another pair. I have worn many different brands of walking shoes and these are the best.
76492,1,For the price these are great shoes. I do wear them with a liner because they are slightly uncomfortable without one. I plan to buy more in different colors. I like them much better than crocs. I am on my feet most of the day and when I come home my feet do not hurt.
58037,1,these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym. they are lightweight and very comfortable
16829,0,"I am sure they are great on real grass with the right size. One thing I noted is that they are bigger than what the guide says. I am a 10.5 regularly but they feel like a 11 or 11.5! In addition to that, I got the worse shin splints and hip pain playing on turf and sun backed grass! Unimaginable pain. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the playing surface.Conclusion: Get these one size smaller, and use them on firm natural grass fields."
351809,1,"I have worn the ASICS GT-21XX shoes for years now and the 2160 is the same old reliable shoe in this product line. I did have some problems with last years model (2150?) with both foot and knee soreness but not with the 2160, which is the whole reason I have stuck with this line for at least the last 7 years or so."
116813,1,"I just purchased my third pair of Bonnie Lites and own wine, black and taupe. I have knee problems and a hard insole really hurts my knees. The Bonnie Lites are well padded and like walking on pillows. Stylish and comfortable!"
292049,1,"My husband is 6'8"" and he loves these shoes. We have a hard time finding anything comfortable in his size that he likes. These seem to run true to size. They have plenty of room in the toe too. He has had these before and they seem to wear really well. Overall they are a quality product."
106864,1,Demasiado excelente diria yo. 100% original. 100% recomendado. Por eso le doy 5 estrellas y si se pudiera le diera 10 estrellas.
34213,1,"Don't know why Converse can't ship their high top sneakers with long enough laces, but the 63 inch laces are the perfect replacement pair. Also passed the teen boy standard as he said they were similar to the original's quality."
67428,1,Excellent quality boot with fast shipping. Will remember when I buy a new pair.
381927,0,"I really like the look of these shoes. Everyone who sees them thinks they are cute. The feel like flimsy flip-flops on, though. If you are not OK with essentially walking around barefoot (no support) don't get them. Also, if you break off one of the sequines, the rest start coming off since they are just threaded on one string. I covered the toes with clear nailpolish in the hopes that they would not unravel more and to stop the other one from starting. It seems to have worked so far."
302256,1,"I have every color known to man, and am always looking for more. I teach, so I am on my feet all day; I'm comfy and happy in my Converse All Stars! I must say that in my old age (40) I prefer the lo tops over the hi tops."
191978,1,"I have several pairs of Sanuk sandals but had not been able to find a pair in black. Great price on a great pair of sandals and received them within 3 days, love the fast shipping!!!"
337943,1,"This is my second pair of these shoes - I literally wore out the first pair. Very tall, very pointy. As far as size, I'm an 8 and they are just a tiny bit big - my heel slips a little when I walk, but I think a 7.5 would be too small."
163168,0,"Timeless look, whether you're a prep or a punk, anyone can pull off wearing a pair of chucks. Not good for athletic performance, it shocks me to realize they were created for basketball use. Ouch! Also, due to their lack of traction and feeble soles, it's easy to burn through a pair in a matter of months if they're your regular shoe. That makes them not worth the $40 price tag Converse is offering them for. If they were $20-25, maybe. I recommend this shoe for people more concerned with style than comfort."
278400,1,"These shoes are great. Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever had. These shoes make me want to stop wearing Vans because of how durable and comfortable they are. Style of the shoe is awesome. If you're looking for a shoe with a ""fat"" tongue then these are the shoes for you. Would definitely buy another pair or a pair just like them. You don't have to be a skateboarder to get these. I don't really trick skate anymore, but I've always been a fan of the Accel. The all black Accel is so cool and fashionable, which means they go with any style of clothing, any color, and so on. Umm, just all around great buy. FIT TRUE TO SIZE. Recommend getting them in your most common shoe size if you like them snug and want the shape to stay the same after months of wearing them. If don't care about the shape, then get a half size bigger. Either way the size will still be very comfortable."
52818,1,i am 15 years old and i have played soccer for at least 11 years.these are the best pair yet.this was the first time i ever had used kelme soccer cleats. i was very inpressed on how these babys worked.i decided to give them a try and they are very confortable on your feet since i have wider feet. i bought them last year from amazon and have used them in at least 4 or 5 seasons and have played in every game and every minute. they front spikes are very worn out since i used them so much and i finally started to feel the differnece in play. i have decided i am going ot buy a more expensive KELME pair since i am very satisfied with thise pair of kelme miura m cleats. i am 15 years old and these cleats are great.
328301,1,Had several pairs of these in the past and they were the most comfortable ever! So glad they're still available.
192427,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
127925,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
132438,0,"Again, the Dereon brand shoe seems to be very cheaply made. These shoes were comfortable, but they have a cheap feel to them."
78415,1,"Normal chucks...awesome as always. I've worn them for the past 2 years. They're looking a little worn now, time to buy another pair. :)"
158449,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
236136,1,"I don't normally buy shoes on-line; I have a wide foot and wasn't sure that the 9w would be wide enough. The pair I got fit perfectly, is an excellent buy, and was delivered in a matter of days. Very good looking and comfortable shoes."
33358,1,We had ordered crocs for years and wanted to try something different this year. My daughter loves these. She tells me they are extremely comfortable. I am so glad we tried something different this year!
118910,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
186430,1,Went camping on a sand bar and these boots went right to work. They fit well and do the job nicely. Wear some thick woll socks in winter as these are not the insulated version.
260064,1,Very well made boots. Nice and hard. Comfortable when standing most of the day. The leather is very thin and the boot feels very light.
87302,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
106614,0,"These were really point, the arch was awkward, I returned these. The heel was also wooden which I guess I overlooked in the picture."
65711,1,"I bought these shoes for Halloween to go with my Steve Zissou costume, and actually wear them all the time. They're so light and comfortable, I simply love them."
113011,1,This is a very confortable pair of shoes from the start. No break in period is required.
358288,1,Bought for husband. Keeps it hanging by back door. Makes putting on shoes a breeze. Should hold up for years. I have even gotten to like it.
174198,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
5471,1,I love my new running shoes! They provide all the support I need and for a decent price!
250782,1,"Love this shoe. I have a lot of problems buying shoes which is evidenced by the number of shoes in my closet that I can not wear. I was sure I was going to return this shoe as soon as I tried it on. Only Amazon's generous return policy convinced me to try it. The shoe has a solid comfortable heel base which takes the weight off the ball of the foot. There is a generous toe area which allows the toes to move. I have a lot of problems with my feet, a bunion and neuropathy. This shoe was so comfortable, I ordered a sandal in the same brand. I haven't received the sandal yet."
206347,0,"Beware if you're buying size 1 for kids. Instead of sending a Junior size 1 that should be listed as J1 (I called the crocs company), they sent a M1/W3, which is a men's 1/women's 3. It is incredibly wide and NOT the same thing as a kids 1. I was very careful not to select the M1/W3 choice and yet it switched and sent that.This is not a big kid size for a 7 year old...just for a very small adult."
366549,1,"I love these loafers, especially the Velcro closure. They are a great fit all the way around. The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because the upper is coming loose from the sole on the right shoe. Think I can fix it with some Superglue, but should not have to for an $80 shoe. This happened after one wearing, but have not had the problem on the black pair of the same style. Even with this small problem, I would buy these again."
360913,1,"My son called these my Ellen Degeneres Shoes. They are comfortable and practical. They go with a lot of my casual, khaki type pants. I think the style is more mature than some of the others. They have a more pointed toe, not so squared off. Good product for the money."
104598,1,"I have owned this pair for about 5 years, still going strong, still in a very good shape, wouldn't be surprised if they lasted another 5 years. After short break in period they are my go to sandals for the summer, very confortable, would recommend them."
132090,1,"This is an excellent boot and great for working outdoors. They are comfortable and sturdy, providing all the protection you need."
243844,1,Great pair of shoes with a lot of history. the only crappy thing is that i lost them... :Cthe shipping was quick and with a low price and yes... they were not avaliable for super saver shipping...Highly recommend them for everyone
113237,1,"I actually ordered the black suede/black leather shoes and received these by mistake. But they're so interesting and comfortable I decided to keep them. The suede is so soft it's almost like wearing slippers that conform perfectly to your feet. I don't usually like patent leather and that's what the toe portion of the shoes are made of but it's really attractive. I'd recommend these shoes to even the most conservative among us. Try it, I think you'll like them."
125527,1,"I bought these for my mother for her birthday, and she loves them. She's a bit of a slipper connoisseur, in that she wants her slippers warm, cushy, and well-fitting, but with the caveats that they don't make her feet sweat, that they're not so cushy that she feels like she's going to lose her balance like those cheap thick-foam-soled slippers do, and that they don't slide off her heel but aren't too tight either. She's a 7.5 and I bought her the size 8, which she says is perfect. The quality of the materials make them well worth the price."
9112,1,"The shoes arrived in a jiffy and were all that I'd hoped they would be ... a little wider than those of my youth (because that's the way I'd ordered them), still lightweight and comfortable, and with solid arch support. They're good walkers without being bulky. They're trim summer oxfords that don't overpower the look of an outfit. I got a stony-beach scuff on one toe, so I washed it. It washed and dried nicely, but the toe isn't pristine anymore, so, I guess I'll polish these sneaks just as I did in the '60s."
221108,1,These fit my daughter just fine (she is 18 and a size 11)She has been happy with them.
283898,1,"With no doubts claks has the most confortable shoe in the market, you only have to be careful with the shoe size."
210195,1,"these are some VERY awesome looking shoes. they sparkle and shine in all the right ways.the shoe itself is actually fairly comfortable. i'm not usually a huge fan of any height platform, but these seem negligable. to me it doesn't make the shoe any more or less comfortable. i DO like how the entire exterior of the shoe is covered with the glitter fabric. they catch the light something fierce!i am a true to size 8, which is what i ordered, and i found them to be slightly tight in the toe box area. i am sure after a night or so on the shoe stretcher they will be more than fine. the heel area feels a little loose, but some inserts in the back should take care of the issue.the only real beef i have with these is that the really fine particles of glitter DO come off on things (hands, clothes, etc.). i don't know how this will effect the appearance of the shoe over time, so i may try to locate a spray of some sort to ""seal"" in the glitter. i'm not sure why the shoes don't come that way anyway, but it's not that big of a deal, especially if i can remedy it myself.all in all, i found these true to size, reasonably comfortable, and really stunning shoes!"
165678,0,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
148890,0,"I'm sure this would be a fine shoe if it fit. Ordered a size 9w. It was a about a inch less in length than the size 9 I normally wear. Return was free, but I am disappointed that the size did not conform to what I thought was a standard."
299255,1,"Very quick shipment. Great product. I ordered the croc in Orange, but one looks sliightly more of a redesh orange."
386101,1,These shoes are really comfortable - so much so that I decided to stop wearing skateboard shoes altogether and just walk and skate in these.
283336,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
186705,1,"I have flexible flat feet and tend to pronate. While this shoe is not as good as Brooks Addiction, it is lighter and moves more easily. I only wish I had known it was available in narrow width. I expect that would have made it an even better fit and more help with my pronation problem. It does accept my custom orthotics. I ordered a pair for my mother as well as myself and she loves hers. She has serious mobility problems but these shoes in her narrow width and size 10 make walking much more stable and safe for her. We will certainly order them again. They look good too!"
170793,1,"Great for a Halloween costume, or for a goth, punk or black metal look (I will be adding some modifications to mine). They arrived quickly and they're exactly what I wanted. My normal shoe size is 8 or 8.5 (wide) and the size 9 fits perfectly. They aren't super high quality, but they are perfectly good quality for the price and look like they will last as long as any other $30-$40 pair of shoes. I am usually in between sizing for boots, being too big in the calves for regular boots but not big enough for many of the other plus-size boots out there, so I am very happy to have found a pair of boots that fits.The circumference at the top of the boot is described as 17.5"", and my bare calf is 17"". In a size 9, the boot is actually a little wider than this. I can't see myself ever needing to use the zipper to get in and out of them (and you will have to relace them every time anyway, since it's hooks all the way up, with the exception of eyelets on the foot and at the very top). While wearing them with heavy jeans underneath, and laced completely shut all the way up with no tongue showing, they measured 19"" around the top and 12"" around the ankle, and felt snug and comfortable on me while allowing enough room for motion. If you had to unlace the top as far as it would go without showing any skin in the gap, it will go to 21"". Even if you need it bigger than that, with skin showing, you definitely won't run out of laces; they are very long and I could wrap the extra around the top of the boot a couple of times with the boot laced completely shut. As far as foot size, the boot is 3.5"" across the widest part of the foot. Shoe length is hard to measure due to the shape, but my bare foot is 9.5"" long when flat on the floor, and the size 9 fits well with a comfortable amount of toe room.The sole is hard plastic with only a token amount of tread, so some caution might be needed on a hard floor if you're not accustomed to high heels. Not a major problem as the wide heel is very stable. I found them very easy to walk in, and if you're not on a slippery floor, they're as walkable as any other platform boot."
14843,1,I Got mine on clearence at Sports Authority for $75!!!!!!!!!! Feel like they were broke in out of the box. Really comfortable and lightweight
152442,1,I love these shoes. I cannot wait to take them on my cruise today because they are just so comfortable and cute to me. I have the Sanuk sandals so I wanted these and when I got them I knew I had made a great purchase
12440,0,"I carefully went over all the details before I ordered this pair of shoes. Hi tops - check. Size 7.5 - check. White - check. Chuck Taylor - check. Everything seemed excellent. That is, until I opened the box (which arrived just on schedule by the way). By some mistake I had received a pair of very nice looking low tops. Which would have been perfect if that was what I'd ordered. Now, the shoes have been sent back, and a new pair is on its way."
299688,1,"You really cant go wrong with Birkenstocks..they are the MOST comfortable shoe on this planet!! I wear these all the time! And, what a great price!!"
262265,1,"great shoes, available in wide width at a great price. Very comfortable, I have been walking on concrete floors 8 hours a day for 15 years, these shoes provide a great deal support and comfort"
178763,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
269318,1,"My husband will only wear this brand of shoes. THey are very comfortable, and it's great that they come in his shoe size and extra wide! This was the best price that i found online."
358570,1,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on character shoes since my daughter would only wear them for 2 nights. My daughter is sized for a 4 - 4 1/2, so based upon the other reviews, I ordered 3 pair (6, 6.5 & 7) to make sure at least 1 pair would fit. She ended up with a 6, so they do run 1 1/2 - 2 sizes small."
321741,1,"I enjoy these shoes, but have not figured out how to keep the laces tied. Also, I prefer to wear these for short outings and nothing that requires a lot of walking. I'm used to wearing well-supported hiking tennis shoes. I don't regret the purchase. I love the look."
283338,1,"Tengo estos zapatos desde hace mas de 4 a&ntilde;os; los compre originalmente para cross training, y termine utilizandolos para casi todo, son comodos y duraderos. Una recomendaci&oacute;n, verifiquen su talla en un vendedor local de Columbia."
181158,1,"Very simple, comfortable shoe- I get lots of compliments. The only negative is that it took a few weeks to wear in the shoe so that the back didn't rub a sore in my heel. A 1/2"" notch at the back would have fixed that problem, but I guess they didn't think of that. Also, I recommend going a half size or full size larger than normal because your toes are really cramped otherwise."
108079,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
92813,1,"These boots rock. They made the outfit. Good quality, nice looking. Definately need time to get use to walking in them, but other than that LOVED them. Highly recommend this seller fast transaction and shipment."
100069,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
304402,1,"I've been wearing adidas Samba shoes for about four years now. I love the fit and feel of them. They are durable and haven't ripped or broken in any way, they just get very dirty after a few years, which I'm pretty sure all shoes have that problem.I often wear the mainly black ones, but as I was searching for a new pair of shoes I saw this color pattern (mainly white, black stripes). It's also cool, but still simple. I have had this pair of shoes for almost six months and it still looks great.I will say that I have pretty flat feet and somewhat narrow feet, and these shoes fit me perfectly. I'm not sure if they would work well for someone with wider feet, but to anyone else I would reccomend them. They are cool, feel great, and are durable. Very happy with my purchase."
246568,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
333309,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
102394,1,"I usually get a 9.5W in sandals, but the footbed was too long in this shoe and the back straps were way too loose. I reordered in a 9W and they fit a lot better, not perfectly.. but they are really cute. I throught they were pretty comfortable until I could feel the side of the zipper on one shoe cutting into my big toe. Hopefully it won't happen again!"
54407,1,"Keds have always been good sneakers. These seem to have lived up to that. Since they are white, they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer, the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear."
149778,1,"The service was very good, the product arrived as request.The product was excellent, and was sent on the date specified, and their arrival was equally efficient."
77042,1,"I had these shoes for about 2 weeks now and they're great. Very comfortable, i especially like the cushion in the back of the shoe. I'd recommend these shoes to anyone who loves the game of basketball."
181364,1,"I've been a Top-Siders fan for years. The shoe does have an excellent grip on wet surfaces. The look is also great and they are comfortable. The price on this purchase came in less than other sites, arrived on time and in good condition. Overall, a great buying experience."
325062,1,One of the few soccer shoes still made in Germany. Leather is very soft and shoes don't need to be broken into. I've been using this shoe for many years now.
329492,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
387510,1,Great for the person that is on their feet for long hours. They may not be as nice as the Hi-Tec Magnum boots but they are close and about half the price. The best way to break them in is still to get them wet and wear them all day while hiking or just walking. By the end of the day the boots will be fitted to you feet and broken in to perfection. You may find youself wearing them more often then you thought you would.
243397,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
45064,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
174598,0,OK shoe but not as comfortable as other Clark models. Certainly well made but just not the right one for me.
64586,1,I ordered these in a wide width because the regular ones always seem to make my feet hurt. They are comfortable.
288659,1,I actually bought these shoes for my wedding so that my dress would just barely skim the floor. They worked perfectly and were pretty comfortable.
121917,1,"Wish all my boots were as warm and comfortable. Have lots that are not as comfortable, wear a lot of black so I wear them all the time this cold winter."
258455,1,"I brought this for a gift to my brother and he's very happy, his really a good shoes!!!"
247144,1,"I bought this shoe in August of last year. I have worn them for about 300 hours, most of that time spent standing and walking, and walked many miles in them in all weather and all kinds of pavement. I guess the wear I put on them might be a little above average. I love the fact that a $70 dollar pair of shoes is of such high quality, has a leather sole, and looks so good. My only complaint is that after a year of wear, the soles, especially the heels, are wearing very thin. The leather heel is very soft, and wears down to the wood very quickly, which looks a little ratty now. It's not too bad, and if I find a cobbler I'm sure I can get that taken care of, but it is an annoyance. I highly recommend these shoes, but don't expect the soles to last more than a few months of intense wear."
354986,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
206613,1,These shoes are very comfortable to wear if you are not really going to be walking around anywhere..Really cute for dinner or to go out somewhere where you will not have to walk very far. The scarf part is extremely comfortable but the bottom gets soreif you wear them for too long.
101274,1,"Ordered these flip flops for my husband and me. They were true to size and so comfortable! Living in Florida, we wear flip flops almost year long. We are sold on Crocs and own several pairs of different styles. These flip flops give very good arch support. So glad I found these!"
385885,0,"I gave these shoes three stars because they are comfortable and good for just walking around. However, I would not ever do anything that involves running or jumping in these shoes. The aharp edge on the bottoms make it difficult to land safely. I've sprained my ankles three times in these shoes playing volleyball (went up for spike, came down with the worst sprain I've ever had), basketball (sprained while trying to cut while running; foot sideways and my ankle gave), and once just walking (walking along a sidewalk, I stepped on a tiny pebble. my foot went sideways, and the edge of the bottom cause my ankle to go out instead of helping my foot go flat. minor roll, could've sprained). I'm prone to sprains, but I've never had this many issues with any shoe before. Here's hoping it doesn't happen to someone else, though I'm sure it has."
133666,0,"Nice shoe, but definitely not true to size. My daughter currently wears 8 (toddler) in &#34;regular&#34; shoes, so I ordered a size 9 thinking she would grow into them. Her toe is right on the edge, so she won't be wearing them long."
47563,1,I purchased my Croc clogs based upon the great reviews and I am so glad I did. They are very shock absorbent and cushy so they would be perfect for anyone with knee and or back trouble. I ordered my regular shoe size and they fit perfectly. I plan to purchase these again in the future when this pair wears out.
174610,1,"I've been wearing Clarks Natureveldt shoes for at least 7 years now and have gone through about 4 pairs during that time.Previous pairs had been made in Europe, however, the two pairs (one black and one brown leather) that I recently purchased were made in China. So far, the fit is the same between the Chinese manufactured shoes and the European made ones. There are however some design differences, of which the tongue is the most apparent as it appears to be made a little bit cheaper than previously. The laces also appear to be a bit cheaper.Should note though that overall the design/build of the shoe appears to be about the same or better in most areas. Time will tell however, as these shoes are pretty much legendary for lasting a long time.The main thing that I've always liked about these shoes is how comfortable they are even from the first wear. They do not require any break-in whatsoever due to the type of leather used, how they are constructed and how they fit on your foot.They just feel good on my feet. They are also pretty comfortable to walk in and since I have flat feet, this is a must have in a shoe for me.I personally like the style of the shoe, although some might find them to be a bit too classic, laid back or casual for a leather shoe.All in all, these are the only leather shoes that I really feel good about buying these days, however that might change if the move to China significantly decreases the useful life of the shoe."
332466,1,"The shoe looks just like the picture - very comfortable to wear and looked great out of the box.My only complaint is how quickly these shoes developed creases.i put the shoes on, took one or two steps and looked in the mirror to see how they looked with my pants. And there they were: 2 perfectly and quite deeply-made creases across the top of both shoes.. Permanent ones which erased that New-Shoe look in about 3 seconds of wear time. I found that to be a bit odd and annoying. But being that they were pretty inexpensive and not 100$-plus shoes i'm still pretty happy with the purchase. and the shipping was very fast."
62303,1,Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe..
237967,1,I bought this pair of converse for my daughter and she loves them. they are comfortable to wear and the quality is great
58296,0,"I purchased this tennis shoe for my 87 yr old mother as she wanted a pair like the ones Ked's made 25 years or more ago. The shoes arrived very fast in the mail to her, but the rubber sole much thicker, not like the ones originally made by Keds. Also, she is always a size 9.5 narrow, this is the size I ordered, but they were too short. If she kept them she would have had to have a size 10. Unfortunately, these shoes are made in China,so who knows what you are going to get. Why don't we have these shoes made in the USA where then the size would be correct?"
229611,0,"I bought these on amazon and for some reason they don't fit as well or are as supportive as an exact other pair i bought from a local adidas outlet store. Granted the other pair i own is a black pair, but that should have nothing to due with its comfort level. I couldn't walk in them for very long, i had to buy dr. scholl's insoles to make them livable. They look great but aren't comfortable."
56084,1,"Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit, color, style and comfort. Washable, and wearable right out of the box, I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult"

325836,1,Very satisfy by the product and I was impresed with how fast I got the order.I will order again from this place for sure.
144563,1,"I normally wear a 10.5 or 11, but based on reviews, bought these a little smaller in size 10. They are snug, but feel great, especially on bare feet. I do a lot of ballroom dancing and often have sore feet. After long dance practice sessions, these boots cradle my sore soles in luxuriously soft sheepskin. Sometimes, I even wear them in the house like slippers because they are so comfortable. You can look at the knock offs and imitations, but real Uggs are worth every penny. My recommendation is not to compromise."
254382,1,"This shoe is fabulous. Like a glove on your foot. True to size, I have worn them for three hours straight and felt no pain hiking through golf courses etc. They are the cutest womens golf shoe out there. I've seen FootJoy, Callaway, Addidas, etc and they do not compare to this cute shoe. My boyfriend even thought they were cute. I love the youthful look they have! Great the Teens and 20 somethings! I got cream colored and they go with any outfit. Pink looks cute, as does green, but I'd go with the cream if I were you."
5945,1,"i purchased the pink glitter heels. i was SO happy when i got them, they look really good and are VERY glittery!!! i got them for a halloween costume. i would recommend them for anyone that has pink in their costume. they are suprisingly comfortable and easy to walk in. WAY HOT!!!!!!!!!!!"
114618,1,"Nice ballet shoe for the price. My preschooler wears a 9 in street shoes and the 9.5 was best in this as it gave her a tiny bit of room. Technically they should fit the foot, but she liked it that way."
274728,1,"Great shoes, the same product as in the description. Few did not like the fact that the adhesive is already dirtied Nubuck Leather in some places. Otherwise, everything is fine. Recommend to anyone who likes sports shoes."
383938,1,"A long time Easy Spirit wearer, I'd been disappointed in the AP1s I ordered about a year ago; they had a sharp, toxic smell. Well, that's gone now. The shoes smell like good old leather, and they're softer than ever. Plus, the gray is true: not too brown, not too blue.I'm active, and have problem feet (sensitive heels, arthritis in the instep) so I need a shoe that not only fits like a glove without my having to crank down the laces, but gives me the support I need as well. Thanks Easy Spirit, for making the shoe I need!"
232463,1,This is a wonderful soft comfortable shoe that's perfect for every day wear but can take you into the evening as well. I bought two of the same in different colors. Highly recommend.
272230,1,"I recently retired my ASICS 1110s after racking up 300 miles. These shoes are by far the best value for runners!I used to wear Nike, but read in Runner's World Magazine that the ASICS 1100 was the Editor's Choice for best overall running shoe, so I thought, why not? In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar facitis (a.k.a. sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish.I now own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the 1100s - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two pair of running shoes except for the price.I ran about 15 - 20 miles per week in these shoes, enjoying superior comfort. If you run short or medium distances (&lt;25 miles per week), this is the shoe for you."
12971,1,Another great shoe from J.S Just remember they do run a little small. Oh and guys love them
361569,1,"This is the second pair of Aetrex walkers of this particular type I have purchased because they support my feet, never cramp them, are easy to put on and take off, the velcro straps stay in place all day and my feet do not hurt at night when I take them off. They are good appearance (black) and I wear them with formal business attire (suits) as a professional business man. I also have a more casual pair (white) for daily non-business wear. If you have foot problems - give them a try. I could not find any of my size in any store and had to estimate at the fit on the first pair (13-wide)and they fit perfectly. After 10 month's of daily use (10/hours/day/5-days a week) they show no noticeable wear. The nonskid soles are of great importance, although they do cause a squeak when wet(rainy days) and walking on marble corridors of some buildings. It goes away quickly as they dry. I highly recommend them."
261217,1,They are the shoe of shoes. I own multiple pair in different colors. They are great shoes and will last you... Be carful they can rub your skin raw if you don't properly tighten them.i could wear these shoes for days.
37410,1,Received product promptly.Item was brand new and i love it!
316940,1,"This is not my first pair of the M109 New Balance shoe. I usually have 2 at a time. One for tennis and one for walking. When the tennis pair begin to wear out, I buy a new pair for walking. I prefer its all-white look and the comfort is great."
278169,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
361848,1,Has worn Easy Spirit's shoes for years and loves them. Local store no longer handles and was very pleased to get this pair. Service by seller was superb.
299929,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
39186,1,"These were for my son who wears a size 15EEE shoe. These are perfect for him. He loves to walk, and now he can do it pain free."
115206,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
358427,1,I am very happy with the shoes! Great for dance lessons!Would certainly order them again and will recommend them to my friends.
194618,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
366798,2,"How can I order these sandals when you have the pulldown menu of sizes clothes sizes, not shoe sizes? You all don't have any easy way to let anyone know.I'd like to tell people about them but I'm not putting in a clothes size for my shoe size."
135370,1,I enjoy my purple chucks a lot. I get lots of comments on them when I where them. It is fun to see peoples reactions.
138943,1,"I really like Adidas and I have probably bought 20 pairs or more for me and my family on Amazon. Amazon has great prices on these and when they are on sale, well that's unbeatable!"
84588,1,"first of all, i am a big soccer fan and i have been playing the sport for more than 12 years, i play at least 3 times a week so i have tried aloooooooooooot of shoes,dont bother by the nike crab ( except for the talaria model for its light weight 7 lb ! ) ... this addidas shoe is really great, gives you great grib on the ball thanks to the leather exterior and curivng of the side. when you try it you might find it heavy so give it time (two games max) and you will see . great heel support and for the fashon lovers its nice looking."
31768,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
151672,1,"These slip-ons are just wonderful. The fit is perfect, and they do not slip off unless you want them to. I ordered two pairs because the price is right, and you can't beat Easy Spirit for a comfortable shoe. I am delighted that Amazon carries Easy Spirit! Thank you, Amazon....no need to leave the house to shop!"
385076,1,These Flip-Flops are awesome! they are very comfortable and great for tired feet. I use them as much as possible because I feel like getting a foot massage very time I walk. I recommend them to anybody.I think ordering a size larger wont be a bad idea.
304070,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
205471,1,"I've worn Fort Lewis boots in my home state of Alaska for five years. They have taken plenty of abuse, including two runs down the Chilkoot Trail. Not only are they still intact, but they are still waterproof - pretty astounding for leather boots. They require almost no breakin and are a whole lot lighter and more comfortable than my Wescos. But Danners run a bit narrow. Go for the D width if you normally wear a 'C' or 'B'. Otherwise, I suggest you might avoid having to hassle with returns by purchasing EE width. The Danner D is narrower than that of other shoe manufacturers."
251710,1,"These boots are sturdy, comfortable and stylish!I am a 7.5--my feet are average, neither narrow nor wide, and one foot is slightly larger than the other. The first time I tried on the boots (size 7.5), I felt as though the toes of my largest foot were being squished together. When I next wore the shoes and walked in them for an extended period of time, however, they were already broken in. Wonderful!Also, I have rather muscular calves, but fitting them into the boots was no problem. There was plenty of extra space for tucking in my jeans.I love these boots so much that I just bought another pair in a different color!"
130921,2,"This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned, and I would not recommend it to anyone. My left toes (all but the big toe) go numb every time I wear the shoe. Yes, I have the correct size of shoe; they're not too small. My toes don't feel cramped. It's just that for whatever reason, my left toes are always going numb. My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe (in the men's style obviously), and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb. My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk, not even walking. My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment, and his toes go numb while he's doing that. I've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood, and it happens every time. I am extremely frustrated because we're all stuck with these stupid shoes, which were expensive, because they've been worn a few times, and the store won't take them back now."
15044,0,"These boots are really nice, however, they tend to pull my long socks down around my ankles and start chafing my shins. I'm not sure if there is a way to get around this problem, but I've started wearing them with crew socks and it seems to help a little. I've thought about just tucking my pants leg into them, but it looks funny, since these boots are a little shorter than normal."
37385,1,"No idea why this shoe has stuck w/ me for so long...The design, the construction, the fact that it reminds me of days gone by? Who knows, but they have.I always mod these by puncturing the tongue about 1.5"" from the top to that I can shorted the height of it (so it doesn't hang out so far).Great shoe...you won't regret purchasing them"
115222,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
301288,1,"Buying shoes online can be tricky, but I couldn't resist buying these huaraches by Softspots, and I'm glad I took the chance. They are a well-made, comfortable and attractive shoe, and I've worn them non-stop since they arrived. The selection of colors is great, but when I was trying to choose a color, I saw some colors were already gone: a testament to how popular this shoe is. I chose brown, because it's a neutral color and will go well with anything I wear. I bought my regular shoe size, which fit very well. Overall, I am pleased with these shoes and will probably buy another pair in another color."
76604,1,"Exactly as represented! I've owned many pairs of Mephisto sandals, and I love them! They run true to size and are great if you are on your feet all day long. Very comfortable!"
184590,1,My 3 y/o loves these boots! He wants to wear them to school everyday! Will definitely cont. to buy Timberlands!
274292,1,My husband loves these shoes. We always buy more than one pair at a time so he always has a pair.
152448,1,This is my 2nd pair of Sanuk sandals/shoes and I love them!! Comfy and cool! Perfect fit from the 1st time I wore them!! I would reccomend them to anyone looking for comfort and style!!
254358,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
98621,1,I wear this shoe almost every day in the summer. They are so comfortable. I've even worn them in New York City while visiting there last summer. It's my favorite flip flop ever.
184681,1,I got these boots when i was working this summer in the woods not ideal for that but they are comfortable especially to wear if your standing on cement a lot.
134015,1,"I usually wear out shoes and boots quickly.6- MONTHSI also have trouble finding wide enough my size. 14 EEEE OR FI AM STILL WEARING THESE DAILY SINCE 2006THESE FELT LIKE OLD COMFORTABLE SHOES FROM DAY ONE.They were bought in Sept 2006 I still wear them daily. NO HOLES AS OF June 2012 and same soles aand heels holding up well!They still pass for dress boots if you give them a good hand KIWI Polish. Weatherproof time to time with silicone spray.GREAT BOOTS!...I AM BUYING ANOTHER PAIR TODAY.One bit of advice ....I do use a soft inner liner something like ....a DR. SCHOLL'S GEL, FOAM RUBBER OR FELT INNER SHOE PAD.ALSO helps if you are standing / walkingon concrete all day!"
112786,1,"We have been through many shoes thus far (I have an 18 month old) and these are by far the BEST for the buy. She has worn these cute mary janes solid for four months, and you would hardly know it! They wear well, with little markings to show for it! Plus, they are very cute, can go with anything, and are so easy to slip on and off my daughter's feet. She loves them!"
322575,1,Excellent leather slippers.From Amazon. Easy to wear and comfortable to dance in. You must try them. I gave them excellent reviews.
388084,1,"Bought these for my wife, and now it is all she wears. Well worth the price. Highly recommend."
99878,1,"Fits great, super soft and slouches a lot more than you would think. Very good boot and comfortable."
68008,1,I ordered these for my daughter for christmas she loved themshe has been wearing them everyday even when we have had 70 degree weatherthank you
260123,1,"Couldn't find the right size at the store so looked for it at Amazon, then found it and purchased here. Everything was perfect. My daughter loved this shoes, and delivery was done as expected."
65867,1,adidas adidas adidas siempre adidas .... son buenos zapatos para salir vestido a lo urban o a lo deportivo .
381538,1,"My daughter uses these for choral performances. Dancing is not her favorite thing but she tells me these are more comfortable to wear than the flat shoes she has. They look beautiful, in fact, I bought these shoes before to go with bridesmaid's dresses. They are dance shoes with leather soles so in order to wear them as regular shoes, some adjustments need to be made so they grip enough for everyday wear and to protect the more delicate heels. I have worn these shoes as dress shoes because they are comfortable. I would recommend them and I would purchase them again."
370229,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
195848,1,"First off, my order wasn't expected for 2 weeks. It came within the following week of me ordering them. I tried them on and it fit perfectly, and I didn't have to order a size up. My main thing was zipping the boot up over my calves and thighs since I have big legs. Thank God they stretch! it took a minute to zip up between my ankle and calf. Afterwards it was a breeze. Very Pleased."
88637,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
142990,0,They fit but I do not like the feel of the flip flop :( Ive been wanting to try these for years and feel let down
43734,1,"I am in the UK, buying long distance I thought maybe a problem, but not at all, very speedy delivery considering the distance. These are the best shoes I've ever worn, I have a long term back problem, and these shoes are just the right height, fit to compliment my back...From first wear they are comfortable, I am usually a UK 6.5 which usually is difficult to find the right EU size, but the EU39 fits perfectly, with my heel slipping gently in & out of this shoe as I walk, which is the correct way to wear these clogs...They are not the cheapest of clogs but you get what you pay for so worth every penny, I can't wait to save up for my next pair of these...WONDERFUL..."
225432,1,"I have bought these shows for maybe 40 years, I always loved them, and bought this pair for my daughter. She loves them, good to see a longlasting long loved product withstand the test of time."
297548,0,Please see my full review on the other location for this item. Fit great but sure didnt last as long as my old durashocks.
293220,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
300722,1,"My son like the boot, it fit well and is water proof. We received the boot just a few days after ordering it."
359413,1,"This year I bought 6 pairs of Crocks, love them all exeps this shining material of these Crocs Classic Clog,Cotton Candy,Women's. But I am happy because my gran child always ask me to wear these."
125029,1,"I own two pairs of the Softspots Tela, and wear one or the other to work practically every day of the summer. They're soft and cushiony. Could do with a bit more arch support, but I can live without that. Get this one instead of the enclosed huarache - it's not as padded. This one is great for wide widths!"
194964,0,"I used to wear this Newport style a lot several years ago. But had forgotten about them until I was searching for some comfortable shoes with support to wear during my third trimester of pregnancy. This pair ended up being too large (slipped in the heel), but I would have returned them even if they had fit because they are too clunky for my style now."
58055,1,"The shoes were great, but I have such a small feet they were too big. Sorry I had to return them."
241954,1,"Soft leather, quality buckle and taps and soft lining.4.5 fits just like a kids 2.5 sneaker.Daughter loves it!"
323154,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
231666,1,"I was in Italy last summer, and the first day out sightseeing, I hurt my foot so I couldn't wear my sneakers. The only other pairs of shoes I had were three pairs of these Tevas. I thought I was in trouble, climbing all over ancient Rome in flip flops, but they were fabulous! Because they stay on so well and are so well cushioned, they turned out to be the perfect footwear.I told my niece to get them for her trip, which she did, and she loved them too."
23877,1,"Had a pair just like these that lasted about 5 yrs. they didn't really wear out, I just noticed they started to stink...so I bought a new pair. Here's to another 5 years!"
386890,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
288294,1,"These are great sandals! I bought some last summer and haven't been able to locate them locally, but fortunately they were available on the Internet. Love them! One of the most comfortable sandals I have found."
222282,1,I love these little boots. They are true to size. So comfortable and cute. Will be wearing them a lot this fall.
118682,0,"I purchased these for my grand daughter when she starts ballet classes. While they arrived quickly (Prime), I was disappointed to see that they JUST fit her even though we ordered them a size bigger and extra wide. I guess the Chinese have smaller feet?? Yes, I pick on the Chinese,,,,,, for good reason.Anyway, the shoes are really cute and are functional so I can't complain about that. She looks good in them."
105351,1,"I love the first pair of these boots so much that I bought a second when they started looking too well-worn. Now I have an everyday pair and a dress pair. The color is accurately depicted and the fit is fantastic. The heel height is just right for lil' ol' 5'2"" me. With the great red color and height, I feel powerful!Love, Love, LOVE!!!"
104582,1,"These boots are for my grandson who is really into pirates.Thay are not leather,but look well made and are washable with damp cloth,so he will be excited to receive these for Christmas!"
271633,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
59325,1,"This is my third pair. The first finally wore out after 5 years of use in the yard and all around durring the winter and my second is reserved for just hiking, (they took me over the Indian Himilayas very nicely, thank you.)Light weight, inexpensive, and a good fit. I can recomend them. Oh Yea they truly are water proof till about 5 years old."
307724,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
267206,1,"Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints."
126784,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
346132,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
111026,1,Pros:Great Ankle supportEasy to stand in.provides great traction over rough terrain.Water proofCons:Moderately HeavyNotes:Do not try sprinting in these.
250295,1,"I received my shoes today and they are great. Not only do they look good, but they are very comfortable. I ordered a 9.5, which is what I always wear in this brand and they fit perfectly."
10858,1,"I've worn Island Pro Sandals by Island Slipper, Hawaii exclusively for over 6 years. They are the most comfortable, durable and good looking sandal you can buy! They form to your feet and keep you warm in Winter. I wear them to the beach, park, mountains and street. My current pair are 2 years old and show no wear! They are practically indestructible. I've tried all the other brands and there's no comparison. Island Slipper Flip Flops are light years ahead of the rest. Wear the best, forget the rest!"
362377,1,"Highly recommended. Well made, quality materials. My last pair served me well for more than 5 years of regular use."
197420,1,Fast shipping. Thank You!! I bought these for my son. I may buy a 2nd pair. He normally wears a size 14 but in these I bought a 13 and they fit fine. He loves them.
40382,1,"Love these shoes, these are the 3rd pair I've bought b/c I wear them ALL THE TIME!! Great shoes, so comfortable, versatile!! You will want to live in them ALL summer!"
180309,1,"hella cool chucks..theyre not cheap, good quality..i was satisfied and so would you be...one minor problem is that purple passion (which is the one i ordered) wasnt the exact color as the one shown...but its still cool!! i love them"
226099,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
237130,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
338046,1,When I got the chucks I started to train capoeira and I felt like I was stylin and profilin wwwooooo
25648,0,Fast delivery - but my wife says the shoes are very poor quality.Worn once and tossed into the trash.Not the seller's fault however - so 5 stars to them and 1 to the mfg. thus 3 stars.
233244,1,"Now I don't normally wear western type boots so maybe there is a rule on how to size them. I wear a 9.5 shoe but I could not get my foot inside a pair of 9.5 boots. I'm returning the boot and I will go to a boot store to get sized and try some on before I order online again. Again, nothing wrong with the boot itself...just sizing issues for me."
157682,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
56526,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
387772,1,These are comfortable and easy to slip on. These will also be good for surgery
152742,1,"This boot is amazing! It is comfortable, soft & runs a size big, so I ordered a size smaller. I ordered it and it came 4 days before expected! My daughter was so excited! Now I can't stop looking for more things to buy from here!...lol"
268545,1,"I bought these as a gift for my teenage daughter and she loves them. They are well-made, have a sole you can wear outside and the light colored ""ruff"" of sheepskin is a very cute feature. They're the kind of slipper that will just get better the more they are worn."
337659,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
372870,1,I enjoy my purple chucks a lot. I get lots of comments on them when I where them. It is fun to see peoples reactions.
358374,0,"I ordered up a size from normal, but the shoe was still very tight. I sent it back and ordered a size up- wide. They have not yet arrived.Shoe looks well made, but since they were so tight, I never tried them for dancing."
24218,1,These boots are great quality for a low price. I couldn't find knee-high lace-up combat boots that looked decent for under $70 until I found these. Great product and really comfortable as well.
285120,1,"The service was super quick and the price was better than other websites for the same item. One note of caution, if you are short like me then these boots are more than ""thigh high."""
119765,1,"Quick shipping, and no problems at all. They have all the colors so you can mix and match"
233562,1,Excellent quality. I just wish the whole shoe was patent instead of top and heel.
313910,1,"I purchased these boots about 2 years ago, they are the best. Waterproof, comfortable and warm. I wear these to work all day and dont want to take them off at night!! Love these boots."
15730,1,"I've been looking for a great looking shoe that my toddler can't take off. These are perfect. Since they're high tops, I lace them up all the way, double knot them, and I don't have to worry about him losing a shoe in the store. The only problem with Chuck Taylors are that they're somewhat difficult to put on my son's wide feet. I can tell that they're fine and comfortable once I put them on him, but I have to spend a lot of time loosening up and re-tightening the laces. I did go a size larger than my son's normal shoe size because his feet are kind of wide, and they fit perfectly. Really, you can't go wrong with Chucks."
387171,1,Very comfortable shoes! Warm and cozy. After a long day of work there's nothing like slipping these on.
160971,1,"great sneakers! look great and fit perfectly. can wear with anything!the best for skydiving :)will definitely buy again, maybe different colors.thank you."
219345,1,I need to change shoe size from 6N to 6M. You have no place to make a change. Other than that I like the on line ordering.George
153310,1,"I love these Easy Spirit Traveltime Mules. I can wear these all day long without any discomfort, especially shopping. I have bunions so these mules were so easy on my feet. The color of black was perfect to wear with the black shorts and slacks I have since not all blacks are equal. I will buy another pair in a different color."
18825,1,"very fast delivery,nice construction, duriable sole , nice sizing,very happy with my oder"
85700,1,I bought my second pair of crocs and continue to love them. I had my mother in law try them on - and ordered her a pair as well. My mother in law has feet problems and she loves her blue crocs and wears them everywhere.
46752,1,"These are cute shoes but if your kid usually uses size W shoes, you need to order XW because these shoes are a little tight in front for kids with fat feet like mine."
136033,1,"I have always loved chucks, they are a classic. If you need more support in the arch, you can always add an arch support or insert. For me, they run true to size. A half size smaller is to narrow, since they run narrow in the toe anyway. I have wide feet, so if your feet are narrow, maybe this would not apply to you."
332015,1,I have several pairs of these Croc's. Very comfortable but the colors look a little on the childish side...and the black tends to pick up all the dust in the world --- making them look dirty. I bought the Khaki this time. WOW...what a nice color. Not too greenish and not too brownish. Just a nice in between color that goes well with a lot of clothes and seasons.
292616,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
325912,0,"Shoes are cute and a good deal. Not the most comfortable, but fits my needs for walking around or shopping."
131750,1,"Fantastic. Paid for shipping, yet I received it in a total of two days. Ordered it at 9 in the morning on a tuesday, received it wednesday evening. How awsome is that. 5 out of 5"
90932,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
244127,1,"Cute casual shoe. I purchased the black leather. The shoes are very comfortable and light on the foot. The shoe could have been a little tighter around the heel, but overall I am pleased."
378390,1,"I'm so Happy with this purchase, received it just in time for the show! Shoes were a hit, great choice!"
99793,1,"I have had plantar fasciitis for over a year. I have tried several different shoes that were advertised as good shoes to wear for this condition. Some have helped a bit but my feet still hurt whenever I got up from sitting down for awhile. I have been wearing these clogs for a few days and my feet do not hurt anymore. I believe it is due to the extra high arch. They are very comfortable and I plan on wearing them as much as possible. If your feet hurt, give them a try."
288983,1,This is the original! (Rubber soles) Rockport changed the production to a injection moulded model now in stores which is inferior to the original.Thanks Amazon. This is a great walking shoe.
3450,1,"This is my second pair, the first are wearing like iron and I wanted to make sure I could replace them."
282084,0,"Based on previous reviews about these running big, I ordered my 'normal' size 11 knowing a bit big is far better than a bit small. When the shoes arrived, they were very snug. I had to return and order a half size larger. (good thing Amazon's ordering/return system works so well) Receive the 'right' size as promised. The shoes are pretty comfortable but do have a few quirks. First off, there is a slight pinch on the top of the big toe where the leather bends while walking. Secondly, there is a decided 'pop' in the leather with each step, again in the toe area as the leather bends then relaxes with each step. I'm hopeful that once worn a bit, both issues will remedy themselves. The shoes are very nice looking and I've had several compliments on them already. The toe pinch does seem to be going away and I hope the popping sound does as well. The shoes appear to be very well made. They are not light as the sole seems to be very durable. All in all, I'm glad I ordered them as I expect them to be great shoes. Just not the slipper feel I'd hoped for, but are very comfortable none the less."
132052,1,"I have gone through 3 pairs of shoes before settling on these and they are wonderful. I have REALLY bad arthritic knees which makes it difficult to walk around for any length of time without pain, but wearing these Softwalk Mariposa's makes for much less pain and I'm able to walk around for a much longer time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
234070,1,"I recently ordered my third pair of these K-Swiss and right away noticed a change in comfort over the previous two pairs that I still have to directly compare with. I also noticed the new pair are now made in Indonesia where as my previous two pairs where made in Thailand.There is a VERY noticeable decrease in the padding around the ankle sides, so much so that the new pair fit looser around the ankle area than both of the old pairs. I really do not like how lose they fit now nor the feeling of my foot coming out the back of the shoe.Bottom padding does feel like a new shoe should but overall they just do not have that amazingly comfortable new shoe feeling like my second pair had when they replaced my first pair. I remember how amazing the second pair felt when they were new compared to the ones they where replacing. This time I had to put the old one on one foot and the new one on the the other to feel a difference.I am on my feet in my restaurant for 12-13 hours a day and I wore my first pair for about 6 months and my second pair about 4 months. These I may use only as long as it takes to find a pair that are made in Thailand or another brand all together.Even with the decrease in comfort they are a decent value. In my opinion though they went from a good deal for comfortable shoes at $60 to just an average $60 pair of shoes. I would rather go back to spending $80-$100 for a comfortable pair of shoes that last the same amount of time."
306789,1,These shoes are quite the top of the line. I have a very small foot and cannot always find shoes for men. So...I buy women's sizes and they fit swell. The Skecher runing shoe is a great fit and it is made well. It looks strong and durable. You won't be sorry if you buy these...men you will not look sissy!
260545,1,"It's perfect for my two and half year old daughter. Comfortable, durable and easy to clean. The only concern I have is that she may twist her ankle in these shoes, but it hasn't happened yet."
31649,1,"There very comfortable, slip on easaly. I don't know how durable they will be, but if their like other Ecco shoes I won't be disapointed."
94796,0,But the size is very small for the normal we find in other modelsMy 11 received is like 10.
72696,1,"The most comfortable and durable walking shoes I've found, especially great for travelling as they don't mark you immediately as a tourist (unlike sneakers), slip on and off easily when going through security, and look good in all but dressy situations. I only ever need to buy a new pair every year or two because I wear out the support in them for lengthy walking. I still have my original two pair for use around the house or on weekend errands. While not waterproof, the shoes seem to be water resistant, the sole thick enough to keep the cold of the pavement from coming through, and a decent enough grip to walk in all but the iciest conditions. I hope Eastland never stops making these shoes!"
201510,0,"Came in a timely manner, correct style and size but the color looked different online. Still happy with the color. Very happy with the quality and price!"
82076,1,"I love these shoes because the medium runs on the narrow side. They do come in narrow, but not always easy to find in popular size 7. They are classic, tailored, like much of my wardrobe, so I own them in every color and color combination. They also wear well. Excellent quality at a good price. When I'm really lucky, I find them on sale."
121044,1,I bought these as a gift . The child loves these shoes! Her mum loves the fit and comfort as well as the style. Good price on Friday sale... fast service.
374597,1,These are a nice pair of casual work shoes. Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks. They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer.
47240,1,"First, I'll start by saying I love Chacos. I got my first pair in the spring of 2003; (I wear sandals year round, I'm not a closed-toe shoe person)I finally wore them out in late August of 2007 when one of them snapped in half from being worn so thin. That was 4 years of year round wear. I did everything from hike( all seasons & conditions), horseback ride, to just hanging around in them. They are my every-day shoes. I was an avid Birkenstock wearer( and I still LOVE them), but Chacos do better in my acyive lifestyle. I just recently purchased my 2nd pair, same style as before, and when these wear out in 4 years I'll be buying another pair just like them."
288990,1,very comfortable. i am very pleased with these shoes. i have bones spurs that are quite painful and the shoes work wonders to help relieve the pain
111388,1,This is my 3rd pair in 24 years. That's a fine testimony to their durability. Matterhorn makes great boots IMHO.
163596,1,"have been wearing this shoe most of the day, almost every day forever. It is very long wearing and super comfortable. Hope Easy Spirit NEVER stops making this particular sneaker."
9596,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
246098,0,"The shoe pictured is what I was expecting, but the shoe received has a shorter, flatter heel; I'll keep it, but really prefer the 1-1/4&#34; heel depicted.."
50193,1,Everyone rants and raves when they see these boots and are totally astonished at the price as was I!
235707,0,"The color did not go with the outfits & the fit was not narrow enough. I really wanted just the camel color without the croc look, made the shoes look cheap. Sent them back, will try again. The seller was excellent, will buy from again."
175569,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
343359,1,"This is the second pair of these I have purchased. It is a neat looking and very comfortable choice. It is a great shoe if you are on your feet a lot. Purchased my first pair at a retail store, and, when I found them so favorable, I immediately looked for them on Amazon."
70505,1,I had earlier purchased these shoes in another color and really liked the fit and comfort. No bulging at the sides and they look really expensive! Will probably purchase the same shoe in yet another color. They fit true to size.
162431,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
256878,2,"These boots run HUGE. If you want them to fit,buy a half size smaller than you usually wear. Also, the bottom of the boots are extremely slippery!"
294338,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
15140,1,"This is my second pair of Earth Lazers. They are wonderful walking shoes. I use them for work and exercise. Very comfortable, lightweight and flexible. I wore them on a trip to Europe and my feet never hurt after doing much walking."
38557,1,I love these boots they are perfect for my six year old. They are durable and I love the darker color so the dirt does not show as much. The price was great and shipping was fast
84369,1,The shoes're great. I love them. They're very light&comfortable and easy to wear. They're perfect for the summer and can go well with the jeans & short.
248460,1,I have a 3 year old who is hard on shoes. These are good inexpensive boots that last a while . Its definitely worth the money
104167,0,"I love these Eastland shoes but can't seem to find them anymore. I was excited to see them on Amazon as my old pair is looking quite worn. When I got them, they were too small! I guess I learned my lesson and won't purchase shoes online again. I just did my first ever return to Amazon and will see how that goes. By the way, I have worn the same size shoes for years!"
223855,1,"The order was a birthday gift for a granddaughter. It arrived promptly at her house and upon opening the gift on her special day, she informed me that she LOVED them. Service was great."
369955,1,"I saw these in a J. Crew store and of course, they are cheaper on Amazon. They are exactly what I saw! I've washed them a few times and they held up. The canvas stains particularly easily so they didn't stay nice and white for long, even with the washing."
69367,1,These are comfortable and easy to slip on. These will also be good for surgery
203552,1,"I've gone through 3 pairs of these bad boys and each pair has been more then worth the money. I'm a big guy (6'4"" 195lbs) and even with running about 25 miles a week these shoes will easily last me 5 or 6 months. Even then I just replace them to refresh the cushion. The shoe itself stays in good shape, no holes in the heels, no worn out tread.This shoe offers my big foot just the right amount of ankle support and you can definitely feel the cushion. They also breath very well and keep my foot relatively dry. As a bonus these shoes dry quickly if you happen to get caught in the rain.After the shoes get retired from running I use them as everyday shoes until my next pair of running shoes gets replaced. After that, they get donated.I'm getting ready to buy a new pair and once again I'm going to be getting a pair of these."
74478,1,"I bought 2 pairs of these crocs for my twin boys and they love them!! They like to put them on and run around the house and they are so easy to clean, just wipe off with a damp cloth. The sizes do run big!!"
84945,1,"It was well past time to replace my set of H2 sandals. Quick search, quick order, and quick delivery were the hallmarks of dealing with this vendor. As a bonus, the company reused an old KEEN box for packaging. While the box was gently used, the sandals were pristime - which is just fine with me. There's no need to stand on cememony with a sparkling box: just get me the sandals I need at an affordable price and on time. That's just what they did."
218054,1,Customer Service was quick to reply as well as very helpful. The item arrived fast and in perfect condition. Excellent service.
207810,1,"I love the shoes, the shipping time was really fast, the price was better than I found anywhere else. Great product!"
146893,1,I LOVE THESE BOOTS! THEY'RE WARM AND SOOOO COMFORTABLE THAT I NEVER WANT TO TAKE THEM OFF - MY DAUGHTER HAS HAD HERS FOR 6 YEARS AND THEY'RE STILL LIKE NEW!
117263,1,These shoes are very comfortable. Wear with thin socks to prevent them from stretching. Only negative thing is that they scratch easily
245810,1,"These boots were given to my husband as a replacement of something similliar but the heels have held up so much better on these boots. He was happy with the fit, not too tight, and how well they hold up in all kinds of weather. The color and leather still look great."
107123,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
115916,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
142126,1,I really like the Keds sneakers.. I ordered Navy and they look black. I would order again but in another color.
201593,1,"These shoes are awesome, my girlfriend loves them and they are very classy, definitely buying another pair after these!"
201909,1,My 3 y/o loves these boots! He wants to wear them to school everyday! Will definitely cont. to buy Timberlands!
360814,0,"I normally wear an 8.5 (wide, if they have it) so I ordered these shoes a 1/2 size up (and wide) from other reviews suggestions. Welp...it still wasn't enough. These shoes definitely run small, and with hindsight I would have ordered a 9.5. Because it's too small, and because I'm too cheap to send them back, I will wear them anyway and just suffer a little bit from the pinching on the top side of my foot and toe box area. They are very cute though, and the heel is low enough to walk a moderate distance, but tall enough to add a little length to the legs. I took a risk by buying shoes I had never tried on before online, and it was almost a good idea."
359265,1,I bought the shoes for my son. He likes it very much. Your Amazon services are excellent.
197019,0,"great craftsmanship, but sized smaller than previous purchase. I should have ordered a size larger, but went by last purchase of a similar item."
140304,1,Easy Spirit tennis shoes are the best for my feet that I have found. They have good cushioning and arch support. These are relatively inexpensive as far as Easy Spirit's go. I am very happy with my new shoes so far. They have met the Easy Spirit threshold as I expected.
284525,1,"I was so very glad to find these shoes! I was a bit worried at first-it had been so long since I had a brand new pair of slip on shoes! The reason for that is because Eastlands are so good, I can wear a pair for 10+ years! I have a pair of brown similar ones that I've worn for about that long-maybe longer. But they last forever and are the only brand I will buy. I'm still wearing the brown ones, but wanted a pair of black ones to match my purse and coat for winter. They felt a bit tight at first, but it's been so long since I've had to break in a pair of shoes since Eastlands last so long! Wore them a couple of nights at home, broke in perfectly, now they're my new favorites! I've tried others, but Eastlands are still the best:)"
175183,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for YEARS! My sisters tease me about my ""ugly"" shoes but they're so comfortable that I don't care-let them tease! I wear these in both black and brown and they're actually the only shoe I wear. I am a postal employee with a walking city route and walk about 12 miles each day and these are the shoes I wear. I love them! The leather relaxes fairly quick but does not really stretch out. After about 6 months of everyday walk and wear the bottom cracks but that's to be expected, I'm HARD on these shoes and they're still sooo comfortable!"
362914,1,The shoes are very comfortable and the delivery was fast and well packaged.I'm happy with my purchase through Amazon
2958,0,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
99694,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
58654,1,a lot longer than i thought they would be. but a nine would be to small. but they are nice. just wish they weren't so long.
185091,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
87488,1,"Comfortable beyond my expectations. I usually wear a 12, but I had to return the 12s and re-order 13, which are exceptional in comfort and appearance. I will buy another pair in the near future."
188145,1,"quality is very good. Be sure to order 1 size bigger than your normal size. I am normally 8, and 9 is perfect for me"
271514,1,"I was looking for an Easter Gift for the boys since 2 of the 3 have Sugar diabetes, So i found these Converse Men's Team Respect style sneakers. So i bought them for 19.99 and the value was 79.99.Boys were happy and so was I.Great quality also."
304242,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
363793,1,"the shoes were awesome quality, shipped very quickly, but i guess that style runs big, i usually wear an 11, ordered that. they were huge, had to send them back."
250133,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
208588,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
319536,1,I just purchased a pair of these shoes to replace some exactly like them that I have worn every day since 1994!! Those have reached the point where the heels are so run down that they make me walk a bit crooked and one sole is nearly worn through. But can you believe that kind of service from a pair of shoes? They are so comfortable from the first day of wearing and like a well known bunny the just keep going and going. I can't reccommend highly enough.
388127,1,"I absolutely love these shoes! They are cute, comfortable & match so many different outfits! They were also very reasonably priced. The only problem I found was upon arrival, the shoes had a couple little scuffs on them. Nothing huge, but they were there.Other than that, they are fabulous!"
95465,1,"my husband and i are managing a cow/calf herd which we began in 1995 and found our feet, wearing rubber boots most of the time, were in need of major support. These Birkenstock are not only good looking but have solved some feet issues for us as a bonus. these sandals are unsurpassed in support, looks and price. we own a pair for the farm (warm weather) and another pair for going public. thanks"
197179,1,I had a similar pair of Reeboks and couldn't find another pair so I decided to try these. Well they arrived and I loved them instantly. Everyone that sees them asks about them. They are really neat shoes. Don't hesitate to get a pair while you still can. They are comfortable and really in style!
168296,0,"It's a great shoe with a great design. Feels comfortable over all, however the front of the shoe rubs on the top of my big toe and has caused a blister of sorts. I believe this is due to the design of the shoe being somewhat restricted in the front with little room for my toes to feel comfortable which ends up with the top of the shoe rubbing on it constantly after a long days work. This causes mild comfort issues and if I could return it I would (problem came about after 4-5 day usage)."
66069,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
199198,0,"This was the first time I had bought shoes online, and even though I own a old pair of these Timberland shoes, and ordered the same size, they were a poor fit. So I sent them back, and paid for the postage. Not sure I'll buy shoes online in the future."
348796,1,My husband has a pair of these shoes in brown and wanted another pair in black. I ordered them through a catalogue companyand was informed after months of waiting that the shoes were not yet available. So I surfed the web until I finally found theshoes available via Amazon through Shoe Mall. It is very difficult to get shoes that fit and the Ultra-Walker Men's Quick GripWalking Casuals have proven to be excellent. My husband always had problems getting comfortable shoes and afterhe was diagnosed with PD which created difficulty in walking we found these sturdy well made shoes which are goodlooking to boot. (No pun intended). Thanks to Amazon's prompt service he finally has his much needed shoes.
86215,1,I work physically hard and spend most of my 50 hours a week on my feet. I find that dansko's give me the support so that my legs and feet are not exhausted. Which allows me to run 25 miles a week. Being over 50 says something for the great design in the dansko shoes.alwaysjoyfulAJ
98102,0,"These shoes were so highly reviewed that I got them, but to be honest they are no more comfortable than any other work shoe I have ever had, maybe even less so for a nurse shoe. They seem sturdy though, so I am hoping the fact that they are average in comfort will not matter because they last a really long time. Fingers crossed."
89512,1,"This is my first MBT shoe purchase. This sandal is comfortable, adjustable, and well-made. I bought an MBT because of back problems. I am not sure if the shoe is helping or not."
284943,1,"From my eight year old son: These shoes are very very soft, they make a great noise. They were a great value."
228893,1,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat.I received 2 pairs of nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat White.when requesting the colour on the order form, you have 2 options for wheat. The option for Wheat White is not separate from regular wheat.I am now stuck with 2 pairs of the wrong colour. I live in Ireland and therefore would be very expensive for me to send them back to you.I am very dissapointed with my purchases. Unless you can rectify the situation for me I will not be recommending your service to family and friends.Thanking youRachel Costello"
84175,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
278706,1,"Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!"
133441,1,"I have a lot of shoes (I've been accused of being the Imelda Marcos of men, but this is a winner. Comfortable, and it can be casual or dressy. It started me on the Neil M kick!"
364761,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
25886,1,My husband has been wearing this exact shoe for years...we are sad that it appears to be discontinued and that finding a suitable replacement in his size ( 15 US ) is nearly impossible!For NB 991 lovers...get 'em while you still can! Reviews we've read on the replacement aren't very good!
382336,1,This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors. Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great. You can't go wrong with this shoe.
85385,1,"As a daily runner and marathoner, I was in the market for a new pair of running shoes. I considered the Nike Shox, but after a few tries with them I decided to go the alternate route and picked up these new Adidas.Wow.The UltraRide blows away the Shox in terms of support, comfort, and stability. The ""cool"" factor is also very high with these shoes.Recommended over Shox"
190918,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
381253,1,"I love these, I fine them very comfortable, no problem to break them in, I have been wearing this brand for the last three year."
222477,2,This is the third pair of these shoes that I have owned. The previous two pair were comfortable and nice looking but this new pair has the look of pleather. Adding to the shoody appearance (which I thought I could improve with polish--with no success)is the annoying squeek that these shoes make when walking in them. I would not recommend purchasing them.
265052,1,They look good. They are very comfortable. I have wide feet and high arches the EEE was a good choice. Not made in America... but not made in China. Indonesia is not Indiana but better than China.
202889,1,"I purchased this sandal about a month ago and have worn it virtually every day since its arrival. I am well pleased with it as it is quite comfortable to the extent I wear it. I tend to shift in and out of several shoes during a day so I can not comment to its comfort if worn for extended time or over substantial distances.Mid-October, 2012. Still wearing these sandals, though with socks on some crispy days. My feet are happy in them. I have a painful right foot which has been problematic since my early teens. Dress shoes have always been an exercise in stoic endurance for me. Most shoes grow uncomfortable in a matter of hours. I habitually change footwear several times a day to keep things under control. As I have aged I have less padding on the soles of my feet resulting in mounting discomfort. Only one pair of Columbia hikers permitted me hike all over North and East Africa oblivious to my feet. Until these sandals. I have found that I can wear them nearly all day walking for miles, changing only when I get home. It must be wonderful to have normal feet. I hope you aren't taking yours for granted. Now that I getting old enough to not give a damn I may even evolve into wearing them with formal attire. Einstein got away with non-conformance to social conventions. I may just have to remain silent so that people think I must be brilliant, and eccentric. Happy feet."
356261,1,I buy tennis shoes on line all the time and they run true to size. I wear a 5 1/2 and have trouble finding certain shoes. When I read reviews that these shoes run small I ordered 1 size up and they fit just fine. The box said 61$'s and many in my class bought from a local shoe store for that price. So this is a very good deal. I'm an senior and love to TAP now!
255896,1,"Thank you for this shoe - I saw it at my aunt's and I had to have it. It looks great, fits great and wears well. Excellent price, great service - it arrived here before the date it said it was to get here - and in great shape. Now my mom wants a pair! Thanks again!"
80422,1,These shoes are the best things I Bought on amazon. I recomeend this product who wants the real converse. I love them and now i wear them everyday and everywhere i go!!! I cant wait till i buy or get my next pair!!
168061,1,"I've owned several pairs of these shoes and have always had complete satisfaction. They are comfortable and durable. If you search there website, Propet offers free shipping."
323330,1,"GOT WHAT I ORDERED, DELIVERED IN GOOD TIME, AND THEY FIT AS I EXPECTED, VERY COMFORTABLE AND A SUPER GOOD PRICE."
204533,0,"Really like the flip flops sandals - but the height of the soles don't match - one is at least an 1/8 to a 1/4"" higher than the other. I had already worn them before I realized what was wrong with them. So I guess I'm stuck with them (pitched the box & receipt). Have bought alot from Amazon in the past - never had a problem before. :(LindaDisappointed"
190578,1,They were wider than I had expected. Usually children's sizes run more narrow and these ran much wider. I needed to wear two socks and they were hard to break in.
14762,1,"extremely durable oxfords, universal shoes-great with dress slacks to jeans - clean styled boot toe. Comfortable street shoe. Like 'em lots."
15879,1,My 2 1/2 year old LOVES these shoes! And I think they are too cute!! Shoes are true to size. Perfect fit!
59684,1,"I have been buying Hi-Tec for years. When I found the Altitude IV I fell in love instantly. This shoe fits great, has little break in time and still holds its sturdiness as it ages. Well recomended."
164918,2,i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought!!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
352114,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
207543,1,"I just bought them and they look and feel wonderful. I highly recommend them, I can even run in them, they are that comfortable. The price is definitely right."
60829,1,"Most comfortable shoes I have found.After a few tests of brands and sizes, these are the best.I walk 5 to 10 miles a day .Once I found my size,my feet don't hurt or get tired.I add gel innersoles for extra comfort but it's not necessary.Concrete floors,ladders ,rough terrain,mud,rain;no problem.And they are beautiful.People ask me about them all the time.Enjoy."
119017,1,Love the fit and performance of my new Ryka water aerobics shoes. The only problem I have is that they tend to be slippery on the lane markers in the bottom of the pool.
25744,1,These shoes are really comfortable - so much so that I decided to stop wearing skateboard shoes altogether and just walk and skate in these.
333248,1,"My husband was having a hard time finding another pair of these at all, much less at the cost savings these were offered. Lovely and long wearing, he now has four pairs in case they have been discontinued."
154362,0,"I bought a pair of Seawalkers to use for weddings as I am a professional photographer.Pros: Leather body and sole has held up with four years of hard use; comfortable shoe; nice fit; non-slip soleCons: Eyelet grommets were sharp-edged so lacings frayed within a few months (had to take to a cobbler to fix the problem); rubber sole squeaks on linoleum and hard wood floors; expensive compared to similar quality ECCO shoes.Overall, nice shoes but suede begins to get old looking after a year or so. I have therefore purchased another ECCO shoe, the Boston lace-up, for wedding work. I would give the Seawalker 4-stars for comfort but having to pay a cobbler more money to fix the eyelets was a bummer, particularly on such an expensive shoe, so 3-stars in my book."
211568,1,"Just love this shoe. Not exactly the same as the old school but the changes are more comfortable. Visually, its just a slightly thicker sole. I highly recommend getting them."
103800,1,Bought for my husband he absolutely loves these shoes. Comfortable to the max. Wanted the senators but they were discontinued. Wish they weren't but he loved these too.
216992,1,these shoes were exactly what i was hoping for. they are my first pair of chucks and i must say i LOVE them!!! i want them in every color possible!=P super comfortable too...i could wear them forever!
144576,1,I like the color. It's not a common color - different but understated. Just wished that the bottom of the shoe could be more ergonoic and the shaft could be taller. Where it hits is not flattering to a woman.
13191,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
259368,1,Having a wide foot they fit a little on the narrow side - I kept them knowing that canvas will probably stretch without to much problem. Also my shoes make a slight hollow sound from one of the baby toe tips; I'm assuming with time that too will abate.
180578,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
82825,1,"I bought these sandals 3 years ago when I couldn't find my size in the thicker strap Reef's in store. I wasn't thrilled until I got them on. They are wonderful!I've now had them 3 years and they still look/feel great. These are a fabulous purchase, so I'm buying them again!"
154431,1,My 4 year old loves these shoes and he wears them almost everyday. They look very nice and my soon puts them without any help. They fit true to size. I would recommend these shoes to anyone.
229951,1,"Very good sneakers, the most comfortable ever. And also one of the cheapest! I'd like to try some of the new Converse models"
63189,1,"I have major problems finding size 9-1/2 medium in any shoe so I was pleased to find these at Fusion through Amazon. They are great, the fit is correct and very comfortable. Not much one can say about canvas tennis shoes but they are nice quality and more important, as I said before a good true fit."
335268,1,good indoor shoes. stylish as well. These are volleyball shoes which have enhanced outsole rubber for improved tractino and flexibility.fitting is ok. they just run a little narrow. I would suggest to buy half size up and wide if possible.
192922,1,"This shoe was superb when I used it for my highschool football team. I was able to run my fastest and not feel dragged down by a pound of lead, with out the high cut ankle support I was able to cut faster and throw off almost all of my defenders. This shoe really did enhance my perfromance. Ideal for wide receivers and running backs."
342525,1,"I just picked these up for my uniform working at A&F, and I gotta say there's a reason they'll never go out of style. These shoes are damn fine, and they're the only thing I own that'll really fit my flat feet. My roommate/coworker gets a lot of use out of them, too."
190323,1,I went looking for shoes for my nephew all black and these came up and the price is unbeatable that I got them and that 2 day free shipping is great. Thanks to my Kindle Fire HD 1 yr memebership...
327948,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
142973,2,"I have been wearing these Teva sandals for three years now, and I have to say that I was really disappointed with this year's crop of sandals. I used to love these sandals because the bottom part of the flip flop was so squishy and comfy and because they fit my narrow feet so perfectly. They were by far the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I would wear mine every day throughout the summer, until I wore the heels through!But this year, its seems that Teva decided that the fit was too narrow for the majority of their customers so they decided to make the fit a bit wider, the straps a bit looser. I tried on multiple different styles and colors while I was at the shoe store, and it seems that they've all be changed to fit this way. Unfortunately, this completely changed the comfortability of the sandal for me. Though they fit length-wise like they used to, they now feel like they're about two sizes too big for me and flop around way too much. Where before I would have rated these shoes 5+ stars, I can now only give them 2 stars. They are no longer my favorite sandals, and I really wish that Teva hadn't decided to mess with a sandal that would have been my favorite go-to summer sandal for years to come."
40147,1,"I thought the straps on this would bother me after parting with my old leather-strapped Reefs, which are no longer sold. I bought these along with a newer version of leather straps, and I favor these, surprisingly. I love them, and haven't had any problems with them yet!"
63074,2,"I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter. The color shows navy, but when they arrived they looked black...the box said navy! Had to return because of the shade."
68035,1,These boots are just what I was looking for. They are so easy to put on and get off. They are very comfortable
244472,1,"I've had a great experience with this brand and these super cute boots don't disappoint. I was looking for this style to add to my wardrobe but purchased these for the look. Although this style can be a little too masculine for me, the beautiful soft gray and pink color combination makes them a fashinable comination of sporty andladylike."
119440,1,"these are comfortable hard wearing, casual or light work boots. I love them would order many more pairs as they become available"
184040,0,"I ordered the Dansko Professional Pro Cabrio Leather Clog in a 36 EU (US Women's 5.5-6M) and it was much to big and I had to send it back.The quality of the shoe seemed fine, but it just was too big for my little feet."
49321,1,"Fue una muy buena compra, excelente calidad, tallas ideales, lindos dise&ntilde;os actuales. Recomiendo a todoas a comprar este producto, se llevar&aacute;n una buena sorpresa y le encantar&aacute; si es un regalo para alguien."
386649,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
332811,1,"Granted, at first glance one may not be too impressed with the looks of these shoes. I was one of these people. However, on a trip to Maine, I needed a pair of shoes that would serve well on land as well as in the water on trails and on the oceans. That being said, I discovered the true toughness and comfort of these shoes. I even hiked up a 3,000 foot mountain in these things and they still exhibit modest wear on the soles and around the entire shoe. This was extremely rocky and rugged terrain to boot and would not advise this as the primary terrain to tackle with Crocs.SIZINGI am a true 10.5 in mens. However, 10 was definitely too small and uncomfortable for me, so I bought size 11 since there are no half sizes. From this discovery, it is safe to say that Crocs are pretty true to size. 11s are a little big on me, but the strap still locks my foot in place and it does not feel like my foot is coming out of the shoe if I am not using the strap. The foam material Crocs are made from grips your feet pretty well, even when wet or sweaty.COMFORTThere are not many shoes, even shoes I've spent over $100, that can match Crocs in comfort. I could wear these shoes all day and my feet would not hurt or blister while on the trails. On a regular day out, same story. For summer, they are great because air is constantly able to flow through and cool your feet. When they get wet, I mean completely soaked, they usually will dry off within about 5 minutes.STYLEThese are really not as ugly as people think. Once you wear them and get them on, they really start to grow on you both on how they look and how they feel. People who say they hate these shoes are those who have never put a pair on and worn them (I was one of these people). As far as colors go, white and lighter colors seem like they will definitely get dirty easily. I have black and they are easy to clean of, just a rinse and rub down with a rag.The main thing is people just have to have an open mind when purchasing this style of footwear. They are a little unorthodox but they are high quality, functional, and as bad looking as people think. They are so easy just to slip on and they are featherweight and easy to walk in. I use them a lot for just getting the mail or going to the gym before I put my gym shoes on. I have been pleasently surprised with Crocs' resilience and highly recommend these bad boys."
250723,1,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas. He Loves them and expecially loves the side zipper for easy wearing. He received alot of compliments on the style. These boots are definately sharp lookingThey are made very well, durable, and very comfortable. I would definately buy these again without hesitation!"
267937,1,"This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
318575,1,"I am always looking for comfortable shoes. As I get older, regular dress shoes can be hard on my legs if I have to be on my feet for awhile. I have bought a lot of Rockport shoes and I like them for their style and comfort. Years ago I bought Hush Puppies and I stilll own a brown pair. I bought these shoes because of their color (I wanted a white shoe for the summer) and because I like/enjoy my other pair of Hush Puppies. For their comfort, color and style, these are excellent."
227035,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
234329,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
85853,1,"First things first. I expected them to be a bit bigger given that they're the biggest size. They fit just barely right. One centimeter smaller and they wouldn't have fit. I guess I got lucky.They're so comfortable that even after buying them for the beach, I ended up using them in my house during weekends. It's not a ""cushony"" comfortability, it just feels right and relaxing to wear them.If you plan to go to the park or somewhere outside other than the beach and the heat is above the 80's-90's and the humidity is high, you might want to reconsider taking them with you. You'll most likely get sweaty feet.For me, they're better than using any other type of sandal"
363390,1,"ordered for christmas for teen daughter, couldn't find anywhere in stores, so thanks! Appreciated the fast shipping too!"
154511,1,"This seems to be a nice, sturdy shoe. Unfortunately, I had to send mine back because they were too narrow for me. The wide width was out of stock, so I can't say how comfortable they are or how they hold up in the long run."
148936,1,"Just got a pair of these. I always wear street size 11, but based on other reviews I ordered size 11 1/2. These fit well, a little tight, but that should go away as they break in.So far seem to be well made."
88234,1,I LOVE these soues so much that I still gave them 4 stars after getting a pair that wasnt the right color (I ordered black and got grey) and also they run BIG so go a siz down from what your use to.
115046,1,"First of all I suggest 1/2 number less... if you compare it with adidas sneakers. The shoes are great, made with good materials, good design and very comfortable. I ordered these sneakers on black, but came gray on logo and the rear part, but there's no regret about it, looks so good. Definitely I recommend this item."
328668,1,I am on my third pair of these boots for everyday use. They fit well and are of high quality (but wish they were made in the USA). Still great quality and very comfortable. I will probably buy these boots as long as they are available. They last for a while and don't fall apart (I have had my share of crappy boots) Highly recommended!
196068,1,"At 46 years old, it has become more challenging for me to find flip flops I can wear all day, every day. But the croc style is perfect for my high instep/arch...allowing me to wear them on long walks even. I wish it was easier to find the plain colored styles at a reasonable price...I'd buy 5 pairs in all colors!"
72108,1,I was surprised to find out how light these moccasins felt. They are so soft and comfortable! You hardly realize you are wearing them. These are a nice shoe to wear on the hot days of summer. Highly recommend them.
224604,1,Ordered these for my granddaughter who is thrilled. They arrived in a short amount of time. Great service.
185805,1,"I purchased these for my husband for the holidays because I loved my Acorns and he can't wait to put them on when he gets home from work. Cushy, plushy, niiice."
225048,1,The color is amazing! If you wear any Brown Tees this is the must have shoe!
168669,0,"The sole is too heavy for the style of shoe. They are a bit too wide for a medium width. I love the look of them and the pink color is terrific, but they are heavy to walk in."
168835,1,"This is my 2nd pair of Propet walkers. I have the other pair that has mesh instead of solid leather, which are good for summer time but not winter when it's wet outside. I wanted a leather pair to keep the moisture out of my shoes when I'm outside & I do walk a lot so a good walking shoe is a must.I'm type 2 diabetic & was having some ingrown toe nail problems. After buying my 1st pair of these shoes, within 3 months I was able to get rid of the ingrown toe nail. The shoes have more toe room & are stable to keep my foot from rolling out when I walk. I was having lots of back pain, and if I don't get a good shoe like i said my foot rolls out & my ankles start to hurt.With these shoes I have no pain, am steady on my feet & the rubber sole is good to keep me from sliding around on wet floors: an added plus.I wanted to mention that these shoes are comfortable, they have a snug fit feel to them, but not so tight that your feet feel crammed. Earlier I was wearing these shoes because my feet were so swollen I couldn't get anything else on except slippers. These went right on, did not make my feet feel crammed, & with the heel pain I was having from the swelling i couldn't feel it.These are really some nice shoes, they are light weight & feel good after being on my feet all day walking around, even when I take the dog for a walk.I've cleaned out my closet of all the other favorite shoes I had, and only have these 2 pairs now. Nothing else can compare to how these feel for me & how well they keep my feet healthy."
244694,1,"I ordered this boot in the ""B"" (narrow) width, and the fit is perfect. I was grateful to Thorogood for making a narrow width. But now, a couple of months later, the company apparently makes this model only in D and wider. Other Thorogood work boots still come in B width. I ordered the same length that I wear in street shoes and am glad I did. At first I thought they might be too long, but then I realized that the length is intentionally generous because the last thing you want is your toes rubbing as you wrestle heavy loads all day."
207874,1,"I have always loved the huarache look. But normally most of them take awhile to break in to be comfortable.There was no ""break in time"". The first time I wore them I was on my feet all day.I plan to buy a few more pairs soon."
185392,2,"Got her fast, but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back. There should be a note on how to order Converse. One size smaller than your original foot size. Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big."
370212,1,"I have owned from 2 to 4 pairs of Top-Siders continuosly for over 30 years, wearing them daily for casual sports, sailing (really), and because of their comfort and the fact that the soles do not pick up any debris I wear them as house slippers as well.I have been in the water (overboard) several times with Top-Siders on and they have not hampered my swimming ability and they do not come off unless you want them to."

148617,1,Just as I ordered. Work perfectly for his practice games. Size wasaccurate. After washing still comfortable.I would recommend to anyone.
192257,1,"Most comfortable shoe I've ever worn... I have 2 pairs, black and brown, that I wear with just about everything year round. I should probably buy a back-up pair in case they quit making them..."
189163,1,"I loved this product on the first time when I wore it, and day by day this is getting better on each tennis class. Also thank you Amazon for dealing with great trades as this one."
355157,1,I find it hard to get chuck taylors in size 12 in stores around my area. It was nice to see they had them here on amazon in a mulitple of styles at great prices. The shipping was faster than I could of imagined and I plan to order future products from this provider.
225159,1,"I've used Converse sneakers for a little over a decade so I knew exactly what size to order, when I got them they were just perfect. Good to get dependable sizing and quality.They're more of a fashion item, in the most relaxed sense of the word, than running shoes.Did not need to contact vendor after placing the order, I got my notification of shipment and the package arrived on the promised date."
69419,1,"This is my 2nd pair of crocs. You can use them in the water, gardening and just putzing around. Great shoes."
350714,1,"Merrell makes fantastic shoes. These are my second pair of Merrell shoes. They're the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I highly suggest Merrell shoes. Once you wear them, you'll be sold, too :)."
293143,1,"This is the best brand of casual tennis shoes I have yet to find and I can only find a wide selection on Amazon.com. Most stores you can walk in to only carry the low-pro version, however Amazon offers more than one look of the original Jazz. Very pleased with the product--brand new, no defects."
366973,1,"I had never purchased Skechers before, but thought I'd try these after reading a few reviews.They are indeed one of the most versatile pairs of shoes I own. They look great with capris, jeans, shorts, skirts, everything! And they are so lightweight & comfortable, you'll reach for them again & again.Originally bought the black, exchanged for the natural, as I thought they'd be more versatile for summer. Would've liked both if I could've afforded it!"
285675,1,This is a time tested style that is mother approved (mother wore them in the '70s and '80s and was high scorer for years). I now buy them online and will open my own shop for shoes once the boys grow out of all the sizes I have bought over the years.
4433,1,Received these boots today and I have to tell you they are great. My feet after 74yrs hurt after taking my walk but i went today for a mile and my feet feel great. Now if i can get my hips to stop hurting we will be ready for that five mi.Thanks Hi-Tec AND AMAZON For the great price and fast shipping.
78774,1,"These are my 4th pair of Converse, the shoes are comfortable, affordable and a classic! I already have them in black, navy blue and graffiti, so I decided to get a color more on the girly side so my friends stop saying ""are you into the emo thing now?"" , that didn't work, but I have a new pair of low tops that I totally adore!!The shipping with lasership was incredibly fast I ordered on sunday with Free Shipping and got them Wednesday!!"
60282,1,I'm have never been disappointed with a Hi-Tech shoe. The Altitude is a fantastic boot and nicely priced. My last pair lasted four year and I just bought another. Better waterproofing than my gore-tech hikers. I try other hikers but I keep coming back to Hi-Tec.
225749,1,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
327454,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
98434,1,We purchased these boots for our 17 year old son and he loves them. They are very durable and nice looking at the same time. Well worth the money!
253179,1,"These were perfect but at least a size (or two) bigger, so if you are ordering order a size smaller!"
289567,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
42805,1,i am extremely pleased with the product it was exactly what i wanted for my husband.thank you amazon.
283794,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
280913,1,I originally ordered the wrong size. Amazon arranged an exchange and I am enjoying the sneakers. I always have a good experience with Amazon.
180972,0,"These shoes look great but they are very heavy and bulky when they're on your feet. I returned them, sadly, because I love mules and hoped they would work out."
103870,1,"These shoes are as comfortable as a walking shoe, but much less dull! Now that I have some arthritis in my toe joints, comfort is even more important, so these shoes were a lucky find. I'm comfortable and in style even walking many blocks. Of course, they work great for biking, too. I usually wear size 9, but find these fit best if I order a half size up."
256734,1,These boots are wonderful! My Husband gets the most comfort out of these! Love them.... You can work in them and wear to Dress them! great boot.
263475,1,"This pair is at least my tenth pair of samba classics I have owned. What keeps me buying them over and over again is the comfort, style, and functionality of the shoe. As a soccer player my first pair was purchased to use for indoor soccer but they made their way into my closet as an everyday shoe. They are comfortable enough play a full game on turf or to wear casually for hours at a time. The black shoe with three white stripes on the side is a classic adidas design that looks good with anything. The reason I have had to purchase so many pairs has nothing to do with the quality of the shoe but because these are the shoe I will put on 8/10 times, I usually end up with a new pair about once every year and nothing looks and feels better than having on a fresh pair of sambas."
1964,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
199373,1,"I ordered the timberland Boat Shoes from Amazon. I like to moccassins in the house, slipping them off for out door shoes. These were exactly as described and pictured, Fit just right and have the thick soles I like.Often the size is not exact [or at least doesn't conform to other shoe vendors sizes) but these shoes fit as do most other shoe orders I have placed. These required no ""break-in"" as some moccassins do.Just as important to me is the shape of the shoe and quality of the shoe materials. Just what I expected from the listing"
297532,1,"My husband had bought slip-on leather shoes (loafer type) from the Bass Outlet and then gone on a business trip. When he returned, his feet were covered with blisters. He remembered that his tie Rockports were easily the most comfortable shoes he owned. We ordered the slip-ons on sale (same as the Bass outlet shoe price)through Amazon. They came in two days, even though we didn't order special handling. They feel ""like slippers,"" he says. He wears them all the time. The contrast to the Bass shoes was startling. No blisters, no break-in period...just affordable comfort."
147366,1,"This is the first time buying Uggs! Now I realize why style & comfort combine when wearing Uggs. These cozy, lightweight warm boots are a real treat & great to wear with skinny jeans & leggings. I'll just apply the right treatment for weatherproofing these gorgeous chocolate brown Uggs! Real nice Xmas present to myself!!!"
189246,1,"Product came in a timely fashion...was at a good price ....& is exactly like the higher priced versions. My husband is a happy ""camper""!"
286828,1,"When a grey 45"" lace is needed, a color/length combination difficult to find, just go to AMAZON. The osrdering experience was fine, but the mailing cost way more than the laces."
86040,1,"My parents treat my family to Christmas in Vail each year. I have always admired, by far, the gorgeous fur boots that the wealthy sport on the mountain. Since I was a child, I wanted a pair of my own...I have searched the web for years to find a pair that we could budget for - that look like the $350+ boots I coveted. I was excited when I saw these! However, due to the review that was posted, I was worried about the quality when I ordered them.When they arrived, I was so relieved! The feathers do not appear to easily fall off as the other review stated. The boots are top quality. I am very fussy. This actually is the first review I am inspired to take the time to write. I wear an 8 1/2 and ordered a 9, it is a perfect fit!Comfortable and stylish! Totally LOVE them! Now when I am skiing with my family over the holiday I can pretend to be one of the wealthy trophy wives for the week! Ha!~Jennifer"
386046,1,"Having reviewed numerous other styles of 'casual' type sneakers, I opted to go with several pairs of this New Balance style, in different colors. But I particularly favor this particular Navy / Grey color style. Stylish and comfortable, I haven't any complaints after wearing these for several weeks now (and I've even ordered a second pair of this color scheme)."
263547,1,This is a good looking and comfortable shoe for indoor court use. I use it for relatively low impact refereeing.
288662,1,I love Reebok so much. The shoes are so comfortable and the other stuff is also really great! All my friends and I have at least 6 pairs of reebok shoes in our closets. And the designs are really great too.
1976,1,"First off, I would just like to say that have a 14W shoe size which makes shopping very difficult, until now, on Amazon. This was actually the first pair of shoes I bought and actually wanted. Usually I take what I can get. I've worn them every day for the past 1-2 months, and I love them. They didn't require much breaking in and are a very comfortable fit. They are super light. My father lifted them to take a closer look and said in amazement, ""They're light!"" The Waterproof function of the shoe works very well, which i am glad of, because wet socks are no friend of mine. I have no need for them now, but I almost want to buy another pair just because. After a few hikes I will post how well they fair on the hills."
345883,1,"I love my new shoes! they fit great and look great. My daughter keeps taking them so I may have to get her a pair. nah, let her get her own!!"
41784,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
103465,1,This is defenitely one great pair of boots! It's very soft and comfortable. I recommed to use it with long socks.
200752,1,"These are very stylish, while still staying casual. My fiance loves them. Pair them with jeans, or with some great pants, and they look really nice. They go well with the newer style of the straight legged pants for men - the slightly flared older pants he has don't look as good with them."
288205,1,"I bought these a while back, and have to tell you these are my favorite go-to sandals. Very comfy and good padding for lots of walking. Will buy more of this style, in other colors, come spring. They run true to size and width."
296226,1,"After a rare snow and ice storm here in Atlanta, I slipped on my driveway and broke my leg (in two places). Among my get-well wishes were a couple suggestions that I should have purchased Yaktrax, which I had never even heard of. My leg healed quickly, but soon had to travel to Moscow on business. I ordered a pair to make sure I wouldn't re-injure my almost-healed leg. They were amazing! And everyone in Moscow was amazed, too. They had never seen anything like it, either. I would keep them in a Delta Airlines amenity bag I got from the plane and carry in my pocket until going outside, then put them on my shoes. I made it to and from Moscow safe and sound and now have them in my closet awaiting the next inclimate weather or my next trip to Russia."
260795,1,This a a great classic shoe--just too bad they're not made in the USA anymore.
308076,1,These shoes were 20$ cheaper than the sale price on the converse website. The shoes seem to be authentic. Shipping was fast.
235864,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
283654,1,"The pictures of this item do not do these boots justice. These are extremely sexy! They are high quality and very comfortable. I agree with other reviewers about sizing; they run from a half size to a full size small. For me, this worked out great as i wear a 5 to 5 1/2, and the smallest size available is a 6."
212276,1,"This is a very nice looking shoe and it has a nice ""bounce"" to it. However, I strongly urge anyone ordering to order at least one size up. It is not true to size, at all. I am a first time Asics purchaser. So, now I know. However, I still like them a lot. Great for high impact exercise/speed walking/running. They look nice too!"
245777,0,"They looks cheaper in person than on picture, and didnt fit that nicely (I have a bit bigger calves for a small person). Didnt take me long to figure out I needed to return them."
253711,0,"Its not that comfortable for the original price, thank God i bought it when it was on sale!!!. They are good for the water cause your feet are always dry."
365113,1,"These were a favorite of mine growing up. The quality seems a tad better these days than when I was growing up. They're not as comfortable asjogging or walking shoes, but there is a certain casual nostalgia when wearing them. These are not uncomfortable shoes mind you. If youare accustomed to High tech arch support and cushioned soles, these are not the shoes for you. But if you are looking for a basic shoe for youreveryday wear & tear, that have the nostalgic look of the late 50's-60's, look no further."
97239,1,These clogs are so comfortable. I work in a cooking school and this is the first time I can remember coming home without aching feet. Thank you Quark!
356719,1,"I have this shoe in black, size 10. It's comfortable and the style is classic yet refined. However, it is a bit narrow so if you have average to wider feet, you might want to order a wide."
114921,1,"ITS A GOOD PRODUCT, THE ONLY BUT I SEE, IS THAT THE MATERIAL FEELS VERY SYNTETHIC, BUT OVERALL, ITS A GOOD PRODUCT, I BOUGHT THESE AS A PRESENT FOR A FRIEND AND NOW SHE IS VERY HAPPY BECAUSE SHE GOT WHAT SHE WAS EXPECTING."
126877,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
25624,1,"I just purchased my second pair of these shoes, after completely wearing out the first pair. They're comfy, fast to slip on and off, and I can even walk the dog around the block without my feet tiring. Overall, a good shoe."
315379,1,I've had these heels for a few years now and they are still holding strong. I've worn them quite a bit and there's not much wear and tear at all. Definitely worth purchasing.
380777,1,"This shoe is awesome. If you appreciate the kitten heel and added stability of an ankle strap, this saucey little dancing shoe is for you. Always order 1/2 size up and consider the wide version if you don't like the feel of a form fit, these babies are very slender and run small. I'm wearing these to work and out dancing with the boyfriend and they've been fab so far. love them!"
358678,1,"I was going crazy looking for a leather soled shoe that would fit. This shoe does run small. I ordered a half a size bigger and I can manage with that, but I think I could have ordered a full size bigger and it would have been a little better. Also, I do have wide feet so I ordered the wide width that was available. I'd say the width runs true. The foot strap secures with a buckle and not that loathsome velcro, that never stays closed.I would recommend this product, with the size adjustment caveat. I have flat feet so the arch support seams light moderate to me. The heel has good depth and the toe box is comfortable for my wide foot."
12423,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
342732,1,"I've been shopping around for a good pair of Converse for a while, thinking that I could find them for under $20.00 if I looked hard enough. My last pair, which I bought three years ago, was $20, and I thought surely I could find more for less than the $35-45 price tag I was seeing. Stupid inflation.I finally bought these when I realized if I was going to get a new pair, I had to cough up the extra dough. I'm really glad I did. I wore the last pair all the time, and though they're still comfortable and I'm far too attached to them to throw them away, they have holes in the leather and in the sole, and they smell something foul when it rains. I have no doubt that these canvas Converse Chuck's will last just as long and be just as comfortable, and my first few wears makes me confident that I'm right. My last pair was leather, but the same shoe style, so I don't know if the fabric of these will stretch. I do know that the leather ones never did, it only got a little less structured after three years of wear.What I like:1. These are meant to wear as regular sneakers, so while you don't want to go on a run with them, they are just as comfortable if you're going on a long walk. There's no chafing on the heel no matter how far I go, and the support means they're not going to destroy your lower back if you find yourself walking or standing all day.2. For me, at least, they fit true to size. I have wide feet, but the design of the shoe means I can lace them tighter or looser and not worry about them cutting into my circulation or falling off.3. I got the navy blue ones, and the color is exactly what you see in the product picture. It's vibrant, but not bright, and well-dyed and even-toned.As for dislikes, well...there's nothing I dislike about Converse, so you're asking the wrong person if you're looking for complaints. All Converse I've ever owned are comfortable and simple, and I think it's what the brand does best."
168422,1,The shoes are versatile and very comfortable. Sizing is accurate and the price is right. I am pleased with my purchase. Good buy.
139288,1,This is the 10th pair of Supernova Cushions I have purchased and I love them. They have a very thick cushion and it has cured my shin splints.
194103,1,This product was just as I thought it would be and the shipping time was great as well!!!
183014,1,"Great style. feel good and fit well. Quality leather, good stiching, quality heal and sole with smooth finish. Will buy again in future."
361237,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
97734,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
224311,1,I've been wearing Chuck's since I was a kid.....still wearing them....I'm in my 40's now. Great tennis shoe....tons of colors....I have 4 pairs.A Classic!!
298087,1,These are very comfortable and the look and feel is very well made.Highly recommended.
374641,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
49899,1,"great product , exceeded my expectations , would shop here again.Amazon is sych a great place to find the unuasual things that you are looking for.Highly recommmend it."
108224,1,"These sandals are great! I've been wanting to wear flip-flops for the warmer months, but hate how they feel between my toes. I can barely feel the difference in these ones! The only thing people might want to keep in mind is that these particular ones are somewhat narrow."
106997,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
249563,1,"I got these for my husband for Christmas to replace a pair he previously had that were starting to fall apart. When making a quick trip to run errands or to take the dog out, he slips on his 'house shoes' so it was important to have a solid tread on the bottom of the shoe and these are really great!"
111566,1,This product was just as I thought it would be and the shipping time was great as well!!!
209272,1,"Since I wear a hard to find shoe size (9 N), it has been more and more difficult to find a practical shoe in stores in our location (even in N.Y., City). I was delighted to find the The Enzo Angiolini ""Liberty"" shoe through Amazon. It's perfect for casual and dressy casual wear - shopping and running to the dentist or doctor. Ordering was easy and service was prompt. I'll do it again in the future."
170996,0,I have a narrow foot and the AA fits ok. Well made shoes. I am not too crazy about how high they come on my ankle but I knew that when I bought them. Thought I would give them a try.
360978,1,"What can I say, this is a pretty basic straight forward sandal. Very comfortable. The toe area is indented slightly matching to your foots contour which makes them extra comfortable in my opinion. Its not just a flat surface. This is my second pair. My first pair lasted well over a year before my border collie turned them into her personal chew toy. Very durable. The bottom of the sandal is a very grippy material. The butterscotch colored bottom will not mark up your boat or floors which is an added benefit if you are spending time in the boat. These are great sandals...not too much more to say."
336138,1,"I asked for and got a pair of Crocs via Amazon.com for Christmas 2010. They fit fairly well, more comfortable with socks, size 14, black. The right is a bit bigger that the left. I wear them for the most part in the house, wood, tile and carpet flooring. You would expect them to wear slow on those type of surfaces but I noticed that after only two months of use, 4-5 hours per day, the tread has worn away about the heel and beneath the big toes. I do not drag my feet so I should expect a longer lasting shoe. I don't expect them to last more that 6 months. Based on comfort I give 5 stars, for lasting quality 3 stars. For the $44.95 you would expect them to last a year. I'll let you know if your willing to sit there and wait. Oh! go order a pair you'll like them, while they last"
158716,1,"This is the best running shoe I have ever owned! I had trouble with my LCL, not anymore. I used to start to get tired after 4 miles, I can go twice as long with these. If you have flat, narrow feet and small ankles, this is the shoe for you. Pretty good arch support. Could use more, but I'm not complaining!! I hope they never discontinue this shoe!"
79182,1,"This purchase was another gift for Christmas. I bought this particular pair of shoes for my wife. Although it was not a direct Amazon.com purchase and I was redirected to another site, the process was easy. The shoes were shipped fast and on time, there was great communication from the site that sold them. Another great purchase!"
128731,1,"Great shoe for winter, but too warm for summer. You need an insert or socks for this shoe or you will sweat too much in them. Very comfortable otherwise."
209401,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband because he is on his feet all day. He enjoys wearing them and states that he has not had any cramps in his legs or feet. The only thing that I notice about them that I am unsure of is the material on the upper part, toe area. It appears a little thin, but perhaps that is because this a walking shoe. I am hoping they are able to endure his daily routine."
366715,2,The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so. The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality.
335235,1,These are nice boat shoes. Look good & fit well. I like the elevated heel & sole as opposed to the flat bottom shoes. When I wear 'em out I'll buy another pair.
197587,1,"Fits well, Looks good.Price was right. Much more comfortable than rental shoes. Will pay for themselves in 6 trips to the Bowling Alley."
326225,0,They didn't have the color I wanted so I settled for a different color shoe.
58668,1,Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds. She loves them.
276823,0,"I have only had these shoes for a short time and maybem they need to br broke in a little, but the arch area is a little uncomfortable."
344605,0,"This is an exceptionally good looking shoe, however, the sole is not as thick as the Rockports my son has enjoyed in the past and says he can feel the rocks pushing up through the sole where he didn't feel that in the Rockports.Thought we'd give these a try and again they are gorgeous, but we'll be going back to the Rockports after this.Seller was very fast and there is no way to compare these to anything else unless you've owned both. We'd buy from this seller again."
85606,1,"As a daily runner and marathoner, I was in the market for a new pair of running shoes. I considered the Nike Shox, but after a few tries with them I decided to go the alternate route and picked up these new Adidas.Wow.The UltraRide blows away the Shox in terms of support, comfort, and stability. The ""cool"" factor is also very high with these shoes.Recommended over Shox"
344346,1,MY GRANDSON ORDERED THESE FOR HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. THEY WERE THE PERFECT FIT AND VERY COMFORTABLE FOR HIM.
161189,2,"Image shows Purple HI TOPS, but when you order....you get LO tops. Also, items that say 'qualifies for super saver shipping!' they're not. So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops...don't fall for it!"
254341,2,I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother. The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it.
68404,1,THESE SHOES ARE SHARP. GREAT QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP.THE FIT IS GOOD AND COMFORTABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THEM.I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT THE SAME.
272753,1,"I love these flip flop. This is my second pair of Teva flip flops. They are so comfortable, I do not want to take them off. I have flat feet so I have problems finding comfortable flip flops. They are not only comfortable but they look great. I will buy more of the Teva shoes."
165107,1,These shoes are to die for. I ordered them at 7pm and they were on my door step at 3pm the next day! Great fast shipping and amazing quality for what I paid.
172192,1,"This are super confortable shoes if you do not mind the 'men' look. Great with pants. Wear for 8h or longer with no pain, padding is extraordinary. The brown is beautiful."
236459,0,"I ordered 9.5's, because that's what I normally wear, but the shoes don't have any padding to speak of, so they feel a little big. I like the look, so I'll probably go get some Dr. Scholl's Inserts and start gellin' like a fellon."
299790,0,"I ordered a 40, what was supposed to be a women's size 9, but these were way too big. At least 2 sizes. I found a store that sold these and ended up with a size 38. I was told by someone else they had the same problem. Now that I know my correct size I would have no problem buying these again."
94488,1,THIS IS MY 4TH PURCHASE OF THIS SHOE STYLE. USUALLY THERE IS A NEW SHOE BREAK IN PERIOD BUT WITH THIS SHOE IT'S COMFORTABLE FROM THE FIRST WEARING UP TO THE FINAL WEARING. I'M SURE I'VE PUT MORE THAN THE 1000 MILE GUARANTEE ON EACH OF THE PREVIOUS PAIRS BUT I LIKE THAT THERE IS A WARRANTY ON THE SHOES. AND THE PRICE IS GREAT TOO!
42144,1,These boots are the only ones my husband will own. He's on his third pair. He wears them at least five days a week and wears them until they are coming apart. They last him roughly two years. Great value!
348670,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
205744,1,"I love the look, quality is good, but I gave it 4 stars because they run very small. I recomend ordering size up."
294376,1,This is a great boot and my son loved it. We live in Hawaii and went home for Thanksgiving to Idaho. Since my son had never worn boots like this we were concerned he wouldn't do well with them. But he really loved them and they survived two weeks in the rain and snow of Washington and Idaho. And they looked great on him! I definitely recommend them.
48425,1,"Love these shoes, they are sooooo comfortable and hold up very well, I wear them all the time."
360143,1,"I use a 10 1/2 W, 1/2 a size bigger than I wear for a sneaker, in this shoe. The heel is comfortable, and I can stand or dance in these for hours with no problem. They are also fine with slacks for a regular day."
132402,0,"The ballet shoes are very nice, but not true to size. My granddaughter (age 4) wears a size 7, I ordered a 7.5 to give her room to grow, and they were too small! Some advice about the sizing would have been helpful. Now we have to send them back."
13551,0,"I bought these as character shoes for opera performance. They are very uncomfortable for now and I cannot wear them more than an hour without swearing, but all the singers I work with tell me that once you wear them for a while, they become very comfortable..."
324060,1,So far I am very pleased with these less expensive versions of Birkenstocks. Haven't noticed any lack in quality and of course love the comfort of these shoes. Birkenstocks (and Betula's) are the best!
235289,1,I love these shoes! They are comfortable and stylish. I have gotten nothing but great complements from them. Well worth the money!
53384,1,"I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years, love them. They were exactly what I odered, no problems"
217503,1,"Im not a big fan of sneakers, but these shoes I now want in every color. They are so comfortable and a must have to every college student. Love them!"
64682,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
323578,0,Insoles are permanently glued in so that orthotics can not be installed. Insoles in shoes give no arch support.Returned them
136933,1,I got them today around the time they said they would be here. The shoes were in great condition inside the box and they were just what I expected to be. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would order from them again.
340248,1,very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!
74600,1,"This is a high quality product. The shoes are quite comfortable and can take the beating of a big city sidewalks. I have had them for 6 months and use them 3-4 times a week and they are still in the ""almost new"" shape. The price is pretty good too."
59467,1,"these are very nice, comfortable and can be worn outside and inside. Very Soft"
289378,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
278463,1,I looked all over for these shoes found them at a great price and love them so much and will buy another pair very soon as these ones are almost destroyed
103474,1,"I find this pair of Reebok running shoes to be of excellent quality. They are very comfortable and cushion the shock of walking. I am past the running age, so I need a good foundation and arch support. The price was right also. Reebok is the best name in sport shoes in my estimation. Thank you. I hope this helps."
123981,1,"For over 25 years I have relied on Softspots for casual wear. The shoes are durable and very comfortable. Great for travel and slip off going through airport security. The range of color choices (black, navy, brown, taupe) add a plus."
254996,0,"This boots look great, materials feel lush and pleasant. However, the feel and comfort for the feet is way too original - looks like they were not designed as a normal modern shoes, look like 'how simple the shoe can be created'. They look great, and feel nice, but don't expect comfort. Sizes fit perfectly, no need to order larger/or especially smaller unless you need some torture for your feet."
28928,1,"I love these sandals. I got the brushed leather ones, and they are very comfortable. They have some arch support and all the straps adjust for a comfortable fit. I wear a 7.5 in most shoes and that is what I ordered in these. They fit me perfectly."
85371,1,"I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years. I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street. They are VERY COMFORTABLE, ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe.They felt like a favorite, comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on...SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction,logging or concrete work. Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT, I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread, giving you fair traction in the grass, snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also...the boot's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor, while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact. Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection. I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof, you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment. KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather, material, sewn seams splitting or tearing, and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off, however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So, I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots...Order a bit thicker,round nylon boot laces, instead of the flat, cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However, trust me, your wife will remind you,often, to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought,have been just as happy with, are the White's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $500.00The FARM BOOTS are a great deal! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care /pride in the product,a good design philosophy, used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country, when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
351238,1,"This is a great shoe, though I find that it runs narrow. I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all. My right foot wentin with some effort. It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in. I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato"
117019,1,"got these, in brown leather ""croc"" for my husband who saw them someplace but had a very hard time finding them in his size (12) - he loves them - they're super comfortable and very good looking. For Reef lovers, and flipflop lovers, we highly recommend."
156593,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
83295,1,"These are warm, comfy and fit well. Just as I expected. There is only one problem and that is they shed alot. I still would purchase them in spite of that, hoping it will stop."
169288,1,I've purchased these Minnetonka suede mocs while on vacation in the U.P. for many years and was delighted to see them for sale on Amazon.com. The same size is always the same size so no worries about having them not fit.
271575,1,"I bought these for my sister as a birthday present. She loves them! The style is sassy and the heel is just the right height. It seems to be well constructed. I noticed the other review said the suede was worn looking around the side and toe area and this is true for this pair as well. I believe these are made to look this way on purpose to give it a slightly worn look, much like they design jeans these days. All in all this was a great purchase."
343801,1,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
72279,0,"I love these Eastland shoes but can't seem to find them anymore. I was excited to see them on Amazon as my old pair is looking quite worn. When I got them, they were too small! I guess I learned my lesson and won't purchase shoes online again. I just did my first ever return to Amazon and will see how that goes. By the way, I have worn the same size shoes for years!"
244545,1,"Per Wife: Comfortable fit, as always with Hushpuppies. Looked great and was a good match for my dress. Glad I bought this. just know your shoe size for dress shoes in US sizing. Is very good with keeping to the US shoe template and quality is usually very high. Very happy with the shoes."
165895,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
134012,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
234634,1,"These shoes last long and looks great, just like the first day I brought them, and I recommend this product and seller to anyone. This was an AAAA++++ transaction and product. Thanks"
107310,1,"I bought a pair of these shoes (in Espresso/Creme) for walking, because I'm a college student and I do a lot of walking around on campus every day. The sales person at Foot Locker did not recommend them for walking, but I do. They're comfortable, feminine, and very nicely designed. The shoe is made of breathable leather (a must for this Texas heat!), and fits my foot very nicely. In addition, the padded insole is much more comfortable than a regular tennis shoe. And don't let the thin soles fool you - this shoe is durable!As an Adidas &quot;fan&quot;, I'd recommend this shoe simply because Adidas makes high quality, long-lasting shoes. As someone who needs comfortable shoes, I recommend this pair not only because of the quality, but also because of the comfort they offer. The fact that they're also quite cute (at least, I think so) is an added bonus. Overall, this is a great pair of shoes, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a sturdy and comfortable, yet stylish, pair of shoes for an active lifetsyle."
63417,1,"They really do keep any water from getting in, and they are quite warm! Don't know what I'd do without them with winter coming along."
175840,1,"MRS BOWLES WAS ""VERY PLEASED "" WITH THE PRODUCT, THE SPEED OF DEV., AND THE ACCURACY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS.WE FELT LIKE WE ""WERE FAVORITE CUSTOMERS""...."
198932,1,"These arrived very quickly and were as advertised, brand new in box. I havent been able to find them in stores, thanks for having them available. Happy customer here."
335186,1,I wanted a shoe that I can use like a slip-on. Buying without trying was a bit scary. I'm happy to say I didn't have any problems. It is a well made shoe. You won't find something like this at Walmart. A helpful hint here....if you spill kerosene on one shoe you might as well dump some on the other one too. They're real leather.
167134,1,"I wear these when I visit my parents' ranch. I am used to flip flops but out in the country where there are snakes... closed-toe shoes are kind of a necessity. They're VERY comfortable and fit great, and I can slide them right on and go. Very nice material and well made."
308977,1,"The shipping was quick, and the product was in perfect condition. Expensive shipping though..."
343722,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
56302,1,My teenager picked these out. she loves them enough to wear them at least 2x a week and says they are comfortable. I like that they don't show dirt.
279899,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
99178,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
183942,1,"My daughter loves these. They are what the nursing professionals wear, but in white. They are supposed to be the MOST comfortable thing on the planet. They have a nice 'cushioned' walk due to what the entire sole is made of but the deceiving part is that you think they are 'hard' on the inside. They have an arch support that is the key. Much like Power Steps that you can put into your workout shoes in place of the innersoles they come with (Power Steps are STILL better than ANY athletic shoe puts in at the factory) they support you entirely so it reduces fatigue. I have found that wearing even the Rainbow Sandals all the time do that, and I wish I could wear these, but my husband is 'of short stature' so I would tower above him in them (which I would hate) and they would also make my size 8 foot look HUGE! So, I'm sticking with my Rainbows but they are DARLING on my daughter (who is so petite) and once she broke them in she loves them. I am sure she'll still be wearing them in 10 years!!! GREAT SHOE!!!! Good deal too if you already know your size!!!"
329179,0,"I read super reviews, and wanted the best, so I bought these. I am quite disappointed, actually. I am a girl, maybe that made the difference. The toe cap rubbed my toes something fierce. The soles are super, I loved that about them. But they are really heavy and I clump everywhere. This has not changed in 2 months. I have strong legs, so this is not a weakness issue. They have a bit of a pointed toe, too. I do not think these are sexy, on me or anyone else. Danner has been nice enough about my issues, but I forsee a lot of money continuing with these. For standing long periods, these are probably great. But I will have to run, walk and try to be stealthy. Forget it with these! Maybe in a year or two, they will be quieter? I tried to buy American, but these are just not that great. Sorry.. I see that another man has said the same things, now that I re-read the reviews. I will try to walk through a river, or let the sun soften them. I hope it helps, otherwise I just flushed over $300./04/2012 Amazon gave me a full refund, as apparently these were defective. The toe box killed my toe and when they realized it was a defect and not preference, they fully refunded my money. They treated me like they wanted to keep my business. Good customer service!So, I guess these have the potential to be great boots, like others seem to think they are. Just keep in mind that they are heavy. The pros are that they are very easy on and off, well made, and the sole is very comfortable and protective. My feet felt well cared for."
64985,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
144230,1,Firstable I have to say that the service was perfect!!! They were perfectly in time and I really like them. They are warm and confortable. You must buy a smaller size. I usually wear 8/5-9 and I bought 8. Thank you Amazon!! and Happy Holidays to everybody!
163298,0,Actual size was about a full size maybe even two sizes smaller than what they were labeled as. Had to return them. Pink glitter was all over the floor by just trying on one shoe so beware of glitter shedding
379349,1,"Great seller, Super fast shipping. These are a great pair of shoes. They just have to be broken in before they'll truly preform at their best."
70534,1,I have narrow feet and it's difficult to find shoes in my size. These were size 13 B and fit fine and are good walking shoes.
237850,1,Broke in right out of the box. I would buy again and again. Most comfortable boots I have ever owned when I put them on they felt like a broke in pair
93875,1,"This is my second pair I have purchased of this type and model. Boot wears out slowly - especially on the top and front where wear typically shows first. Sole eventually wears out, but wearing daily can last 2 years or longer. Very comfortable and flexes nicely, while standing up to abbasions well. I would recommend some type of conditioner if the boots will be exposed to water or liquids on a regular basis.Personaly, I prefer saddlesoap."
188493,1,"comfortable, great feel. only draw back is that the product was made in Vietnam. Has been great for on the job."
316703,0,"The ad showed a picture of the shoes with dark gray stripes, but the ones they sent were solid white; I can live with the color difference, but the shoes seemed to fit kind of tight and were hard to break in, so you may want to order a larger size in this one."
44770,1,"I have these sandals in five different colors. They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish, and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play. Although they are not leather, they look and feel just like it. Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable, inexpensive sandal."
329474,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
85946,1,Dark Red boots - many compliments received! AK is always a good purchase.
308067,1,What can I say? These shoes are insanely comfortable and go with everything. The more worn they get the better they look.
290444,1,"I personallyu play soccer with the white pair of the Beck designed ones. They are comfortable and very useful for curve shots. The pricing, shipping and handling are convenient and easy. I recommend this seller."
381803,1,These shoes are great! This is the first time I ordered them online and they came in fast. This is my fourth pair of sketchers and I will definitely keep ordering them.
66680,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
364888,1,"My granddaughter absolutely ""...had to have, more than anything in the world..."" a pair of Converse Purple High-tops for Christmas! Ordered them on 12/19 & they arrived on the 22nd, in plenty of time for me to once again be ""the greatest grandpa in the world""!"
331402,1,"Love the color ""cotton candy"", it is really cute without being too loud. These are super comfortable. True to size."
311156,1,"Great product. Does run slightly smaller, so I took the advice of others and ordered a 1/2 size larger. Fits perfectly. Arrived quickly, too."
358321,0,I had to order a pair of these for my daughter for a play she is in. Normally she is between a 5 1/2 and a 6. We purchased a 6 1/2 thinking we would be ok... nope! Way too tight! We are returning the 6 1/2. After calling around we found a place about 35 minutes away that has one pair which turns out is a 7. My advice if you order these.... order 2 LARGER pairs at the same time and return the ones that don't fit since size seems to be a common issue with these shoes.
261135,1,If you are reading this review you probably already own a pair of Chucks. I love the look and feel of the Lo Top ones. They look great and feel great.
149898,1,"I basically wore nothing but these shoes, when they were made by Adidas, back in the 1970's/early 80's. The fit and quality was great and you could really move in them. Of course, after they stopped making them and my last pair wore out I was out of luck. I've had many other types of running/athletic shoes since, but always wished I could find some forgotten stash of that old Adidas model again. When I saw these shoes I was pretty surprised and hopeful, but when I found out Adidas owned Reebok I got excited! I have 3 pair now and I'm completely satisfied with them. Same fit and feel, with the added bonus of remembering good times from the past each time I wear them. If you remember these and liked them back then, do yourself a favor and get a pair. You won't be disappointed."
20320,1,May just be the best looking walking shoe on the planet. Its designed for real walking - not just to look like it.
165456,1,I have used Easy Spirit when I show my dogs for several years. They are light weight and have good traction when moving my dog. I wore my last pair for several years until my new puppy chewed them.
2517,1,"These boots are often on sale for $50 or less. That is a fantastic value for a all-leather waterproof hiking boot. These boots are not the lightest weight, but they are fairly durable. The leather is a little stiff when new, but breaks in quickly to give you a very comfortable semi-custom fit. The wide, thick sole gives you great stability on and protection from rocky trails. These boots do have an EVA midsole, so they won't last for years like high-end boots with polyurethane midsoles, but these do cost half the price of high-end boots."
71311,1,I love the Nova Pumps which are true to size and very confortable. I lovethe pumps.
300423,1,I'm a size 8 1/2 in womans and I'm in love with these great fashion statement. Keeps my feet warmm
187004,1,"I bought these boots for a costume, and after 2 years of average use (6-12 hours a month) they are still going strong.I ordered size 13 mens, and it came a little large, as if it was a wide, but nothing a simple insert couldn't fix.I am very happy with my purchase, and they have held together more than I thought they would. I was a little concerned about quality because the price was so good, but I have not been disappointed.I will definitely purchase from Pleaser again for my next boots."
74300,1,These are great all around shoes for toddlers and pre-schoolers. They are easy to put on and very easy to keep clean.
262497,1,"I bought this pair from a plus-size catalog, and have been extremely pleased with them. My flat feet are clown-sized and wide, and I'm partly disabled (one foot is usually swollen), so you can imagine how difficult it is to find comfy shoes. This brand and model is very lightweight and cushioned as I walk. The light weight is important because I don't have to stomp around in boots, and I don't trip on carpet or other surface disruptions. I can put on some mileage with this pair! The Velcro straps easily adjust for my normal foot and swollen foot. It's all good. Time to buy another color, because the first pair, bought in 2008, is by no means worn out or broken. Add to my cart, Amazon!"
214883,1,"I got the red/white/green ones for my birthday and almost cried. They are the best shoes made on the planet, and the fact that they are even offered in Italy colors makes them that more fantastic."
188921,1,"This is my fourth pair of these, the most comforetable shoe i have eveer worn. They arrived on time, in the origianl box, fit perfectly and fell like a glove on my foot."
343734,1,I couldn't purchase these anyplace in town and as usual you had them available for me! I got them in record time and ready to send off for a christmas gift.
94947,1,"After placing my order for these shoues, they arrived very soon.They're comfortable (and ideal for me because I have diabetes; the velcro allows you to adjust the tightness of the shoes). Great traction on the bottom. Very nice looking. They appear to be well constructed and should last many years."
59809,1,GREAT SHOE. THE LEATHER IS REALLY SOFT AND THE SALE PRICE WAS WONDERFUL. A REALLY GOOD DEAL.
168102,1,"As a nursing student I'm required to wear white shoes for clinicals. Trying to find plain white shoes in a 4E width was nearly impossible. I looked for weeks locally in stores, only to be confronted with certain brands that cost over $125! The Propet shoes not only fit my foot, but fit my budget at half the cost of the shoe store. Very comfortable and they look good, too."
183327,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
266761,1,"was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
150299,1,My 2/3 year old loves these!Versatile and can be casual or when we put khakis on him.Hold up well as compared to shoes from big box store with a red target for a logo.Would buy again.
263485,1,Had to rate this because of the great price!!! Shoes were in perfect condition order was processed fast and professional. Will definitely shop again.
324916,1,"I wasn't real comfortable with spending this much on a slipper the first time I bought a pair of these but, I have to admit, these are the most comfortable, warm, flexible, and durable slippers I have ever owned. Just bought my husband his second pair and, I have no doubt, will buy another pair when those wear out.They don't have a hard sole but they are thick enough to protect your foot from goat-heads and all of the other nasty stickers that we get out here.We bought the first pair in a store. I was worried about the sizing of these. My husband wears a solid size 14. He put these on and they are snug, but they fit. If they are like the old ones, they will pack down and stretch a little and conform to his foot before long.If you like to wear slippers and are looking for a pair that will serve you in comfort and durability, this is a good buy."
99135,1,You've seen these shoes everywhere...right? Well theres a reason for it! They are SO comfortable and virtually go with ANY outfit! I love them and wear them everyday! :) BUY THESE SHOES and you won't regret it (unless YOU order the wrong size!)
351555,0,"go up one full size for a better fit. shoe is cute, with heel about 2 inches or more."
313908,1,"I have just received and opened these timberland (medium) boots. They are my third pair of &#34;Tims,&#34; beautiful and a perfect fit. For women who love black boots with jeans or even with jean shorts (summer will be here soon enough!), these are a must. When I submitted my order I was a little worried about some reviews that stated the medium size was too narrow. Well, after putting these boots on and showing them off to my husband, I find them to be perfect. Also, for those with a slightly larger foot (like me!), I was pleased to find these boots give both a slimming and smaller effect. Either way, if you are a woman who likes the comfort and security of wearing a boot with your jeans during your off dress days, then this boot is for you. Lastly, shipping time and packaging was great. Leather around the ankle is a little stiff, but as all leather goes, I am sure it will relax after a couple of wears. Do not pass this up. Go Timberland."
39065,1,"I am not sure why, but these particular shoes are getting rather difficult to find in retail stores in our area. I am on my feet a lot at work and do a lot of walking. For the price, these are probably the most comfortable and long lasting shoe I have ever worn. I have several pair of them because when I do find them, I buy two pair at a time.I must admit to being rather rough on shoes but these things hold up just as well as shoes that I have paid four and five times more for.These shoes give you plenty of toes room and the cushioning is wonderful. I tend to land rather hard on my heels when I walk and the cushion in these shoes is perfect.Of course as the shoes become a bit worn for the work place, they go into my outdoor walking and scrounging around shoe pile; they work wonderfully for that purpose also. The sole is quite even and stable which helps prevent ankle strain or sprain when moving over rough ground. I have one old pair; really, really old and beat-up, which I use for my creek wading. Of course it does take awhile to wear a pair of these out and they clean up quite well using only a damp cloth and a brushing now and then.For the price it is really rather difficult to beat these things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
132956,1,These boots are just as beautiful in person as they are in the picture. And they are SO comfortable. I would definitely recommend them!
144616,1,The only thing I can say is that she waited four years for a pair of Uggs and she loves them and it was worth the wait.
26696,1,"I bought this shoe because I used to wear them for dancing, I do not dance any more but wanted the comfort and support these shoes provide. Great cushion on the innersole."
80193,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
372331,1,"These slippers are my favorite because they are comfortable, can be worn all wear long, light so easy to pack so Ican enjoy wearing them at my destination, and never out of style."
176013,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
215049,1,"I received my Sorel boots just in time to attend the inauguration. I knew that the weather was cold, and felt that I needed a real substantial boots to keep my feet warm. While searching for boots in a shoe store, another customer said, ""Try to get Sorel boots and your feet will never get cold."" After going on line, I saw the boots I liked at the right price, on Amazon.The boots arrived a few days before I was to leave for the Inauguration of our 44th President. I immediately put them on. They were much more comfortable then I expected.When I left California, I had them on, and spent 10 hours in them before finally, getting to the hotel in Baltimore. After only five hours, I put them back on, for the train ride into the D.C. area. Then walked about 5 miles, and stood in bone chilling cold, with a wind factor of five degrees, for 3 and a half hours, waiting for the Inauguration to start. Following the ceremony, I walked about 7 more miles until I was able to rest in a church. All the time, my feet were warm, comfortable and never got cold, thanks to my boots!!"
162211,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
251254,0,"Straps need more holes to tighten, and I find it difficult to make new ones, so to the shoe repair shop."
115390,1,These are like a sneaker/tennis shoe hybrid. The soles are thick and the material is lightweight. I have bad knees so I was looking for something stylish and comfortable to wear at work and these fit the bill perfectly!
21966,1,"My husband has always been a fan for the Sketchers Critics. He loves the fit and the fact it can go with almost anything. The price was the best price I have seen from any website, or store. I will definitely continue to buy his shoes through this website."
4123,1,"i was hiking last sunday on the north east side of barbados, they protected my feet when i stepped the sea rocks along the shoreline.i used wear shoes and my feet are not longer wet i walked thru wet grass or i stepped into water.they are comfortable. i dont have worry about twristing my ankles no more or hurting my feet on jagged rocks.one hiking buddies stated that i must have on goat parts because he said, i was going very fast along the shoreline, sometime there was very little space for footing. i was going buy an other brand but when i saw them online, i wanted them! they are grrreeeaat!them light weight. before i bought the boots, i used wear a pair of running shoes and the rain comes or falls the night before! my feet would wet and will bring alot of discomforts to my feet but alas i have my htmaivwp hiking boots. they are great."
142692,1,"Very comfortable, but do require a little breaking in period, as they rub on my little toe. This is my third pair of Clark's this year, same problem. Otherwise, very nice and fashionable. Nice to find dressy, fun shoes in larger shoe size. No more boring and bland with the Clark's styles. The Melanzane color looked more brown on the computer, they are actually purply-reddish color, decided to keep them just for something different. Will definately buy more Clark's in the future. Fit is true to size, a little snug across the arch, particularly if you have a high arch."
86992,1,Bought these shoes for my wedding rehersal and they were comfortable. I have since wore them often and never a problem. Love them!
374159,1,"I have had these for two years now and they are in great shape! Clarks is a very good name, the comfort is wonderful. The inner sole comes out for easy washing too! Great slip on!"
300132,1,I have been looking for replacemnt backless leather skuffs for 7 years. These Israeli sourced shoes are superbly made and the service from the Clog Shop was first rate. And wow are they comfortable! A little pricey but worth it.
43961,0,"The product is really cool looking, and was something I was comfortable wearing not only in the water, but walking around. The best part is, they kept me from getting reef rash in Jamaica!!! It was really hard washing sand off the inside of the shoe, however, and the back of it dug into the back of my ankle and took a huge chunk out of my skin. Maybe you'll have better luck?"
319964,0,"I bought these for myself needing a full sole shoe rather quickly. I am an adult who bought 8m considering that is my street size. My feet to be average with occassional slippage in heel area. For that I did expect to have minimal fit problems but the heel strap & sides are way too big. The sides particularly gap which makes it annoying/unsightly. I would recommend bloch's danshoz over these in my opinion. Such a shame too, these are cute."
165223,1,"We have many different pairs and styles of Uggs in our house. They are the warmest, most comfortable boots and slippers ever. I bought this pair here at Amazon through Shoes.com, they are an Authorized Seller of Uggs. You have to be careful with buying them online because so many places are not authorzed to sell them and sell fakes. Even some of the sellers listed up there on this page are not Authorized Sellers.Anyway, the boots themselves are great. They fit so well. You do need to buy a size smaller than usual, as they do run big. They conform toy uor foot and feel amazing. You can save a few bucks by buying children's sizes as well. In that case you would order 2 sizes smaller - if you wear a 6 in women's you can buy a 4 in kids.These boots are very well made and last a long time. They keep your feet toasty warm and are surprisingly easy to clean."
170774,1,Over the past 10 years have purchased half a dozen various styles of Minnetonka moccasins and this one is like a second skin and love the look.
357244,1,"Wonderful product, great quality! I just can't say enough about how much we love them! If you are on the fence about getting these, do it, you will not be disappointed!"
133118,2,"I've been wearing and loving Rainbow sandals for well over 15 years...I can walk miles in them comfortably. These that I ordered surprised me as one sole was longer than the other! I had to return them, needless to say."
382572,1,"I got these Friday morning (July 27th) just before we took off for the San Diego Safari Park. I was a little nervous since most new shoes (especially flops) give me blisters for the first little bit, but I wore them for four hours walking all through the park and not only were my feet far less sore than any other part of my legs, I didn't have any blisters at all. Really cute, really comfy, and thick enough that I know they're going to last for a while."
76160,2,"Nice looking shoes, but the ones I received are way too small. They say size 7.5N, but definitely are not. I will have to return them."
3331,1,"I bought these boots to replace my three year old boots that I had bought to replace my summer weight non waterproof boots that I still have and use if I know water won't be involved. All the boots I have bought in the last 5 years have been Hi-Tec. They fit and feel like a sneaker once you get them broken in. I am in the process of breaking these new ones in, it has only been two days so they are still a little stiff. I figure that by next week I will be good to go in these. I use these for work, daily wear, hiking, walking, walking in rain, steeping in streams, walking in snow, mowing the lawn, using the snowblower, snowshoeing, and they work great with my yak-trax when I walk on ice. The only reason I replaced my old ones is because they were starting to leak water when I submerged them for more than a few seconds. Great boots, I don't regret any pair of Hi-Hec's I ever bought.1/23/12 UPDATE! I am now on pair number 4 of these boots and I will say that while these are every bit as good at protecting my foot as every pair of Hi-Tec boots I have owned there was a down side this time. It has taken over two weeks of daily wear to get these broken in, and they still need a little more work. Mostly they are tight in the ankle area but softening. I really like the boots, but over two weeks to break in is a little much."
136448,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for most of my life. They aren't $15. anymore, but they are still worth the money. They are very flat, so don't forget to get some insoles with arches for them! You may want to add 1/2 a shoe size for this."
149030,2,These shoes run much smaller than Clark's. I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I couldn't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days.
347416,1,they are so confortable and so cool and nice too wear.i love them and i would buy 10 more if i could.
372692,1,I was so happy with this purchase. I purchased this just days before Christmas. These came on time and were exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the great service.
190142,1,"Thank you K-Swiss for making this shoe for decades. I remember wanting a pair in the 1970's and now my kids are wearing them. My children's school has a dress code with all white tennis shoes, which are hard to find. In addition, I have tried to buy cheaper shoes and have ended up replacing them every 1-2 weeks - I'm not sure how my kids destroy them but it's downright frightening to my wallet. So I invested in the K-Swiss and have not been sorry. I literally bought 7 pairs of other shoes between September and December, then bought the K-Swiss and they lasted for over a year until my daughter grew out of them. I do recommend printing out the size chart and making sure you get the right size."
349652,1,"My wife says it's a very comfortable shoe but a bad color, and she asked why they don't make it in classic white. She also asked why Reebok doesn't make more women's shoes in a size 10.5, which is large enough to accommodate her orthotics as well as socks. Reebok has been her favorite manufacturer for years and she's sorry to have to start buying from others now that she has to buy a larger size than in the past. All in all, however, she says they fit very well, are light enough and are a great product for a very reasonable price."
311007,1,My husband just loves these shoes for comfort and support. They wear well and we are a return customer for this same item!
363183,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
53375,0,"These shoes are very comfortable, but not stylish at all. They are good for running out to the grocery store or CVS, but I would not wear them for going out with friends. Definitely not a dinner companion."
246777,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
31442,1,I love crocs. My 2.5 yr old can put them on himself and that helps.
223596,1,My son threw them on as soon as they came. They were quality and he got a size smaller than he regularly wears ( thanks to the advice from prior reviews) and they were perfect.
303429,1,"I've gone through quite a few shoes through the years but these are the best. In fact I also own the mountain bike version for off roading. The system is perfect for getting in and out of quickly. The comfort is superb. The first time(not recommended I suppose) I wore mine I did a fifty mile fun ride from Rosarito to Ensenada in Baja California without the slightest problem. I didn't even have to break them in! When you get around other bikers (not the motor type)you'll see that these are the shoes of choice as many people will be sporting them, and with good reason. They are super comfortable for walking in for short periods when off the bike for whatever reason. The rubber heal eliminates the annoying clack-clack sound that draws attention and sounds like you are walking in your wifes high healed shoes.The carbon material in the soles transfers the power effortlessly. You will feel no fatigue after hours in the saddle with these puppies underneath your dogs."
158981,1,this item i had ordered was for my teenage son it was one of the few places i was able to find this on line he was happy i was happy the order was quickly filled 5 stars thank you amazonsincerly bethConverse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Black Canvas
70813,1,"I would rate the quality of this sandal excellent, but would have preferred a wider width, which NB is known for, than what I received. Maybe after I wear the sandals for a period of time they will widen out."
228454,1,"I felt that my karma would be bad if I didn't take a moment to describe my experience in dealing with GrandSlamNY. I purchased a pair of Converse All Star's for my girlfriend for Christmas. I got the size she asked for (even took into account the additional information supplied on the site about how the size of this particular shoe runs about a size big. When they arrived they were too big! I THEN checked the return policy and saw that the period had expired (I partied hard during the holidays and the shoes were returned close to 4 weeks after purchase. I sent an email to the owner of the store and he told me to send them back for exchange. I did so and received the new pair 4 days after mailing the incorrect pair back to him. I will do business with them again because, on top of everything, for the size I needed, GrandSlam had the lowest price. Good lookin, David."
98003,1,I bought these pink beach crocs for my wife for Christmas. When she first saw them she didin't know if she liked them but after wearing them once she now love's them. Great shoes at a reasonable price. I wound up buying a beige pair for myself. They arrived quickly and matched the online photo and description.
387030,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
5600,1,"The woodlore has only a length customized fit but does have a nice wide heel. Not a bad shoe tree for $20 but there are better out there, such as Allen Edmonds."
333055,0,"I bought them 1/2 a size larger than normal and they fit fine. They will be good pair of boots to get dirty without feeling bad, how can you go wrong for $19.79."
291739,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
89883,1,"Honestly, I've been wearing these shoes since I was 16. I'm now 23 and refuse to wear anything else. I tend to go through a pair a year (Ohio winters are harsh on shoes) and have 5-6 pairs in my closet just in case Eastland decides to stop making this style.The absolute most comfortable, most durable shoe I've ever come across. If told to choose between these shoes and my mother....I'd have a REALLY hard time picking."
191531,2,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
86962,1,I have purchased six pairs of these wonderfully comfortable shoes that can be worn with many different types of outfits.
265018,1,I had bought a pair of these before at another retail store and they fit great. These are great fitting boots. I would recommend these to others.
358764,1,"These are really nice shoes. They are holding up wonderfully. As the other reviewer shared, I, too, found them a little difficult to break in; however, well worth the price for durability."
152872,1,"These boots are definitley authentic. I don't know why people are saying they are fake because they're made in China. They are supposed to be made in china. The only way you're going to get ones made in Australia is if you LIVE in Austraila. Great boots, yes they are real. Took a little while to get here but otherwise its great."
363856,1,"I am on my third pair of converse, and I LOVE it to bits. They're reliable (My first pair lasted 2 years, i was reluctant to buy another since it broke in), last forever (you know, 2 years is a lot considering the other cheap China made crappy shoes), and when you break them in, they're heaven to your feet. One thing though, if you are going to use it for exercising, bad idea. Some Dr.Scholl's slip-ins might make it more bearable. Overall, comfort 8/10 and style 10/10. Customizable 10/10. Great buy!"
199430,0,"I've worn these type shoes forever, getting a new pair when they are literally worn through. For the punishment they stand up to, the price is appropriate. So, this time I decided to order from Amazon again since the last pair several years ago was perfect.This time, not so perfect. The right inner sole lining was loose in the toe. Thought it might stick itself down with a couple of wearings but now it's loose half way down. Am in the process of having this warranty claim adjusted and will update with the results."
155510,1,"LAST CHRISTMAS I ORDERED THIS BOOT AND NOW THIS YEAR THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED. I AM WISHING THAT I HAD ORDERED MORE THAN ONE PAIR. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER PAIR THIS YEAR. I LIKE THE SOLES AND HEELS ON THIS BOOT BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER THAN MOST AND THIS IS THE FINEST LOOKING DRESS BOOT MADE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IT IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT THAT I HAVE FOUND. YOU WILL GET SOME RESPECT WHEN YOU ARE SEEN IN THESE BOOTS. THESE BOOTS ARE ""BOSS"" TO SAY THE LEAST."
69743,1,"I run marathons and various triathlon distances, and have done plenty of miles happily on Asics Kayanos. I was worried about the cushioning on such a lightweight shoe when I took them out of the box. But they run beautifully. They are so incredibly light it makes a noticeable difference to my running. Not sure how long they would last given their minimalist design, but I guess we tend to retire our shoes before there are any signs of wear & tear on the upper part of the shoe anyway. The only issue for me is the tongue design - yes the single-fold makes sense in a weight-saving capacity, and once the shoes are on there are no comfort issues (on the contrary they feel great), but if you do triathlons and need to do a fast transition, you need to spend a bit longer to make sure they are put on right. Nevertheless, they are still my new favorite running shoe. JK"
67265,0,"This shoe was so cute. I heard it ran big so I ordered a size 5 1/2 instead of 6. Unfortunately, they were still huge! Keds used to run TTS but, unfortunately, this seems not to be the case anymore. Too bad, because they are so cute."
215944,1,"I have never bought boots online before because I usually have to try on everything!!! My feet are wide and many boots are uncomfortable. These boots are perfect!! I ordered one half size smaller than usual and they are soooooo comfy!!! Today someone else complimented me on these boots. It seems every place I wear these I get a compliment, where did I get them etc. Very Happy!! I was going to buy another color but I noticed the price is $15 more than it was one month ago (on the black)BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO."
22833,1,"So cute, true to size,they were very affordable and really looked nicer than I expected,good quality for price.Definitely recommend"
375528,1,"My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size.If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a betterfit. I also search the web for additional consumer reviews.PROS:This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!It's an easy to put on short boot.(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.Stains will wipe right off.I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for youngprofessionals to wear with their slacks.Relatively comfortable. I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.CONS:Leather IS stiff. Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.The zipper is not the best quality.Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!* Or, you can always buy, try on and return.If you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item,you just have to go to the Returns section of the website andgenerate a return label.

355908,1,I love these shoes. This is the second pair of Clark's shoes I've bought from you in the last 3 months.
206257,1,"They look adorable on my toddler. The sizing can be tricky, they run 4/5, 6/7, and so on. They're easy to put on and comfy too! My son likes the bright color of his crocs, we got the royal blue."
308825,2,"I don't know if it is the shoe or my foot, but I am finding them too large at the heels so they slip there causing irritation when I am walking/jogging on the treadmill. I would not buy this style again."
261396,1,Finding Clarks shoes for 30 is unheard of. They are comfortable as Clarks are known to be.
273054,1,These are some of the coolest converse you can buy in my opinion. All black leather....awesome. And they go with everything. They're also a lot more durable than regular converse shoes.
64823,0,I had these same sneakers in the past and same size etc and they fit well. These hurt my feet after a little while so I haven't worn them in a while. I know I cant return them as I wore them for an hour out in the yard so they are a little dirty. I just think they aren't made the same as they were about 10 years ago.
167615,0,I have numerous pairs of these flip flops which I have loved until this recent purchase. I was very disappointed as the straps were too wide compared with my previous purchases which resulted in foot strain.
67333,0,I really like the color. It is a really pretty shoe. My only problem is that it feels so narrow. I bought a wide shoe. And the shoe tongue is very stuff as other reviewers said. Wish they fit better because i love the color.
177061,1,"I wear these shoes daily and they are amazingly comfortable. The insoles wick sweat nicely, but once they do, you can guarantee a smelly foot. Instead of spending money to replace the entire shoe, invest in a pair of Ecco Replacement insoles and your shoes will be with you for month to come. I bought a pair in every color!"
102034,1,"the product is excellent, I'm very happy because my son got his new shoes and height was just tailor, was delighted with them proximante purchase more through this route."
123183,1,Good walking shoes n. work shoes if u do a lot of walking on the job n comfortable on your feet
311543,0,"This shoe was very tight when first worn. It has stretched a bit as I have worn it, but I would have returned it immediately if the next size up had been available. I had purchased the previous year's version of this shoe which was snug initially and stretched quickly as wornto become an extremely comfortable shoe. I have high hopes for this model as I continue to wear it for short spans hoping to stretch it and have it conform to the same comfortable style as the previous shoe I purchased."
369495,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
283111,1,"I cannot begin to describe how comfortable and warm these slippers are! I will never buy another brand. And they are completely machine wash and dry-able, which makes them even better. I'm going to buy a bunch for my family for xmas this year!"
292464,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
172585,1,"I like that are very beautiful and above all with an affordable price, I made good buy, hope to find products with similar characteristics"
181386,1,I shopped everywhere for a men's size 7 for my 13 year old grandson and I was even told they didn't make it. I'm glad I tried online. These are perfect and a great price with free shipping.
273904,1,Sorry I didn't know where to ask because it doesn't specify how the shoes are made. But are they leather!??? Or not? Please let me know asap since I am interested in buying them. Thanks.
62742,1,I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more! Thrilled to pieces!
354342,1,"I bought this shoe earlier today because of all of the reviews I read about how great this shoe is.My routine is about 2-3 miles on treadmill before I start my lift, so I wanted something that was comfortable and durable yet light weight. My last pair of shoes I bought Summer of 2006, which were New balance 473. I loved them very much, but I am a large guy and wore the shoe out. For the last week or so, I had been having horrible pains in my legs which I found out were shin splints. I am more of a lifter than a runner/jogger/walker, and i haven't ever had that sensation before, so it scared me. I decided to go to a local shop and the guy said i just need to replace my shoes, which is why I got these adidas. I did about 2 miles, and to be honest the sensation was weird. The 'bounce' is very evident. However, this is not a bad feeling. On the contrary, it is very comfortable.I imagine after I break them in a bit more, they will be even better. Ill update in a few weeks after I put some miles on them."
371782,1,"I use these boots for law enforcement training and they hold up very well. They have great support and feel lightweight, almost like running shoes. The added side-zipper is a nice feature and the side pocket is great for holding an extra handcuff key or even extra cash. I've had these boots for a couple weeks now and they've been a good investment!"
319583,1,"A happy manThe first day of wearing the hush puppies I found them a bit stiff,I Thought oh no I have scuffed the soles and now I am committedTo the ownership of these shoes . However from the second dayon they are proofing to be exactly what I expected from this brandof (hush puppy) shoe. Again I am a happy man"
354953,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
261726,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
366567,1,My 94 year old Mother loves them as a replacement for her old ones of different brand. Glad she is happy again.
92746,1,"bottom line: this is not a car jack. you can't apply hundreds of pounds of force and not expect it to break.remember you are stretching shoes. this is a process that takes some time.once you start to feel resistance while expanding, apply some medium proof isopropyl alcohol (after making sure the leather or fabric is color safe) to moisten and soften the leather/canvas/etc. give it one more turn, and then put the shoes down and leave them alone for a few hours. you can reapply the alcohol as much as you want--it'll evaporate quickly, but it will penetrate the material and help it relax.after a few hours have gone by, you can repeat the process.much like jacking the foundation of a house, making small changes and being patient is the key to success.my wife's feet have thanked me a dozen times already, and the stretchers are holding up perfectly well."
48149,1,"I LOVE Crocs. I have many pairs, sandals, regular crocs and lined crocs. If these were NOT purple I would send them back. REFLEXOLOGY, some folk swear by it. me, having 'bumps' in my shoes just feels like I have rocks or sand in my shoes and to me it is ultimately annoying. I cannot wear these WITHOUT socks which in summer sort of defeats the purpose. That explains the 4 stars, if there were no 'bumps' inside it would be a 5 star.If YOU swear by REFLEXOLOGY and LIKE 'bumps' in the soles of your shoes great, but if you DON'T (like me) be forewarned...they are there and there are a LOT of them not just a few and they seem to be all over the inner sole and all the same size which I didn't think was the way reflexology worked...but hey, I'm just a retired RN so what do I know about reflexology??!BTW, the purple part, lovely color and usually if it's purple I'll buy it and if it's purple I usually forgive any flaws, the exception being a purple umbrella that would not open LOL."
197544,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
58050,1,"The size fits perfectly, the color is exactly like the picture, and above all it's super super cute.Makes me want to purchase another color!"
293122,1,These are great sneakers for day to day walking around. They are comfortable as soon as you put them on and hold up pretty well to regular use. I wear them a few days a week and my first pair lasted almost 2 years before they became less comfortable. They look great with jeans and I often get compliments on them. I've had them in gray/olive and now in navy/silver. I'm a size 11 and love that these fit and are affordable. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the arch support could be better. I will totally buy these again!
350899,0,I tried these on at the local Sports Chalet and really liked the comfort however the price was quite high. Found these on Amazon for about $30 cheaper so I decided to give them a go. I ordered the same size that felt great in the store but the ones I ordered online seem to have a different feel. My heels were almost raw from rubbing inside the shoe after a couple of hikes. I figured maybe I just needed to break them in. They did get better after a few weeks but not as comfortable as I would have hoped for the price. There are probably some better choices out there at more reasonable prices.
293922,0,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
57270,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
25527,1,"I have worn the Adidas Supertar 2G shoe for working-out and walking (never for playing Basketball) for over 20 years. When this pair wears out, I'll be hard pressed to find a suitable replacement. Excellent form, fit and function. Too bad it has been discontinued!"
114235,1,"This is a great ballet shoe, however I found the shoe to fit a little big. I had a nine for my three year old that were getting very snug, and thought that I'd be safe with a size 10, but a 9.5 would have been a much better fit."
337348,0,"Just purchased my second set of these boots. I love them, but this pair has the same issue as the first pair. I wear a wide size. The left boot is more narrow than the right. I don't have this issue with any other set of boots so it's not that my left foot is wider than my right. It takes a month or two to stretch out depending on how much you wear them. It's very annoying until then. I've have a friend at work that wears these same boots as well, and he has the same issue. They will widen out but it's a big pain until they do."
309186,1,"A great shoe. Doesn't show off a lot. Really comfortable, and never out of style"
76122,1,"These are wonderful boots...They are especially great if you have muscular calves and normally can't fit into cute knee-high boots because they lace up and zip up the side, so you can adjust the lacing to fit your leg.The boots are gorgeous (I got the Patent ones) and they are comfortable for what they are. The heel is chunky enough to make them easy to walk in too. I definitely reccommend them to anyone looking for cute, comfy fetish booths that fit a range of calves."
184163,1,"I love these mocs. They're so comfy, almost like wearing slippers. The only thing you need to be aware of is sizing. I am usually a size 9 and ordered a half size down 8.5 after reading reviews. The 8.5 was still way to big. I advise to go with 1 whole size down."
340747,1,"I love converse SO much. i wore my old ones until they had holes in them and were falling apart. i just got these and of course I LOVE THEM. they are 100% REAL AUTHENTIC converse. the shipping was extremely fast, and very safely packaged :) thank you so much"
299362,0,"I *love* the squishy-soft footbed for work on concrete and tile floors. But the Beach Clog allows my orthotics to roll over (outside of ankles roll under), creating ankle pain. I have fixed the problem somewhat by adding thick self-stick window insulation foam on the outside edges of the inside of the Crocs footbeds. So long as the insulation doesn't migrate, it works, sort of acceptably.I cannot wear my Crocs without orthotics because their arch support is simply not high enough. I haven't tried Crocs Relief clogs, but for we supinators with orthotics, Beach Clogs aren't what they could be.Update as of May, 2009: I CAN wear Crocs without orthotics! Necessary because window tapes kept shifting out of place. I had to try it for a couple of days to get the feel and to keep my left ankle, the roll-under one, upright (I tripped a lot while concentrating on feets and not walkways). But I can wear them sans arch supports, even out on walks for a hour or more. The only catch has been when my two labs pulled hard, and I had to shuffle loose Crocs (backstrap up -- oops!) to keep up. Lab training is not the responsibility of the Crocs people!"
184371,1,the grey moccasin fits good and looks good. feels sturdy on my foot would recommend for a narrow sized foot
320740,1,These are a replacement gift for our grandson who got the same pair last year (in a smaller size) and wore them out. He will get them on Christmas day so the real review will be from him.
325247,1,"Very comfortable, no breaking in period. Slightly too big, but a new inner sole took up the extra space. This is my second pair. The first pair lasted 6 years. I'm female, normally wear 7.5 wide in women's, but I couldn't find any women's cleats that fit. These do the job."
189832,0,"These boots are really cute over skinny jeans and look great with babydoll dresses too. They don't look cheap, but are really not expensive. We will see how long they last!"
95333,0,When trying to wear these sandals my foot keeps slipping out and they are as tight as they can be fastened.
202869,1,Keens sandal shoes are great for everything. I already have a pair so we ordered these for my husband. He loves them too. They are not your ordinary men's sandal. They let your foot breath and the sole is made from non absorbent material which is sweat proof. They are good for hiking and water activities as well as everyday wear. Great product all around!
18467,1,"Love this shoe. It's perfect for comfort wearing, looking good or sports. THE PERFECT SHOE, YO!"
7815,2,"Do not buy! The Keds quality has become garbage! Much narrower, cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price!! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart. Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end."
72220,0,"ordered these for my wife, pretty much what you'd expect for the price. Not bad for fun club wear, but not for every day unless you want to reorder monthly. Sizes do run small, which was a bummer as the shoes were a birthday present that she couldn't wear."
65140,1,I love anything denim. these sneakers are great with jeans. They feel a little big but not unwearable. thanks
96739,1,This is my 3rd pair in 24 years. That's a fine testimony to their durability. Matterhorn makes great boots IMHO.
377633,1,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat.I received 2 pairs of nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat White.when requesting the colour on the order form, you have 2 options for wheat. The option for Wheat White is not separate from regular wheat.I am now stuck with 2 pairs of the wrong colour. I live in Ireland and therefore would be very expensive for me to send them back to you.I am very dissapointed with my purchases. Unless you can rectify the situation for me I will not be recommending your service to family and friends.Thanking youRachel Costello"
332226,1,Bought it for my daughter who plays rugby. She was very happy with it and was able to play confortably
326367,0,"I bought these boots as part of a costume. I'm a little bigger than some girls, but no where near bigger than most, so I bought a size up to make sure the calves fit. When they arrived, however, they didn't fit AT ALL. Luckily, since the sole was the right size, I was able to take time and stretch the top of the boot, being vinyl, so it's all good, but if you don't have the time or patience to stretch vinyl, you may want to reconsider.The color and shine were exactly as pictured for me, the heel is a comfortable height and width. Basically, except for the (fixable) sizing issue with the top, the boot is excellent, and a very fair price for the quality."
251218,1,"We were in Orlando for 3 weeks vacation and looked everywhere for a pair of Birkenstock sandals. Only found 2 stores that had them in stock, both were the plain brown colour. Went online and Amazon had them in different colours and the best price."
240507,1,"Product arrived quickly, with great packaging. The color was exactly as pictured. The fit is execellent with more arch support than I expected. The shoes appear to be well made without any visible defects. I will probably order a second pair in another color as I am very pleased with these. They are just what I was looking for."
65203,1,Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe..
88221,1,"We all wear crocs in our family. We just throw them on and out the door we go. What more can you say. This is one of the simplest versions with a good roomy fit (you'll see that some Crocs have a single digit size as in ""size 8"" and others have a size span as in ""size 8-9"") For the kids in the family we always get the ones with the size range as those tend to get the longest wear. And if you go to the Crocs website you can learn how you can recycle your used Crocs (however us adults have been wearing ours for two years already with no wear in sight)"
76771,1,"These were probably about my 15th or 20th pair of Capezios, but they were my first t-straps and my first online shoe purchase. I was a little worried that the leather on the toe box would be soft and prone to wrinkling like their Footlights but not at all. The leather is smooth and firm. They are true to Capezio's sizing, so if you fit a 7 in any other Capizio you'll fit a 7 in these. My high insteps don't affect the line of the shoe at all. The soles are the same as the Footlights, scored across the toe and ball with nailed heels. When these wear out, I will be happily buying another pair. These are my new favorite formal dance shoes."
308093,1,The shoes arrived a bit earlier then they were supposed to which was nice. if you followed the chart for normal converse shoes then the size shouldnt be a problem. they are quite heavy but quite comfy. and the plastic is.... interesting shall i say. id recommend them to people just not friends
347612,1,daughter loves these shoes for school. fast shipment with no issues. will buy again from this seller.
387130,1,"I wear these everyday because they're very comfy. My only warning is to be careful washing them, mine came out of the dryer more grey than pink."
83299,0,"These were nice slippers - but I had to return them due to the size. They came in small, medium, large - but I really wanted the shoe size so I could have made a more informed decision. Other than that, everything great! thanks"
60127,1,"These hi-tec boots are the BEST!!!! I have been getting the same kind for the last 10 years or so and they last for about two years of wearing them to work everyday and also working at home.Dont hesitate getting these!!! I wear a size 14 or 15 and Im also very picky about whats on my feet!! After two years they are still very comfortable and still resist water,I just wear down the tread."
208591,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
366007,1,"Very nice shoes, true to size and nice colour. I got a lot of compliments for them. I strongly recommend them to young people."
349721,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
337846,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
57432,1,Bought these for my daughter to play Tracy in a high school production of Hairspray set in the 60's. Great classic style and fit and perfect for a lot of dancing!
370245,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
140803,1,"I bought these shoes from Nordstrom earlier this year and wore them almost every day. They hurt at first, but once you break in the leather they are extremely comfortable, especially with little socks in them.The sizes run larger in this style for some reason, so I fit into an 8.5 of these, when I normally take a 9, usually a 10 in heels.They look great with jeans, too!the only drawback I found is that the heels are covered in leather, so when I went to New Mexico for a working vacation, they got all chewed up in the gravel at a flea market (I didnt know the flea market had a gravel ground, i thought it would be concrete or dirt or ... well. not gravel. grr.) so i ruined the heels on my first pair and had to order replacements from amazon. so if you live somewhere where there is a ton of gravel, i wouldnt buy any fancy leather heeled shoes."
322205,1,These shoes are wonderful. The only thing I had a problem with was finding my size. Turns out my regular shoe size was correct. The exchange was taken care of very well. I got the new shoes the next day and they are beautiful and fit very well.
17559,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
298797,1,"I ordered two pairs of crocs, one in navy and one in black. size m4-5 w6-7. The black one which was made in mexico fit but the navy one made in china was to small. Was about 3/4 smaller than the ones made in mexico. This is my second pair and my son and I love them. Wish I knew before ordering who the manufacturer was."
164174,1,"I bought a pair of Merrell Men's Moab Ventilator Mids back in August of 2011. I pulled them out of the box, and almost immediately wore them on an 8mi day-hike in the Sawtooths, carrying around 30-35lbs. Not a single blister--not even a hot spot! Since then, I've worn during regular fast hikes (usually hike at a 15:00min/mil pace with 40-60lbs). These boots have proved to be excellent! I have terribly weak ankles, but haven't rolled them while wearing these boots. They are nicely cushioned and feel great on my feet. I am looking to buy another pair soon."
112557,1,"I ordered this shoe in black leather with black patent trim. It would have been the perfect dressy flat shoe and I even ordered two sizes to try. Alas, neither fit well enough and both were uncomfortable. Hated having to send them back. I'm still searching for a comparable shoe."
3229,1,"I bought my first pair of Altitude IV's in late 2007. I have worn them nearly every day and they will keep you dry in the Heaviest Morning Dew; they have held up better than any throw-away pair of High Top Sneakers. I still use them and was considering another pair. My original pair from here was $42. Why have they nearly doubled to $76.43 in 3 years?!? Even through a marketplace seller, I'll pay half again what I gave before. They raised the price another $10 just this week to the current price.Hi-Tec certainly delivers a quality product and I understand some increase with time, but a quick Froogle Search reveals that you can find them cheaper elsewhere."
360773,0,"I ordered a half-size larger, in response to reviews here, and that was good advice. But alas, one shoe was larger than the other, even though marked the same size. Amazon, as always, was great about the return. Apart from that, it's a fun shoe at a good price."
157693,1,"What else can I say? Converse's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades. They are comfortable, fun and in my case, red. I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own. Love them."
98652,1,These clogs are so comfortable. I work in a cooking school and this is the first time I can remember coming home without aching feet. Thank you Quark!
201947,0,"Boots seem well made. Size seems to run small so suggest buying a size and width larger than you normally wear, maybe even 1 1/2 size larger. Feels like it will take some time to break in as they are quite stiff. Boot laces that come with boots are at least 6 inches too short; Cannot lace all the way up with original laces. Will leave more feedback after I wear these awhile. Feel like they will keep feet warm in extreme cold.Later comment.Contacted manufacturer about the laces being too short. They replied that they had never been informed about it and did not have any lengths of laces other than 72 inches or 108 inches and that the 108 would be too long. (Too long would be better than too short-could always cut them off but it is really hard to stretch the short ones.) What surprises me more is that it is very obvious that the manufacturer never tried on the boots and laced them up to test them. Research on-line confirms that other purchasers of Chippewa 9 inch boots also commented about the laces being too short. Does cause some concern about the quality control testing of the company's products and their willingness to listen to customer feedback."
24900,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
320871,0,"Size run's a little big, but we were able to put up with it in regardless. So we kept them."
5055,1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quick with no hassles. Beats gas, time and crowds that are experienced when going to a brick and mortar store."
388459,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
90668,1,"Because they were synthetic, I had to get rid of these boots from simple inside wear and tear after about 3 glorious years of these being the coolest, hippest, funnest boots I've ever worn. If they came back in stock I'd buy three pair all at once for long term wear!"
226770,1,Shoes are Great! When you buy make your order for a smaller size. I ordered size 11 and they are plenty long enough. You should order at least 1/2 size smaller. Overall shoes are just like you'd expect from Converse.
342706,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
384651,1,I love these shoes! Very classy and unlike any other patent leather heels I have seen before. Perfect color and beautiful heel that's translucent.
176482,1,"When I First Wore it,It Felt Like It Was Weightless!It Was so comfortable that i bought a few more pairs....."
307029,1,"A comfortable boot for having a slight heel. I don't wear heels, and these (though low) are about as comfortable as heels can be. Makes them a bit dressy without being uncomfortably high. Boots are very stylish and go well w/ skirts, pants or jeans. There is some padding in the shaft of the boot which is nice. I've had other boots without that and as the boot creases it dents into my shins/ankles. These are more comfortable. I have a very small calf and they are slightly roomy - leaving room for jeans to be tucked in if I wanted to, but not too wide to be floppy without tucking. The footbed is pretty well padded, but I would have given it 5 stars for just a little more padding. All in all seem to be well made and comfortable."
194060,2,I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago. The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small. I sent them back and got a refund.
75432,1,"Cheap shoes, doesnt look cheap at all, fun snickers well made, confortable. Wont regreat if you decide buying this pair. Good look"
23270,1,"Every spring, I bought flip-flops. After a while, they squished down, and my back would start to hurt. I asked myself, why are there not good quality sandles on the market? Well, I asked around and got good comments on Reef sandles, so I took the plunge, spent the extra money, and I am so happy now. I'm embarrassed to say that I weigh close to 400 pounds. Long story, etc... but, after 4 months of use, these Reef sandles look like new! I expect to get at least 2 years out of them. Hey, spend $5 on flip flops and throw them out in September. Or buy quality and enjoy them for years. The bottle opener has come in handy too!"
59647,1,"At half a century old, I've been camping for as long as I can remember. When I had to start buying my own boots, I went cheap to save money. I got exactly what I paid for! Now don't get me wrong, if you need reliable foot protection to go caving one weekend, K-Mart and WalMart offer excellent choices. Personally, I would rather drop $70 on a great pair of boots and wear them 2 years than spend $30 every 6 months.I've owned 3 pair of Timberlands. The first shrunk too small while drying next to the fire. My bad. The bottom of the 2nd pair, in my opinion, wore out prematurely. It wasn't until the 3rd that I realized the sole was simply an inferior material. Hello Hi-Tec! I fell in love with my first pair immediately.ProsThere was no break-in period, not even for my EEE wide dogs! I wear them till they fall apart. Then I purchase another. Years later, another. The Altitude IV waterproof hiking boot has great ankle support, it's fairly light weight, definitely waterproof, somehow breathes well even for the aroma my feet produce, the speed laces are absolutely a plus and the soles have a more aggressive pattern than comparable brands. (Did I mention I use mine for caving?)ConsConstruction and durability - absolutely NONE!Availability - I only wished more shoe stores carried them so prices would be more competitive. Thank goodness for Amazon.Would I recommend this product?A good pair of boots is an &#34;investment&#34;. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. When I did the math, the only correct answer is Hi-Tec!"
183974,2,"I cannot see if ""made in China"" is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number, but the shoes I bought from Footsmart couldn't cut an 8 hour shift. I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine, but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job, I felt crippled. The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse, the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb. I can't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not. After one wearing, they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe. Now I'm just $100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet. Great. My suggestion is that you buy Dansko's from a company that takes returns in the event it doesn't work out for you. I wish I had."
170394,1,"it was for my younger brother, not for me, but he was extremely happy with it, and he like it so much, very good adidas"
31206,1,"My 6 yead old loves them. They are comfotable, these are the 4th pair I have bought. Glad I decided to!"
205709,1,"These little shoes are just about perfect for a dancer - they give you enough grip against the floor so you don't go sliding, and they make turning a breeze. Highly recommended! Just make sure to order at least 2 sizes down from your normal street shoes as they tend to run large."
135154,1,"I purchased a pair of these shoes a few years ago and due to having another pair, I waited to wear them. At first I though they were too narrow but once I put them on, I fell in love with these shoes. I have had many pair of pinch tassled shoes over the past 30 years and next to the old Hanover brand, these are the best ever. I certainly hope I can get many years out of these as they are not the cheapest on the block but by far the best this shoes wearer has ever had."
314940,1,"I have worn size 7 for as long as I can remember and never had a problem with shoe size. As usual, I bought a size 7. I was surprised by how large it was. Exchanged it for a 6.5, and it is still a little on the large size. So, you may want to choose one size smaller!The shoe itself is very comfortable and presentable enough for travel and daily use.. but not for use in some business office downtown."

303697,1,What an awesome shoes!!! I have been buying the same model of running shoes for three yrs.Highy recommanded
248999,1,I couldnt of been happier. I purchased these shoes 5 years ago and they have lasted me all this time. I wish that I could find another pair
319291,1,Shoes do not fit my feet well but provide great support and wear comfortable. The bottom is a little slippery after several times.
100617,1,"I wear birkenstocks almost exclusively, so I am not unfamiliar with the brand. These were really stiff when I first got them, tho, and took quite a while to break in. Once you get them broken in tho, they are very comfy and they form to your foot. I bought these in B (Medium) width, and I should have gotten narrow. They are a bit wide for me. Birkenstocks run wide and I just made a mistake in ordering. Oh well, they are still some of the most comfortable shoes in my closet."
206210,1,"Bought a pair of cheaper knock offs that gave my 21 month old daughter blisters in a very short time. These shoes are fantastic! They fit perfectly (bought the 6/7 for her, she is a 6.5 in other shoes). I will definately be purchasing more of them. The bright pink looks awesome--better than in the pics."
276385,1,Pretty comfortable from day one. I wish I would have searched the web more. Found them 20 bucks cheaper after purchasing these.
338803,1,my daughter is happy with the purchase. i had order in dec but received wrong size due men size instead of women size. it was my fault . the only complain it was that it took a long time from the time i sent it to get it replaced with correct size. that was my only complain it took a month to get it right. but is a cool sneaker and i did received correct one and my child is happy. yes i would recommend just when ordering make sure you click on the gender size (lol) if not you automactic received in male size.
282862,0,"I had three pairs of Warmbats (2 Kangaroo Classic short and 1 Gecko Grip short) that I ordered back around December 2005. They were wonderful! So comfortable and snug. Felt like walking around in marshmallows! I had a pair of Ugg boots for one day. Send them back the very next day because they weren't nearly as comfy as my Warmbats. I decided to order another pair of Warmbat kangaroo classics this winter. When I got them, they felt different, flimsy. The wool in my previous pairs is much, much thicker and curlier providing a much snugger fit. The wool in the pair I recently received is thin and almost straight. I replaced the removable insole with an Ugg replacement insole and they're MUCH more comfy (which kinda makes me want to give Ugg boots another try). Still not as perfect as my older Warmbats though. I'm giving Warmbat three stars for the way they USED TO fit."
168780,2,"I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit. Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them. So I sent them back hoping that the 7's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for. I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous, especially when you have to spend so much money to get them. I am to young for this problem, with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gonna keep looking."
158269,1,I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes!
9085,1,"LOVE these. Got them in grey with yellow laces- LOVE this color combo. They are true to size, comfy with or without socks (thin socks), and clean very easy. I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean. So glad I got these!"
145415,1,These boots are great for winter cold weather and they wear well. This is the second pair for my daughter--she's worn the others for four years. definite great buy and excellent price.
281887,1,They are a little to wide but otherwise they are great. I get to spread my toes on demi-point. I just hope they do not get to loose. I would recommend it to others.
295902,1,I live down a hill and these are the BEST whenever there is snow or ice on the hill. I walk so much more confidently. They are a lifesaver for me. I would recommend these for anyone who has to go out to walk the dog or just get to the car. They are easy on and easy off and really provide the traction you need.
159267,1,These shoes are a total classic. My son wanted these because they're the same ones David Tenant wears in Dr. Who. Now I need to order another pair because he wears them exclusively. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a stylish and comfortable everyday shoe.
25307,1,"Well, ten dollar shoes. Great price. I love how everyone is complaining about how they are 1 size smaller than what they say.Actually you're WRONG. Asics is a company based in Kobe. If you looked at the seller's size charts, you would have clearly seen the international size chart.So it was more of your error for not selecting the correct size. So please, don't complain about the Flat. These reviews are about the QUALITY of the item...not about how it wasn't what you ordered. They gave you exactly what you wanted.So people, look at the size chart. &lt;3"
312534,1,"These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. Cool and comfortable with a flexible sole and toe coverage so they are not too casual at work. The fit is perfect and they can comfortably be worn all day long. Now I'm on the hunt for a brown pair! I dropped one star from the review because they are showing some minor signs of wear (after perhaps 15-20 days of use) and they may not be highly durable, but it is too early to be sure."
248717,1,Looks just as I thought it would. The sizing is acurate no problems with shipping or anything! I love them. And now I know a great way to purchase shoes without the holiday hassle
137899,1,I really love these shoes. I went out and bought the black pair as well!!
76872,1,"I sing/dance in several amateur theater productions a year. After going through several pairs of lower quality character shoes in the last few years, I decided to spend the money and buy Capezios. Once I began rehearsing in them, I was immediately glad I spent the money. They're worth it!The leather is stiff enough to support but still flexible enough to conform to my foot, & the strap is securely attached and doesn't fray at the end. The elastic attaching the buckle is well attached to the shoe, not something that will soon fray and break. Nothing inside the shoe or on the uppers has an edge to rub on the foot, so they've been comfortable from the first wearing.I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger than your street shoe size. I don't normally wear a wide shoe, but the fit is perfect, so unless you normally wear a narrow shoe, I'd order the wide. I've also found they give me a more adult look than the mary jane-style character shoes. I went from 1 1/2"" to 2"" heels with no problem. The only problem I had is that the sole was a bit too smooth, even after a few wearings, and I had to scuff them quite a bit to keep from slipping & falling!"
156216,1,"These ballet shoes are great! They are true to size. My 5 1/2 year old wears a size two street shoe and these fit her PERFECT! I was worried about them being too small, after reading some of the reviews, but these fit just right. Great product."
353879,1,I am very particular about my boots. It only took a day to brake them in and they are very very comfortable. I would recommend buying these boots. I also just ordered ananother pair.
380503,1,"I have narrow feet/high arches and have always struggled to find a good comfortable walking shoe. This is it and I can put them on without having to break them in before I take a long walk but I wear them as my daily standard. I do trade out the insoles for a hiking shoe insert but this is my 6th pair over 6-7 years. The outer shell stays really nice but the bottom soles do compress over time, about a year to 18 months of continual daily wear/heavy use - including a routine of a 3.5 mile trail walk 5 days a week."
284580,1,"My boots just arrived today and I could not wait to try them on. They fit perfectly and felt very good on my feet, I can't wait until this fall and winter when I will be able to wear these out they are much to hot to wear now. These boots match my school colors so they will look great when I go to late fall football games and winter basketball games. I have to agree with the other reviewers that these boots do fit tight. I am a very avid cycler and have muscular calves and thighs from many miles on my bike. As I zipped these boots up they were tight but not a problem. When I had them zipped all the way up the were just what I wanted. They fit every curve in my legs snuggly and looked great. I had been looking at these boots for about a year trying to decide if I should buy them affraid that they would not work for me because of my athletic legs. When the price got below $40 I had to buy them and find out. I love them and am so glad I bought them, I will be purchasing these in more colors.I am an Amazon Prime member and got free 2 shipping with this order and they arrived on time in perfect condition. Great service, great product!!!"
28032,1,These shoes are adorable and they have tons of detail. Overall these are great shoes.
145559,1,"love them can wear with out socks, great for wearing with jeans love them as much as I love my emu's"
304030,1,"Functionally, these shoes are great. They feel really good. I get good support on my problem feet, and I no longer have knee pain after running.I guess the only draw back is that these shoes look like ""medical"" shoes. The kind that would be prescribed to old folks with foot problems."
349439,1,My husband has a pair of these shoes in brown and wanted another pair in black. I ordered them through a catalogue companyand was informed after months of waiting that the shoes were not yet available. So I surfed the web until I finally found theshoes available via Amazon through Shoe Mall. It is very difficult to get shoes that fit and the Ultra-Walker Men's Quick GripWalking Casuals have proven to be excellent. My husband always had problems getting comfortable shoes and afterhe was diagnosed with PD which created difficulty in walking we found these sturdy well made shoes which are goodlooking to boot. (No pun intended). Thanks to Amazon's prompt service he finally has his much needed shoes.
37343,1,"I wasn't looking for much, just some comfortable, affordable black sneakers. My only complaint is I wish they were a little wider for my paddle feet. The leather also ""squeaks""."
320501,2,when I opened the box and examined the shoes I wasn't expecting the leather at the tip of the shoe to be so bunched up. I can feel the rolls of leather under my toes as I dance. when trying to tighten the strings the one on the leftside on both shoes was glued in place. had to pull very hard to loosen and was afraid would pull the still right out. I will only use these till my new shoes arrive then these will collect dust in the back of my closet.
66631,1,"I decided to try these sandals as a possible replacement for the old Clark's Sunbeat, which no longer lives up to its former standard of quality, unfortunately. These have a very similar appearance and, if anything, are more comfortable. I thought I might dislike the look of the Velcro straps, but it's actually not very noticeable. They are very comfortable and, I thought, more attractive than they appeared in the picture (of course, I'm at an age where ""comfortable"" tends to be synonymous with ""attractive""). I downgraded them one star because the ankle strap tends to ride a little high on me, rubbing right underneath my ankle bone. I think when they get broken in and soften up a little, this will probably cease to be a problem, but for now, it's very irritating after awhile. Overall, though, I like this sandal and look forward to wearing it this summer."
339683,0,"It is ok for this price. But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes.But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes."
324486,0,"But they're not made in Spain anymore, at least not these sandals. I was disappointed to find that the box said ""Made in Spain"" but hidden inside the sandal they're stamped ""Made in China."" I went out of my way to buy shoes that were not made in China, and will be sending them back."
97847,1,"The shoe arrived on time. It is them same as my previous pair that was purchased from a local store. The quality is original. The price is only at par., I would recommend this purchase to some one who just want the convenience of shopping from home."
364155,1,"I am a teacher and at Christmas time each year I ask for a student's name of whom the counselors or home health nurses know is not going to havea Christmas because of family finances and/or struggles. Well, this year I was given the name of a student I had in my own class and whom I had already had sucha great connection and loved this kid. To find out they were not going to have a Christmas broke my heart!! Anyway, through some other sources,I was able to find out what this student wanted more than anything, if they could ask for just even one gift for Christmas. The student said they would love to have some REAL Chuck Taylor blue high-tops !!The fake ones they had saved money to buy at a local ""discount"" store fell apart so fast and they felt they had wasted their money.So ... I ordered these for that student and had them given anonymously. Let me tell you ... when that student entered my classroom the very morning after the y received these surprise gifted shoes ....that kid was so excited to show me, so happy in general, so excited to see everyone and openly socialize with head held high. Wow ... what great things these shoes did for this student in far more ways thanjust keep their feet dry My heart was fulfilled and this student will forever remember these shoes, I am certain!!"
59566,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
25521,1,He said that the shoes fit - to that means that Amazon was right in the sizing. He liked them a lot - he said that they were comfy and light.Thank you - from me - Amazon for the comfortable price of $29.00. Very nice!And He says thank you - To Amazon for coming through with this miricle shoe.
202511,1,I'm not a fan about purchasing shoes online. You really need to try them on. A number of years ago I was fitted for a pair of these by a real shoe salesman. This particular pair and size are perfect for my feet and I was very happy that they were still available. Mine are 10 years old and still in great shape but too slippery for use on my boat. I have a 3rd pair of Sperrys almost 20 years old that I wear around the house as slippers. All of them were made in China.
18582,1,These shoes are great. They go with just about anything. They look great on and are very comfortable. Great price on them too!!
239086,1,We bought these shoes from my son when we was wearing a 4W. We loved them so much that we continued buying them in all sizes up to 8W. My only complaint is they don't make them bigger! He is already in the 7W and gets to wear them only one more size. These are the most rugged and long wearing toddler shoe I have ever bought.
343958,1,I bought these on sale just to try out. I use them as a work shoe and a walking shoe. They are very comfortable and durable. They are also easy to slip on. If you get a chance buy them and try out.
300499,1,After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for. thanks again!!
67314,1,"The product arrived promptly. The quality of item is outstanding and the pricing is reasonable (especially for this particular item - good old reliable Timberland shoes). It really is a great buy - so much so, that I will be purchasing the men's version of this Timberland classic for my son. We know that a Timberland shoes' quality can be counted on.Thank you very much."
198072,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
16032,1,Great boot and very much like the Red Wing that has been discontinued. Comfortable and very happy with the product.
90916,1,I know that US shoe sizes vary so I can wear anywhere from a 6 1/2 to an 8 1/2 depending on the shoe make and model. Typically with European sizes i'm a 37 2/3 - 38. I bought this pair of wedges at a brick and mortar store and the 36.5 fit fine - maybe a little tight but 37 was too big. I just find it very surprising that an Italian made shoe would run large. Otherwise I think this is a universally flattering style and height and shows just the right amount of toe.
292849,1,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
104744,1,I've been wearing this shoe for years. It has always been very comfortable and long-wearing.
341280,1,"This is my second pair of these, I find them to be a bit narrower than I remember, but I am hoping over time they will give a little."
219739,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
21800,1,The Enzo Liberty flat arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered and what I expected. It has become increasingly difficult for me to find 10N in a store so this is the ideal way for me to buy shoes.
229506,1,"This pair is at least my tenth pair of samba classics I have owned. What keeps me buying them over and over again is the comfort, style, and functionality of the shoe. As a soccer player my first pair was purchased to use for indoor soccer but they made their way into my closet as an everyday shoe. They are comfortable enough play a full game on turf or to wear casually for hours at a time. The black shoe with three white stripes on the side is a classic adidas design that looks good with anything. The reason I have had to purchase so many pairs has nothing to do with the quality of the shoe but because these are the shoe I will put on 8/10 times, I usually end up with a new pair about once every year and nothing looks and feels better than having on a fresh pair of sambas."
259971,1,"Converse All Stars, a classic. Love them. They're very comfortable and they're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys.Obviously they do not have much support or cushion (and I wasn't expecting any). If I was going to be on my feet all day or doing something real active this is not the shoe I would choose.The service here was excellent. I couldn't be more pleased."
13442,1,Thank you for excellent service and quick shipping. Even with shipping it cost me less for these shoes than atmy local mall.
213354,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
273807,1,I bought these boots for my husband and he said they run a bit narrow but he likes them and they were a good purchase for the price.
67399,1,The first time I purchase these boots was in 2002 for work. They are very durable and don't feel like mens boots. My daughter took my first pair so I had to order another. They will last a long time.
74520,1,Our grandson loved these shoes the moment he saw them. Not yet 2 yrs old but even gets them on the correct feet.
330057,1,"They are adorable. My son loves them. They are a bit narrow, so if your little one has wide feet, they may be tight."
227610,1,"I have been wearing all stars for way to long now, and these are just as good as I remember. These shoes are iconic, we all know how good these are, the oxfords are a great change of pace from my high tops. These shoes will never go out style!"
265357,1,"My husband loved his first pair of these boots so much, when he wore them out, he wanted another pair. So we ordered them online at Amazon.com, great price and quick service."
9374,1,These shoes are light weight and very comfortable. Great for running and aerobic classes! Love the pink color too...get lots of compliments!
90826,1,"We originally ordered the Bonnie for my husband's mother, but I got an email from the supplier saying they didn't have Bonnie in the WW size she needed. They offered the Annie and refunded the shipping charge. The shoes arrived and my mother-in-law LOVED them!! Now she wants a second pair, which we'll get her. I'm very pleased with the product and the customer service."
355993,1,They're probably the most comfortable footwear I've ever had. They are very easy to break in and they form to your foot! Each pair I get lasts at least 2 years.
69952,1,"Comfortable, warm, and dry. You really don't want to take these off. Tread freely through anything with confidence, and great traction. Awesome value."
247592,1,"looks and feels like $200.00 sheos for $75.00 not bad at all, elegant , comfortable the only think about it is the sole dose't last long enough you might need to replace it within a year"
280253,1,I ordered this shoe for my daughter who has a wide foot. She wears a size 3 street shoe and I ordered a ladies 4.5 for her. It fits just right with a smidge room to grow. Very nice quality item that should last her until she grows out of it.
297160,1,This bag is deep! it fits everything with room left over! i could even fit one of my smaller text books in here.
79469,0,"I don't think that these shoes are original converse ,but in any case the quality is acceptable and they are true to size.It seems that one can not get original stuff these days."
313624,0,I love them they are very cute. I love the heel but they will make your ankles and feet hurt really bad in a very short period of wear. I would recommend them for sitting around but do not expect to go to a club and dance in them. I tried and it was a bad idea. Even with 6 alcoholic beverages I could still feel my poor feet in pain.
274585,1,We use Hi-Tec boots and shoes for storm chasing. They've always made an excellent lightweight hiking boot. The Altitude IV is rough and tough but also looks good for a night out on the town. We get our boots dirty as we trek across Tornado Alley each spring. Our Hi-Tec's take good care of our feet as we concentrate on the weather.Martin LisiusTempest Tours Storm Chasing Expeditions
296658,1,"I love these sandals. I got the brushed leather ones, and they are very comfortable. They have some arch support and all the straps adjust for a comfortable fit. I wear a 7.5 in most shoes and that is what I ordered in these. They fit me perfectly."
136909,1,"I originally bought these to finish off my Tenth Doctor costume, but they're actually really nice shoes. I wear them often and they are quite comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the colored band on the sole has started to come up on one of them... It isn't glued to the shoe very well. But for what I paid for them, I'm willing to let that slide."
338367,1,Our local shoe store stopped carrying childrens shoes because of the economy and big box stores so I was forced to go on line to find quality boot style shoes for my seven year old son--- he absolutely loves them and they fit him well---he says they will smash anything! Looks like they are fun too!
161081,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
28658,1,"I love anything with Mermaids! But aside from that the shoes are very comfortable, the quality is good (a little pricey!)"
198626,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
27719,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
306205,0,"Clark's usually fit me well, and this one was no exception. They should last forever.But:-- they are hard to shine, not like the photo.-- soles look like stiff foam from the side.This sole makes them comfortable, but you'll not win the ""business dresser of the year"" award with these."
262462,1,The timberland field boots are wonderful. They are very comfortable and can be worn with any casual outfit. I own several pairs and I think they are the best Timberland boots made ever. You won't feel disappointed if you spend your money on these boots. They are worth it.
371352,1,Looked all over and could not find these anywhere including the Vans outlet here locally. Arrived on time and fit great.Love my Vans!!!
221787,1,"The slippers fit well (I take a 9 1/2 wide - the slippers come only in whole sizes, but do come in wide widths and a 10 wide fit like a glove). Toasty sheepskin lining keep my toes warm and the padded insoles make for comfortable walking. I'm a happy customer."
2744,1,"Not exactly a shoe saver...but definitely prolongs shoe life if you need to. I had a shoe sole split on me and plugged it up with this stuff and it does the job flawlessly. I also glued my soles back onto my favorite sandals. It's even good on fabric. Patched up a worn section on my Timbuk2 messenger bag.You should definitely put the shoe goo on and leave it for a good long time. I suggest you shoe goo whatever item it is before you go to bed so I has a good 6-8+ hours to set first if you need to immediately use it. Longer than 8 hrs is always better. If the patchjob is on a high wear/flexible area of your shoes, consider a large patch that covers the area well around it--flexing may break the patch again.But I still highly recommend it. This stuff is way cheap. Saving two pairs of shoes has already paid for itself!"
246607,1,"My husband was pleased with the look and fit of these shoes, but wants to make it known that they are misleading by advertising these shoes as all leather. THE SOLES ARE MANMADE. If this makes a difference to you, take note. If not they are beautiful and time will tell if the soles wear well. They are worth the price, but docked one star for manmade soles issue."
13985,0,"I purchased this slipper quite a while ago, and it has worn well. I am rough on slippers so wanted to buy another pair but couldn't find them on Amazon listing. Shame, they are a fantastic slipper!"
239912,2,"I wasn't looking for a good walking shoe, just a specific look; (surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers). Since newer reviews seemed generally positive, I thought I would take a shot. Unfortunately, these aren't acceptable even for light use. Very tight and feel like cardboard. Note: I purchased the navy. The description says ""soft terry lining"" which these don't have. BUT if you look at the different colors shown you will see that some colors DO have a terry lining (red for example) while others (navy, black, denim) clearly don't. I am assuming that the positive reviews are for those colors constructed as described. Sending these back."
20168,1,"I don't buy cheap shoes, because I am a walker and I demand comfort right out of the box. That is why I swear by Rockports. I have a more narrow foot, and many casual shoes in medium width, Clarks, others, are just not quite right in fit. Rockports at width medium just fit me perfect. The World Tour Classic has a great look. Some of the Rockport walker styles look like &#34;old man shoes&#34; however, are comfortable."
277996,1,I have been wearing altitudes for years now and i wouldn't buy another brand/type. These have been on my feet all over the world in all types of weather conditions. I wear the soles out well before anything else wears out. High Quality and highly recommended
379688,1,I can not say enough good things about these shoes I love them. I have ordered other ball room dance shoes and not been as happy as I am with these. They do run a little small as some of the other reviews have complained. These shoes are sturdy and comfortable I can dance all night in them. I will purchase this brand of ball room shoe again.
139299,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
220245,1,"Product arrived quickly, with great packaging. The color was exactly as pictured. The fit is execellent with more arch support than I expected. The shoes appear to be well made without any visible defects. I will probably order a second pair in another color as I am very pleased with these. They are just what I was looking for."
330890,2,"after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart. Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose. I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years(same type of ropers - different colors). I have never had a defective boot like this. I called and e-mailed papa shoe, They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture. If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers, They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me. I called Justin, They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response. I will not buy from Papa Shoe again."
16489,0,"The Copas are classic and are good shoes. The kangaroo leather gives a good touch on the ball.However, I found my pair were too long and too narrow for my wider-than-average foot. If you're over a size D width, you should find a shoes with a broader footplate.Durability of the shoe was a concern. I wore them for a year and half (not full time playing, either) and then they were certifiably worn out. I quickly wore a large hole into the size of the right shoe. Furthermore, the heel became stiff and gave blisters as the shoe aged. They're practically unwearable now.If you have a narrow foot, I recommend. Be careful if you have a wide foot. Also, take good care of the kangaroo leather - keep them clean and lubed up with lotion if you can in order to preserve their lifespan."
330470,1,These shoes are great!!! They are so easy to walk in and feel good on your feet. Looks good w/ everything!!! They are awesome!
341096,0,"THEY WERE NICE LOOKING BOOTS BUT MY HUSBAND WEARS AN 11.5 AND HE HAS A NARROW FOOT BUT THESE WERE TOO SHORT IN LENGTH FOR HIM SO APPARENTLY THEY RUN SMALL. I HAD TO SEND THEM BACK. I FOUND THAT HE COULD WEAR THE 11.5 IN A LOGGERS BOOT JUST FINE JUST CATERPILLARS RUN ON THE SMALL SIDE,SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO FIT THEN YOU SHOULD ORDER A SIZE BIGGER."
244743,1,Bought them on the last Black Friday from Amazon. These are very good boots and fit me perfectly. I usually wear size 10 but choose 9.5 and it was right decision for my narrow foot. The only thing is that the outsole is MaxWear Wedge unlike the pictures that shows Vibram outsole.
248238,1,"Good boots, my only complaint is that they have stretched significantly and are now a bit loose after so much wear."
130582,1,"This was replacement pair and though I was a little disappointed that they are a narrow fit, the length is good and the overall finish good. The value for money is ok."
37066,1,these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym. they are lightweight and very comfortable
316109,1,"design and function is just perfect. i couldn't be more satisfied. uppers, soles, cushioning, velcro function, materials, workmanship is incredibly good. but the item fits almost 1 size bigger (for 5E = EEEEE width). this is apparently due to huge toe-box compartment. which makes the shoe extremely comfortable to wear for long walks. i exchanged sz 10.5, 5E to sz 9.5 5E."
191782,1,these are hands down some of the most comfortable boots on the market. Same as issue minus the EGA on the outside of the boot.
45878,1,I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves Adidas and buys them often. She loves her Christmas gift.
389088,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
88044,1,"Got a picky little critter who thinks she's dancing for the Moscow Ballet...She loves these. Comfortable, good quality and look good."
82792,1,"How do I love thee, Reef Ginger flip flops? Let me count the ways. I am only sad that I could not find a new beige-colored pair this season, because I buy you in every color. I walk the whole of Manhattan in them with no blisters, nothing but total comfort. Literally, these are the one pair of summer shoes I cannot do without."
331106,1,"Wonderful boot for the money. I've been wearing them two-three times a week, with jeans, skirts, dresses, just about everything. Run a bit large, but I'm ok with that so I can wear thick socks this winter. The first time I wore them I was standing for the entire time and my feet hurt and it worried me. No need, after that they have been incredibly comfortable. Love them!"
7133,1,"I wore these sandals from 7 am to 7 pm at a trade show - walked a million square feet in them! They looked good and felt good all day. If they passed that test, a regular old day in the office will be no problem!"
323038,1,"At last, for those of us afflicted with wide feet, one of the top names in motorcycle and cycling shoe manufacturing makes a shoe for us! When I saw the name and the price, I must admit, I didn't even hesitate at the chance to own a pair of Sidi shoes. As for the three straps not being secure enough, which I've read in a few posts before, it's just not true. Maybe if you're logging 40-50 hours per week in the saddle and are planning to go pro or something, but for those of us who ride just to try and stay in shape and have a little fun at the same time, they're GREAT! They are definitely a spring to summer shoe though, so get some toe covers if you plan to use them in the winter months. This is spoken from experience. I couldn't be happier with these shoes and would recommend them hands down to anyone. Oh yeah - I use them with LOOK KEO Sprint Pedals and Grey Grip Cleats, and they work really, really well.These definitely aren't the cheapest shoes on the market, but if you've got wide feet, the Sidi Zeta Megas are worth the few extra bucks!!!-Tim"
377845,1,"I have had these for several months and have been nothing but extremely satisfied. I live in Seattle and make occasional jaunts into the desert climate of Eastern Washington. Very rocky nasty area that claimed a good pair of hiking shoes before I got these. These boots take everything I have thrown at them, including the record breaking snow and ice we have had over the last few months! Tough As Nails, very comfortable, very dry. No issues with lacing or any other problems. I wear a 12 or 13 in regular shoes. Bought the 13 boot and it is spot on. Best.Boots.Ever."
384221,1,"I've bought this style shoe over & over for years for all day comfort. Also having osteoporois, I feel safe from falls. And appearance is important, too, of course. #1 all the way!"
184743,1,"I love these flip flops! I had a pair a few years ago, and my dog chewed them. I searched on Amazon and found another pair. They have a great arch support, are comfortable to walk in, and feel great on your feet."
69809,1,I looked for several weeks for a pair of slippers just like this. They are so close to LL Bean and other famous names. They are absolutely like walking on air. I will definitely come back and reorder when it's time to replace.
231851,1,The timberland field boots are wonderful. They are very comfortable and can be worn with any casual outfit. I own several pairs and I think they are the best Timberland boots made ever. You won't feel disappointed if you spend your money on these boots. They are worth it.
123285,1,"Skechers are the best shoes for me, I have a bad ankle and the shoes are great for my ankle.thanks. dorothy,greenville pa."
286226,1,Seriously these are the best boots ever! They are warm and durable! My feet are never cold now! Fit a little bigger than size..I wear a 91/2 and I got a 9 and they are perfect!
1817,1,"Dark chocolate brown hiking boots. Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend for when we go hiking. He loves them! Lots of grip, very comfortable, and they are very durable as well. Worth the money and then some."
182261,1,"So far they seem really comfy like everyone says, but they run very small. I knew this and order a half size larger. Still too small. Now I have to deal with an Marketplace seller return. Stock these yourself Amazon!"
205059,1,"I have waded through 32F water. I have hiked through bear country. I have been stepped on by trail horses. I have dropped suspicious liquids in lab on the toes. I have abused, battered, left them wet for days, and still they did not mold, smell funny, or disintegrate. I love them. I have owned two pair thus far, and I am looking to buy a third. Putting 20 miles on them a week on the trail, plus 100 mi extra over the summer, and wearing them every day to work/store/farm they typically last me about three years before they get their first worn spots and holes. The only time I ever actually destroyed a pair was a trip out west were I hiked through a 32F river in the morning, went and hiked a snow covered peak that afternoon, and then left the boots on the dashboard in car for a day in the Moab, Utah where the temperature was 110F. The rapid change in temperature caused the boot soles to disintegrate (and by disintegrate I'm talking flake into little tiny pieces here - this was not something your average boot should ever have been subjected to). The upper portion of the boot was just fine, proving again how awesome Asolos are. If I could have found a guy to do it in Moab, I would have put a new set of soles on them and gone on. As it was, I liked the first pair enough I bought another brand new pair when I got back to the east coast.That being said, I find them to be a bit wide in the heel, but a good pair of trekker or wool socks solves that problem.Now time to buy my third pair."
224964,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
63657,1,"great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
